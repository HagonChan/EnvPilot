    "solution": "The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems.

    "solution": "The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories.

    "problem": "Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source",

    "problem": "Dependency resolution selected incompatible libc version",
    "solution": "The root cause was Cargo selecting a libc crate version requiring Rust 2021 edition, incompatible with Rust 1.36.0. The solution was to explicitly pin libc to version 0.2.54 in Cargo.toml, satisfying dependency constraints while maintaining compatibility.",
