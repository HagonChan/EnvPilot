    "problem": "Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.",

    "solution": "The project required CMake version 3.21 or higher, but the default Ubuntu 20.04 repository provided only version 3.16.3. The root cause was an outdated package in the system's default repositories. The solution involved adding the Kitware third-party repository, resolving GPG key verification issues by importing the repository's public key, and installing the updated CMake version.",

    "solution": "The build process encountered a linking error because the zlib development library was missing, which is a common dependency for many compilation tasks.
