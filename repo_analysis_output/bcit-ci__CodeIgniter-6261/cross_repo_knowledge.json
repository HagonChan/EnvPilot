  {
    "problem": "Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.",
    "solution": "The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.",
    "action": "apt-get install -y gnupg curl"
  },
  {
    "problem": "The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux",
    "solution": "The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.",
    "action": "apk add cmake g++ make"
  },
  {
    "problem": "Dependency resolution selected incompatible libc version",
    "solution": "The root cause was Cargo selecting a libc crate version requiring Rust 2021 edition, incompatible with Rust 1.36.0. The solution was to explicitly pin libc to version 0.2.54 in Cargo.toml, satisfying dependency constraints while maintaining compatibility.",
    "action": "sed -i '/byteorder = \"=1.0.0\"/a libc = \"=0.2.54\"' Cargo.toml"
  },
  {
    "problem": "Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.",
    "solution": "System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.",
    "action": "python3.11 -m venv .venv"
  },
  {
    "problem": "Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution",
    "solution": "The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.",
    "action": "apt-get install -y libgtest-dev"
  },
  {
    "problem": "The initial apt-get update command failed due to missing HTTPS transport support",
    "solution": "The system lacked the apt-transport-https package required for accessing HTTPS repositories during package updates. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for secure repository access. The solution was to install apt-transport-https using apt-get install apt-transport-https, which enabled successful HTTPS connections for subsequent package operations.",
    "action": "apt-get install apt-transport-https"
  },
  {
    "problem": "Missing 'pluginbase' dependency caused installation conflicts",
    "solution": "The 'pluginbase' package was required but not installed by default dependency resolution. The root cause was incomplete dependency specification in requirements files. The solution was explicit installation to satisfy the project's runtime needs.",
    "action": "pip install pluginbase"
  },
  {
    "problem": "Package installation command timed out due to excessive execution time",
    "solution": "The 'apt-get install' command for installing Maven and OpenJDK together exceeded the 600-second timeout limit, likely due to large package sizes or network latency. The root cause was the environment's execution time constraint for commands. The solution was to install packages individually to reduce per-command execution time.",
    "action": "apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk"
  },
  {
    "problem": "Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests",
    "solution": "The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.",
    "action": "apt-get install -y python3"
  },
  {
    "problem": "Conflict during installation of a required programming language tool due to pre-existing installation",
    "solution": "The installation script for the programming language tool failed because it detected that the tool was already installed on the Ubuntu system, causing a conflict that halted the process. The root cause was a pre-existing installation conflicting with the new installation attempt, which is a common environment configuration issue when setting up dependencies. The solution was to force the installation by using the '-y' flag to ignore the conflict and proceed with the setup.",

  {
    "problem": "The system package manager command to install Node.js and npm timed out due to execution limits",
    "solution": "The root cause was an unnecessary installation attempt on an environment where Node.js and npm were already pre-installed. The solution involved verifying existing installations using version checks instead of reinstalling, avoiding the timeout issue caused by redundant package management operations.",
    "action": "node --version || echo \"Node.js not installed\" ; npm --version || echo \"npm not installed\""
  },

    "problem": "A required tool for comprehensive testing was not installed in the environment",
    "solution": "The cargo-hack tool was missing, which is essential for running the project's test suite as specified in its continuous integration configuration. The root cause was that this tool was not included in the initial environment setup, leading to command execution failures. The solution was to install cargo-hack using the Cargo package manager, resolving the dependency gap.",
    "action": "cargo install cargo-hack"
  },
  {
    "problem": "Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures",
    "solution": "The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.",
