    "solution": "The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.",

    "solution": "The installation script for the programming language tool failed because it detected that the tool was already installed on the Ubuntu system, causing a conflict that halted the process. The root cause was a pre-existing installation conflicting with the new installation attempt, which is a common environment configuration issue when setting up dependencies. The solution was to force the installation by using the '-y' flag to ignore the conflict and proceed with the setup.",

    "problem": "The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies",
    "solution": "The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.",
