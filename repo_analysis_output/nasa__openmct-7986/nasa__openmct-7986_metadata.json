It often contains important instructions for installation, usage, and any project-specific details.  \n\n2. **Check Dependencies**  \n   Look for dependencies listed in the README or in the `package.json` file. Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or Yarn) installed to manage these dependencies.  \n\n3. **Install Dependencies**  \n   Run the following command to install project dependencies:  \n   ```sh\n   npm install  \n   ```  \n   or, if the project uses Yarn:  \n   ```sh\n   yarn install  \n   ```  \n\n4. **Build the Project**  \n   If the project requires a build step, refer to the `scripts` section in the `package.json` file. Common build commands include:  \n   ```sh\n   npm run build  \n   ```  \n   or  \n   ```sh\n   yarn build  \n   ```  \n\n5. **Configuration**  \n   Check if the project requires any configuration files (e.g., `.env` files, JSON configuration files) and set them up accordingly. The README or project documentation should provide details on this.  \n\n6. **Run Tests (if available)**  \n   If the project provides tests, it\u2019s a good idea to run them to ensure everything is working correctly. Common test commands include:  \n   ```sh\n   npm test  \n   ```  \n   or  \n   ```sh\n   yarn test  \n   ```  \n\n7. **Run the Project**  \n   Follow the instructions in the README to run the project. Common commands might include:  \n   ```sh\n   npm start  \n   ```  \n   or  \n   ```sh\n   yarn start  \n   ```  \n\n8. **Troubleshooting**  \n   If you encounter any issues during installation or while running the project, refer to the project\u2019s issue tracker on GitHub or search for similar issues others may have encountered. Checking for error messages in the terminal can also provide clues.  \n\n9. **Code Linting and Formatting**  \n   Use linters and formatters to ensure code quality and consistency. Common tools include ESLint for linting and Prettier for formatting. You can typically run these with:  \n   ```sh\n   npm run lint  \n   npm run format  \n   ```  \n   or  \n   ```sh\n   yarn lint  \n   yarn format  \n   ```  ",

It is developed at NASA's Ames Research Center, and is being used by NASA for data analysis of spacecraft missions, as well as planning and operation of experimental rover systems. As a generalizable and open source framework, Open MCT could be used as the basis for building applications for planning, operation, and analysis of any systems producing telemetry data.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Please visit our [Official Site](https://nasa.github.io/openmct/) and [Getting Started Guide](https://nasa.github.io/openmct/getting-started/)\n\nOnce you've created something amazing with Open MCT, showcase your work in our GitHub Discussions [Show and Tell](https://github.com/nasa/openmct/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) section. We love seeing unique and wonderful implementations of Open MCT!\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-11-23 at 9 51 36 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4215777/203617422-4d912bfc-766f-4074-8324-409d9bbe7c05.png)\n\n## Building and Running Open MCT Locally\n\nBuilding and running Open MCT in your local dev environment is very easy. Be sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then follow the directions below. Need additional information? Check out the [Getting Started](https://nasa.github.io/openmct/getting-started/) page on our website.\n(These instructions assume you are installing as a non-root user; developers have [reported issues](https://github.com/nasa/openmct/issues/1151) running these steps with root privileges.)\n\n1. Clone the source code:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/nasa/openmct.git\n```\n\n2. (Optional) Install the correct node version using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm):\n\n```sh\nnvm install\n```\n\n3. Install development dependencies (Note: Check the `package.json` engine for our tested and supported node versions):\n\n```sh\nnpm install\n```\n\n4. Run a local development server:\n\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Open MCT is now running, and can be accessed by pointing a web browser at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)\n\nOpen MCT is built using [`npm`](http://npmjs.com/) and [`webpack`](https://webpack.js.org/).\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation is available on the [Open MCT website](https://nasa.github.io/openmct/documentation/).\n\n### Examples\n\nThe clearest examples for developing Open MCT plugins are in the\n[tutorials](https://github.com/nasa/openmct-tutorial) provided in\nour documentation.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> We want Open MCT to be as easy to use, install, run, and develop for as\n> possible, and your feedback will help us get there!\n> Feedback can be provided via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/nasa/openmct/issues/new/choose),\n> [Starting a GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/nasa/openmct/discussions),\n> or by emailing us at [arc-dl-openmct@mail.nasa.gov](mailto:arc-dl-openmct@mail.nasa.gov).\n\n## Developing Applications With Open MCT\n\nFor more on developing with Open MCT, see our documentation for a guide on [Developing Applications with Open MCT](./API.md#starting-an-open-mct-application).\n\n## Compatibility\n\nThis is a fast moving project and we do our best to test and support the widest possible range of browsers, operating systems, and NodeJS APIs. We have a published list of support available in our package.json's `browserslist` key.\n\nThe project utilizes `nvm` to maintain consistent node and npm versions across all projects. For UNIX, MacOS, Windows WSL, and other POSIX-compliant shell environments, click [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). For Windows, check out [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).\n\nIf you encounter an issue with a particular browser, OS, or NodeJS API, please [file an issue](https://github.com/nasa/openmct/issues/new/choose).\n\n## Plugins\n\nOpen MCT can be extended via plugins that make calls to the Open MCT API. A plugin is a group\nof software components (including source code and resources such as images and HTML templates)\nthat is intended to be added or removed as a single unit.\n\nAs well as providing an extension mechanism, most of the core Open MCT codebase is also\nwritten as plugins.\n\nFor information on writing plugins, please see [our API documentation](./API.md#plugins).\n\n## Tests\n\nOur automated test coverage comes in the form of unit, e2e, visual, performance, and security tests.\n\n### Unit Tests\n\nUnit Tests are written for [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/api/edge/global)\nand run by [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io). To run:\n\n`npm test`\n\nThe test suite is configured to load any scripts ending with `Spec.js` found\nin the `src` hierarchy. Full configuration details are found in\n`karma.conf.js`. By convention, unit test scripts should be located\nalongside the units that they test; for example, `src/foo/Bar.js` would be\ntested by `src/foo/BarSpec.js`.\n\n### e2e, Visual, and Performance Testing\n\nOur e2e (end-to-end), Visual, and Performance tests leverage the Playwright framework and are executed using Playwright's test runner, [@playwright/test](https://playwright.dev/).\n\n#### How to Run Tests\n\n- **e2e Tests**: These tests are run on every commit. To run the tests locally, use:\n\n  ```sh\n  npm run test:e2e:ci\n  ```\n\n- **Visual Tests**: For running the visual test suite, use:\n\n  ```sh\n  npm run test:e2e:visual\n  ```\n\n- **Performance Tests**: To initiate the performance tests, enter:\n\n  ```sh\n  npm run test:perf\n  ```\n\nAll tests are located within the `e2e/tests/` directory and are identified by the `*.e2e.spec.js` filename pattern. For more information about the e2e test suite, refer to the [README](./e2e/README.md).\n\n### Security Tests\n\nEach commit is analyzed for known security vulnerabilities using [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-language-guides/codeql-library-for-javascript/). The list of CWE coverage items is available in the [CodeQL docs](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/javascript-cwe/). The CodeQL workflow is specified in the [CodeQL analysis file](./.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml) and the custom [CodeQL config](./.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml).\n\n### Test Reporting and Code Coverage\n\nEach test suite generates a report in CircleCI. For a complete overview of testing functionality, please see our [Circle CI Test Insights Dashboard](https://app.circleci.com/insights/github/nasa/openmct/workflows/the-nightly/overview?branch=master&reporting-window=last-30-days)\n\nOur code coverage is generated during the runtime of our unit, e2e, and visual tests. The combination of those reports is published to [codecov.io](https://app.codecov.io/gh/nasa/openmct/)\n\nFor more on the specifics of our code coverage setup, [see](TESTING.md#code-coverage)\n\n## Glossary\n\nCertain terms are used throughout Open MCT with consistent meanings\nor conventions. Any deviations from the below are issues and should be\naddressed (either by updating this glossary or changing code to reflect\ncorrect usage.) Other developer documentation, particularly in-line\ndocumentation, may presume an understanding of these terms.\n| Term          | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| _plugin_      | A removable, reusable grouping of software elements. The application is composed of plugins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| _composition_ | In the context of a domain object, this term refers to the set of other domain objects that compose or are contained by that object. A domain object's composition is the set of domain objects that should appear immediately beneath it in a tree hierarchy. It is described in its model as an array of ids, providing a means to asynchronously retrieve the actual domain object instances associated with these identifiers. |\n| _description_ | When used as an object property, this term refers to the human-readable description of a thing, usually a single sentence or short paragraph. It is most often used in the context of extensions, domain object models, or other similar application-specific objects.                                                                                           |\n| _domain object_ | A meaningful object to the user and a distinct thing in the work supported by Open MCT. Anything that appears in the left-hand tree is a domain object.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| _identifier_  | A tuple consisting of a namespace and a key, which together uniquely identifies a domain object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| _model_       | The persistent state associated with a domain object. A domain object's model is a JavaScript object that can be converted to JSON without losing information, meaning it contains no methods.                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| _name_        | When used as an object property, this term refers to the human-readable name for a thing. It is most often used in the context of extensions, domain object models, or other similar application-specific objects.                                                                                                                                             |\n| _navigation_  | This term refers to the current state of the application with respect to the user's expressed interest in a specific domain object. For example, when a user clicks on a domain object in the tree, they are navigating to it, and it is thereafter considered the navigated object until the user makes another such choice.                                    |\n| _namespace_   | A name used to identify a persistence store. A running Open MCT application could potentially use multiple persistence stores.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n## Open MCT v2.0.0\n\nSupport for our legacy bundle-based API, and the libraries that it was built on (like Angular 1.x), have now been removed entirely from this repository.\n\nFor now if you have an Open MCT application that makes use of the legacy API, [a plugin](https://github.com/nasa/openmct-legacy-plugin) is provided that bootstraps the legacy bundling mechanism and API. This plugin will not be maintained over the long term however, and the legacy support plugin will not be tested for compatibility with future versions of Open MCT. It is provided for convenience only.\n\n### How do I know if I am using legacy API?\n\nYou might still be using legacy API if your source code\n\n- Contains files named bundle.js, or bundle.json,\n- Makes calls to `openmct.$injector()`, or `openmct.$angular`,\n- Makes calls to `openmct.legacyRegistry`, `openmct.legacyExtension`, or `openmct.legacyBundle`.\n\n### What should I do if I am using legacy API?\n\nPlease refer to [the modern Open MCT API](https://nasa.github.io/openmct/documentation/). Post any questions to the [Discussions section](https://github.com/nasa/openmct/discussions) of the Open MCT GitHub repository.\n\n## Related Repos\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Although Open MCT functions as a standalone project, it is primarily an extensible framework intended to be used as a dependency with users' own plugins and packaging. Furthermore, Open MCT is intended to be used with an HTTP server such as Apache or Nginx. A great example of hosting Open MCT with Apache is `openmct-quickstart` and can be found in the table below.\n\n| Repository | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| [openmct-tutorial](https://github.com/nasa/openmct-tutorial) | A great place for beginners to learn how to use and extend Open MCT. |\n| [openmct-quickstart](https://github.com/scottbell/openmct-quickstart) | A working example of Open MCT integrated with Apache HTTP server, YAMCS telemetry, and Couch DB for persistence.\n| [Open MCT YAMCS Plugin](https://github.com/akhenry/openmct-yamcs) | Plugin for integrating YAMCS telemetry and command server with Open MCT. |\n| [openmct-performance](https://github.com/unlikelyzero/openmct-performance) | Resources for performance testing Open MCT. |\n| [openmct-as-a-dependency](https://github.com/unlikelyzero/openmct-as-a-dependency) | An advanced guide for users on how to build, develop, and test Open MCT when it's used as a dependency. |\n\n"
