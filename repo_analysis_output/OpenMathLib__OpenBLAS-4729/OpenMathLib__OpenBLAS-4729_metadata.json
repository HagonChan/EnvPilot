It contains important instructions for installation, usage, and project-specific details.  \n\n2. **Check Dependencies**  \n   Look for dependencies listed in the README or package management files like `CMakeLists.txt` (for CMake), `Makefile` (for Make), or `vcpkg.json` (for vcpkg). Ensure the required compiler and libraries are installed.  \n\n3. **Build Tool**  \n   Identify the build tool the project is using: Make, CMake, or another. This information should be available in the README or through project configuration files (e.g., `Makefile` for Make, `CMakeLists.txt` for CMake).  \n\n4. **Build the Project**  \n   Depending on the build tool, use the appropriate commands to build the project:  \n\n   - For Make:  \n     ```  \n     make  \n     ```  \n   - For CMake:  \n     ```  \n     mkdir build  \n     cd build  \n     cmake ..  \n     make  \n     ```  \n\n5. **Configuration**  \n   Check if the project requires configuration files (e.g., `.conf` files, `config.h` headers) to be set up. This may involve providing paths to dependencies or setting compilation flags.  \n\n6. **Run Tests (if available)**  \n   If the project provides tests, it's a good idea to run them to ensure everything is working correctly. Common testing frameworks for C/C++ include Google Test (gtest), Catch2, and Boost.Test.  \n   - For Google Test:  \n     ```  \n     ./path/to/test_executable  \n     ```  \n   - For Catch2:  \n     ```  \n     ./path/to/test_executable  \n     ```  \n\n7. **Run the Project**  \n   Follow the instructions in the README to run the project. This could involve running a specific executable, starting a server, or executing a specific command.  \n\n8. **Troubleshooting**  \n   If you encounter issues during installation or while running the project, refer to the project's issue tracker on GitHub or search for similar issues.  \n\n9. **Documentation**  \n   Review additional documentation such as Doxygen files, API documentation, or inline comments in the code. Understanding the documentation provides better insights into the project\u2019s structure and usage.",

On that site you will likewise find documentation for the reference implementation of the higher-level library LAPACK - the **L**inear **A**lgebra **Pack**age that comes included with OpenBLAS. If you are looking for a general primer or refresher on Linear Algebra, the set of six\n20-minute lecture videos by Prof. Gilbert Strang on either MIT OpenCourseWare <https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-010-a-2020-vision-of-linear-algebra-spring-2020/> or Youtube <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61iQEFiWLE21EJCxwmWvvek> may be helpful.\n\n## Binary Packages\n\nWe provide official binary packages for the following platform:\n\n  * Windows x86/x86_64\n\nYou can download them from [file hosting on sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openblas/files/) or from the Releases section of the github project page, [https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/releases](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/releases).\n\n## Installation from Source\n\nDownload from project homepage, https://xianyi.github.com/OpenBLAS/, or check out the code\nusing Git from https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS.git. (If you want the most up to date version, be\nsure to use the develop branch - master is several years out of date due to a change of maintainership.)\nBuildtime parameters can be chosen in Makefile.rule, see there for a short description of each option.\nMost can also be given directly on the make or cmake command line.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nBuilding OpenBLAS requires the following to be installed:\n\n* GNU Make\n* A C compiler, e.g. GCC or Clang\n* A Fortran compiler (optional, for LAPACK)\n* IBM MASS (optional, see below)\n\n### Normal compile\n\nSimply invoking `make` (or `gmake` on BSD) will detect the CPU automatically.\nTo set a specific target CPU, use `make TARGET=xxx`, e.g. `make TARGET=NEHALEM`.\nThe full target list is in the file `TargetList.txt`, other build optionss are documented in Makefile.rule and\ncan either be set there (typically by removing the comment character from the respective line), or used on the\n`make` command line. \nNote that when you run `make install` after building, you need to repeat all command line options you provided to `make`\nin the build step, as some settings like the supported maximum number of threads are automatically derived from the\nbuild host by default, which might not be what you want.\nFor building with `cmake`, the usual conventions apply, i.e. create a build directory either underneath the toplevel\nOpenBLAS source directory or separate from it, and invoke `cmake` there with the path to the source tree and any \nbuild options you plan to set.\n\n### Cross compile\n\nSet `CC` and `FC` to point to the cross toolchains, and set `HOSTCC` to your host C compiler.\nThe target must be specified explicitly when cross compiling.\n\nExamples:\n\n* On an x86 box, compile this library for a loongson3a CPU:\n  ```sh\n  make BINARY=64 CC=mips64el-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc FC=mips64el-unknown-linux-gnu-gfortran HOSTCC=gcc TARGET=LOONGSON3A\n  ```\n  or same with the newer mips-crosscompiler put out by Loongson that defaults to the 32bit ABI:\n  ```sh\n  make HOSTCC=gcc CC='/opt/mips-loongson-gcc7.3-linux-gnu/2019.06-29/bin/mips-linux-gnu-gcc -mabi=64' FC='/opt/mips-loongson-gcc7.3-linux-gnu/2019.06-29/bin/mips-linux-gnu-gfortran -mabi=64' TARGET=LOONGSON3A\n  ```\n\n* On an x86 box, compile this library for a loongson3a CPU with loongcc (based on Open64) compiler:\n  ```sh\n  make CC=loongcc FC=loongf95 HOSTCC=gcc TARGET=LOONGSON3A CROSS=1 CROSS_SUFFIX=mips64el-st-linux-gnu-   NO_LAPACKE=1 NO_SHARED=1 BINARY=32\n  ```\n\n### Debug version\n\nA debug version can be built using `make DEBUG=1`.\n\n### Compile with MASS support on Power CPU (optional)\n\nThe [IBM MASS](https://www.ibm.com/support/home/product/W511326D80541V01/other_software/mathematical_acceleration_subsystem) library consists of a set of mathematical functions for C, C++, and Fortran applications that are tuned for optimum performance on POWER architectures.\nOpenBLAS with MASS requires a 64-bit, little-endian OS on POWER.\nThe library can be installed as shown:\n\n* On Ubuntu:\n  ```sh\n  wget -q http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/server/POWER/Linux/xl-compiler/eval/ppc64le/ubuntu/public.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add -\n  echo \"deb http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/server/POWER/Linux/xl-compiler/eval/ppc64le/ubuntu/ trusty main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ibm-xl-compiler-eval.list\n  sudo apt-get update\n  sudo apt-get install libxlmass-devel.8.1.5\n  ```\n\n* On RHEL/CentOS:\n  ```sh\n  wget http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/server/POWER/Linux/xl-compiler/eval/ppc64le/rhel7/repodata/repomd.xml.key\n  sudo rpm --import repomd.xml.key\n  wget http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/server/POWER/Linux/xl-compiler/eval/ppc64le/rhel7/ibm-xl-compiler-eval.repo\n  sudo cp ibm-xl-compiler-eval.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/\n  sudo yum install libxlmass-devel.8.1.5\n  ```\n\nAfter installing the MASS library, compile OpenBLAS with `USE_MASS=1`.\nFor example, to compile on Power8 with MASS support: `make USE_MASS=1 TARGET=POWER8`.\n\n### Install to a specific directory (optional)\n\nUse `PREFIX=` when invoking `make`, for example\n\n```sh\nmake install PREFIX=your_installation_directory\n```\n(along with all options you added on the `make` command line in the preceding build step)\nThe default installation directory is `/opt/OpenBLAS`.\n\n## Supported CPUs and Operating Systems\n\nPlease read `GotoBLAS_01Readme.txt` for older CPU models already supported by the 2010 GotoBLAS.\n\n### Additional supported CPUs\n\n#### x86/x86-64\n\n- **Intel Xeon 56xx (Westmere)**: Used GotoBLAS2 Nehalem codes.\n- **Intel Sandy Bridge**: Optimized Level-3 and Level-2 BLAS with AVX on x86-64.\n- **Intel Haswell**: Optimized Level-3 and Level-2 BLAS with AVX2 and FMA on x86-64.\n- **Intel Skylake-X**: Optimized Level-3 and Level-2 BLAS with AVX512 and FMA on x86-64.\n- **Intel Cooper Lake**: as Skylake-X with improved BFLOAT16 support.\n- **AMD Bobcat**: Used GotoBLAS2 Barcelona codes.\n- **AMD Bulldozer**: x86-64 ?GEMM FMA4 kernels.

For cpu generations not included in this list, the corresponding older model is used. If you also specify `DYNAMIC_OLDER=1`, specific support for Penryn, Dunnington, Opteron, Opteron/SSE3, Bobcat, Atom and Nano is added. Finally there is an option `DYNAMIC_LIST` that allows to specify an individual list of targets to include instead of the default.\n\n`DYNAMIC_ARCH` is also supported on **x86**, where it translates to Katmai, Coppermine, Northwood, Prescott, Banias,\nCore2, Penryn, Dunnington, Nehalem, Athlon, Opteron, Opteron_SSE3, Barcelona, Bobcat, Atom and Nano.\n\nOn **ARMV8**, it enables support for CortexA53, CortexA57, CortexA72, CortexA73, Falkor, ThunderX, ThunderX2T99, TSV110 as well as generic ARMV8 cpus. If compiler support for SVE is available at build time, support for NeoverseN2, NeoverseV1 as well as generic ArmV8SVE targets is also enabled.\n\nFor **POWER**, the list encompasses POWER6, POWER8 and POWER9. POWER10 is additionally available if a sufficiently recent compiler is used for the build.\n\non **ZARCH** it comprises Z13 and Z14 as well as generic zarch support.\n\nThe `TARGET` option can be used in conjunction with `DYNAMIC_ARCH=1` to specify which cpu model should be assumed for all the\ncommon code in the library, usually you will want to set this to the oldest model you expect to encounter.\nPlease note that it is not possible to combine support for different architectures, so no combined 32 and 64 bit or x86_64 and arm64 in the same library.\n\n### Supported OS\n\n- **GNU/Linux**\n- **MinGW or Visual Studio (CMake)/Windows**: Please read <https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/wiki/How-to-use-OpenBLAS-in-Microsoft-Visual-Studio>.\n- **Darwin/macOS/OSX/iOS**: Experimental. Although GotoBLAS2 already supports Darwin, we are not OSX/iOS experts.\n- **FreeBSD**: Supported by the community. We don't actively test the library on this OS.\n- **OpenBSD**: Supported by the community. We don't actively test the library on this OS.\n- **NetBSD**: Supported by the community. We don't actively test the library on this OS.\n- **DragonFly BSD**: Supported by the community. We don't actively test the library on this OS.\n- **Android**: Supported by the community. Please read <https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/wiki/How-to-build-OpenBLAS-for-Android>.\n- **AIX**: Supported on PPC up to POWER10\n- **Haiku**: Supported by the community. We don't actively test the library on this OS.\n- **SunOS**: Supported by the community. We don't actively test the library on this OS.\n- **Cortex-M**: Supported by the community. Please read <https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/wiki/How-to-use-OpenBLAS-on-Cortex-M>.\n\n## Usage\n\nStatically link with `libopenblas.a` or dynamically link with `-lopenblas` if OpenBLAS was\ncompiled as a shared library.\n\n### Setting the number of threads using environment variables\n\nEnvironment variables are used to specify a maximum number of threads.\nFor example,\n\n```sh\nexport OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=4\nexport GOTO_NUM_THREADS=4\nexport OMP_NUM_THREADS=4\n```\n\nThe priorities are `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS` > `GOTO_NUM_THREADS` > `OMP_NUM_THREADS`.\n\nIf you compile this library with `USE_OPENMP=1`, you should set the `OMP_NUM_THREADS`\nenvironment variable; OpenBLAS ignores `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS` and `GOTO_NUM_THREADS` when\ncompiled with `USE_OPENMP=1`.\n\n### Setting the number of threads at runtime\n\nWe provide the following functions to control the number of threads at runtime:\n\n```c\nvoid goto_set_num_threads(int num_threads);\nvoid openblas_set_num_threads(int num_threads);\n```\nNote that these are only used once at library initialization, and are not available for\nfine-tuning thread numbers in individual BLAS calls. \nIf you compile this library with `USE_OPENMP=1`, you should use the above functions too.\n\n## Reporting bugs\n\nPlease submit an issue in https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues.\n\n## Contact\n\n* OpenBLAS users mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openblas-users\n* OpenBLAS developers mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openblas-dev\n\n## Change log\n\nPlease see Changelog.txt to view the differences between OpenBLAS and GotoBLAS2 1.13 BSD version.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n* Please read the [FAQ](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/wiki/Faq) first.\n* Please use GCC version 4.6 and above to compile Sandy Bridge AVX kernels on Linux/MinGW/BSD.\n* Please use Clang version 3.1 and above to compile the library on Sandy Bridge microarchitecture.\n  Clang 3.0 will generate the wrong AVX binary code.\n* Please use GCC version 6 or LLVM version 6 and above to compile Skylake AVX512 kernels.\n* The number of CPUs/cores should be less than or equal to 256. On Linux `x86_64` (`amd64`),\n  there is experimental support for up to 1024 CPUs/cores and 128 numa nodes if you build\n  the library with `BIGNUMA=1`.\n* OpenBLAS does not set processor affinity by default.\n  On Linux, you can enable processor affinity by commenting out the line `NO_AFFINITY=1` in\n  Makefile.rule. However, note that this may cause\n  [a conflict with R parallel](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-hpc/2012-April/001348.html).\n* On Loongson 3A, `make test` may fail with a `pthread_create` error (`EAGAIN`).\n  However, it will be okay when you run the same test case on the shell.\n\n## Contributing\n\n1.
