    "problem": "The test runner tool (tox) was not installed in the environment",
    "solution": "The root cause was the absence of the tox package, which is required for executing the test suite as per the project's CI configuration. Tox manages virtual environments and test execution. The solution was to install tox using the Python package manager.",

  },
  {
    "problem": "The pytest command was unavailable after dependency installation failures",
    "solution": "The initial pip install failed partially due to typed-ast compilation issues, leaving pytest uninstalled. The root cause was dependency installation not completing successfully. The solution was to install pytest individually using pip to enable test execution.",

  {
    "problem": "The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux",
    "solution": "The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.",

  {
    "problem": "SSL/TLS connection errors when downloading dependencies or updating packages",
    "solution": "The root cause was likely outdated CA certificates or incorrect system time, which prevented secure connections to repositories. Attempts to update CA certificates failed due to repository configuration issues. The solution was to update CA certificates using apt-get, but it was ineffective because the repository itself was unreachable or misconfigured.",

    "problem": "Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures",
    "solution": "The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.",

    "solution": "The nose test runner is incompatible with Python 3.13 and above because the imp module was removed. The solution is to switch to pytest as the test runner. The root cause was an outdated test framework dependency in the project configuration. The effective solution was installing pytest using pip.",

    "problem": "Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies",
    "solution": "The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.",
