    "problem": "Pip installation of Conan failed due to externally managed environment restrictions",
    "solution": "The Ubuntu environment was configured with an immutable package manager (Nix), preventing direct pip installations. The root cause was system-level package management constraints enforcing PEP 668. The solution was to bypass system restrictions by creating a Python virtual environment and installing Conan within it.",

    "problem": "Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures",
