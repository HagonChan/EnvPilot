    "problem": "Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures",
    "solution": "The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.",

  {
    "problem": "The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux",
    "solution": "The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.",

  {
    "problem": "Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories",
    "solution": "The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.",

  {
    "problem": "Dependency conflicts prevented successful installation of development dependencies",
    "solution": "The root cause was incompatible peer dependencies between packages, specifically rollup and rollup-plugin-babel, as indicated by the ERESOLVE error. The solution was to bypass strict peer dependency checks using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, enabling the installation to complete despite potential version mismatches.",
    "action": "npm install --only=dev --legacy-peer-deps"

  {
    "problem": "Cargo remained inaccessible after installation due to incorrect PATH configuration",
    "solution": "The root cause was an improperly configured PATH environment variable that did not include the correct Cargo binary directory (/root/.cargo/bin). Sourcing the environment file alone failed because the PATH entry was incorrect. The solution required manually adding the precise binary path to the PATH variable to make cargo commands available.",

    "problem": "The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment",
    "solution": "The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.",

  {
    "problem": "Git dependency resolved to an incompatible revision",
    "solution": "The root cause was the iovec git dependency defaulting to the latest commit, potentially incompatible with the toolchain. The solution was to pin it to a specific revision (v0.1.4) known to be compatible with the project era and dependencies.",

  {
    "problem": "The initial dependency installation failed because the sudo command was not found",
    "solution": "The environment lacked the sudo package, but since the session had root privileges, it was unnecessary. The root cause was an incorrect command syntax for the environment. The solution was to omit sudo from package installation commands.",

  {
    "problem": "Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries",
    "solution": "The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.",

  },
  {
    "problem": "The dependency lock file was missing, causing failure in resolving dependencies during project build.",
    "solution": "The root cause was the absence of Cargo.lock, which is essential for consistent dependency resolution in Rust projects. Without it, cargo commands failed to parse dependencies. The solution was to regenerate the lock file using cargo generate-lockfile to ensure all dependencies are properly resolved and locked.",

    "problem": "Dependency lock file incompatibility with the older toolchain",
    "solution": "The `Cargo.lock` file was generated by a newer version of Cargo and was incompatible with the older Rust toolchain (1.26.0). The root cause was a version mismatch in the lock file serialization format. The solution was to remove the lock file to allow Cargo to regenerate it with a compatible format for the toolchain.",

  },
  {
    "problem": "The initial ./waf command failed due to lack of execute permission",
    "solution": "The waf script was not executable, which is required to run build commands. The root cause was missing execute permissions on the script. The solution was to add execute permissions using chmod.",

  {
    "problem": "Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.",
    "solution": "System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.",
