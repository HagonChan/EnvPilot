    "solution": "Node Version Manager (nvm) was missing from the Ubuntu system, preventing installation and switching to the required Node.js version (>=20.11.1 <22) specified in the project. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking nvm. The solution involved installing nvm using its official installation script to enable Node.js version management.",

    "solution": "Node.js and npm were missing, preventing installation of pnpm which is required for the project. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking essential JavaScript tooling.

    "problem": "A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions",
    "solution": "The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.",

The root cause was the absence of both pnpm and npm (which could install pnpm) in the environment configuration. Standard installation via apt-get for npm faced timeouts due to environmental constraints, so the effective solution was to install pnpm directly using its official installation script.",

The root cause was an incomplete initial system configuration, as the tools were not pre-installed. The solution was to install the missing packages using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability.",
