    "solution": "The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.",

    "problem": "The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation",
    "solution": "The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.",

    "solution": "The build-essential package, which includes compilers and build tools like gcc and make, was not installed in the Ubuntu environment. The root cause was an incomplete system package configuration.

    "problem": "The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux",
    "solution": "The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.",

  {
    "problem": "Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution",
    "solution": "The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.",

    "problem": "A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version",
    "solution": "The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.",

    "solution": "The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.",
