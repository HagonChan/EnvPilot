It usually contains important instructions for installation, usage, and any project-specific details. Some projects include a `Dockerfile` script, which you can review and reuse as needed.  \n\n2. **Check Dependencies**  \n   Look for dependencies listed in the README or in a `requirements.txt` file. Ensure you have the required versions of Python and any other libraries/packages.  \n\n3. **Virtual Environment**  \n   It\u2019s a good practice to create a virtual environment for each Python project to avoid conflicts with system-wide packages. Use the command:  \n   ```sh\n   python3.X -m venv .venv  \n   ```  \n\n4. **Configuration**  \n   Check if the project requires any configuration files (e.g., `.env` files) and set them up accordingly.  \n\n5. **Build the Project (rare cases)**  \n   Some projects might require building before usage, especially if they include C extensions or require compiling assets.  \n\n6. **Run Tests (if available)**  \n   If the project provides tests, it\u2019s a good idea to run them to ensure everything is working correctly. Some projects include a `tox.ini` file, which allows you to run tests with `tox`. Install `tox` first using:  \n   ```sh\n   pip install tox  \n   ```  \n\n7. **Run the Project**  \n   Follow the instructions in the README to run the project. This could involve running a script, starting a server, or executing a specific command.  \n\n8. **Troubleshooting**  \n   If you encounter issues during installation or while running the project, refer to the project\u2019s issue tracker on GitHub or search for similar issues others may have encountered.  \n\n9. **Test Suite Results**  \n   When running a test suite, it is normal for some test cases to fail. If the percentage of failing test cases is less than 20% of the total number, it is considered acceptable, and further investigation is not necessary.  \n\n10. **Shell Compatibility**  \n   In some shells, the `source` command may not work. In such cases, replace `source` with just `.` (a single dot). For example:  \n   ```sh\n   . .venv/bin/activate  \n   ```  \n\n11. **Avoid Using Conda**  \n   Instead of Conda, prefer the following commands to set up your virtual environment:  \n   ```sh\n   python -m venv .venv  \n   . .venv/bin/activate  \n   ```  ",

See\nthe `AUTHORS.rst <AUTHORS.rst>`_ file for a complete list of contributors.\n\nIt is currently maintained by a team of volunteers.\n\nWebsite: http://scikit-learn.org\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nDependencies\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nscikit-learn requires:\n\n- Python (>= 2.7 or >= 3.4)\n- NumPy (>= 1.8.2)\n- SciPy (>= 0.13.3)\n\nFor running the examples Matplotlib >= 1.3.1 is required.\n\nscikit-learn also uses CBLAS, the C interface to the Basic Linear Algebra\nSubprograms library. scikit-learn comes with a reference implementation, but\nthe system CBLAS will be detected by the build system and used if present.\nCBLAS exists in many implementations; see `Linear algebra libraries\n<http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/computational_performance.html#linear-algebra-libraries>`_\nfor known issues.\n\nUser installation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you already have a working installation of numpy and scipy,\nthe easiest way to install scikit-learn is using ``pip`` ::\n\n    pip install -U scikit-learn\n\nor ``conda``::\n\n    conda install scikit-learn\n\nThe documentation includes more detailed `installation instructions <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html>`_.\n\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nWe welcome new contributors of all experience levels. The scikit-learn\ncommunity goals are to be helpful, welcoming, and effective. The\n`Development Guide <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/index.html>`_\nhas detailed information about contributing code, documentation, tests, and\nmore. We've included some basic information in this README.\n\nImportant links\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Official source code repo: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn\n- Download releases: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scikit-learn\n- Issue tracker: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues\n\nSource code\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou can check the latest sources with the command::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git\n\nSetting up a development environment\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nQuick tutorial on how to go about setting up your environment to\ncontribute to scikit-learn: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nTesting\n~~~~~~~\n\nAfter installation, you can launch the test suite from outside the\nsource directory (you will need to have the ``pytest`` package installed)::\n\n    pytest sklearn\n\nSee the web page http://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/advanced_installation.html#testing\nfor more information.\n\n    Random number generation can be controlled during testing by setting\n    the ``SKLEARN_SEED`` environment variable.\n\nSubmitting a Pull Request\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBefore opening a Pull Request, have a look at the\nfull Contributing page to make sure your code complies\nwith our guidelines: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/index.html\n\n\nProject History\n---------------\n\nThe project was started in 2007 by David Cournapeau as a Google Summer\nof Code project, and since then many volunteers have contributed.
