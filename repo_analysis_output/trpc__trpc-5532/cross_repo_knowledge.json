    "problem": "The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation",
    "solution": "The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.",

    "problem": "Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.",
    "solution": "The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.",

The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after resolving a dpkg state issue.",

    "problem": "The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux",
    "solution": "The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.",

  {
    "problem": "The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.",
    "solution": "The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.",

    "solution": "The pnpm package manager was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for dependency management in Node.js projects. The root cause was the absence of both pnpm and npm (which could install pnpm) in the environment configuration. Standard installation via apt-get for npm faced timeouts due to environmental constraints, so the effective solution was to install pnpm directly using its official installation script.",

    "solution": "The root cause was that the apt-get command exceeded the allowed execution limit, likely due to network latency or repository issues, but it was unnecessary because Node.js and npm were already installed in the environment.
