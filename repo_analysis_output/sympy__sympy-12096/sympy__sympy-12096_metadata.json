It usually contains important instructions for installation, usage, and any project-specific details. Some projects include a `Dockerfile` script, which you can review and reuse as needed.  \n\n2. **Check Dependencies**  \n   Look for dependencies listed in the README or in a `requirements.txt` file. Ensure you have the required versions of Python and any other libraries/packages.  \n\n3. **Virtual Environment**  \n   It\u2019s a good practice to create a virtual environment for each Python project to avoid conflicts with system-wide packages. Use the command:  \n   ```sh\n   python3.X -m venv .venv  \n   ```  \n\n4. **Configuration**  \n   Check if the project requires any configuration files (e.g., `.env` files) and set them up accordingly.  \n\n5. **Build the Project (rare cases)**  \n   Some projects might require building before usage, especially if they include C extensions or require compiling assets.  \n\n6. **Run Tests (if available)**  \n   If the project provides tests, it\u2019s a good idea to run them to ensure everything is working correctly. Some projects include a `tox.ini` file, which allows you to run tests with `tox`. Install `tox` first using:  \n   ```sh\n   pip install tox  \n   ```  \n\n7. **Run the Project**  \n   Follow the instructions in the README to run the project. This could involve running a script, starting a server, or executing a specific command.  \n\n8. **Troubleshooting**  \n   If you encounter issues during installation or while running the project, refer to the project\u2019s issue tracker on GitHub or search for similar issues others may have encountered.  \n\n9. **Test Suite Results**  \n   When running a test suite, it is normal for some test cases to fail. If the percentage of failing test cases is less than 20% of the total number, it is considered acceptable, and further investigation is not necessary.  \n\n10. **Shell Compatibility**  \n   In some shells, the `source` command may not work. In such cases, replace `source` with just `.` (a single dot). For example:  \n   ```sh\n   . .venv/bin/activate  \n   ```  \n\n11. **Avoid Using Conda**  \n   Instead of Conda, prefer the following commands to set up your virtual environment:  \n   ```sh\n   python -m venv .venv  \n   . .venv/bin/activate  \n   ```  ",

Feel free\nto ask us anything there. We have a very welcoming and helpful community.\n\n\nDownload\n--------\n\nGet the latest version of SymPy from\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/sympy/\n\nTo get the git version do\n\n::\n\n    $ git clone git://github.com/sympy/sympy.git\n\nFor other options (tarballs, debs, etc.), see\nhttp://docs.sympy.org/dev/install.html.\n\nDocumentation and usage\n-----------------------\n\nEverything is at:\n\nhttp://docs.sympy.org/\n\nYou can generate everything at the above site in your local copy of SymPy by::\n\n    $ cd doc\n    $ make html\n\nThen the docs will be in `_build/html`. If you don't want to read that, here\nis a short usage:\n\nFrom this directory, start python and::\n\n    >>> from sympy import Symbol, cos\n    >>> x = Symbol('x')\n    >>> e = 1/cos(x)\n    >>> print e.series(x, 0, 10)\n    1 + x**2/2 + 5*x**4/24 + 61*x**6/720 + 277*x**8/8064 + O(x**10)\n\nSymPy also comes with a console that is a simple wrapper around the\nclassic python console (or IPython when available) that loads the\nsympy namespace and executes some common commands for you.\n\nTo start it, issue::\n\n    $ bin/isympy\n\nfrom this directory if SymPy is not installed or simply::\n\n    $ isympy\n\nif SymPy is installed.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nSymPy has a hard dependency on the `mpmath <http://mpmath.org/>`\nlibrary (version >= 0.19).  You should install it first, please refer to\nthe mpmath installation guide:\n\nhttps://github.com/fredrik-johansson/mpmath#1-download--installation\n\nTo install SymPy itself, then simply run::\n\n    $ python setup.py install\n\nIf you install it system-wide, you may need to prefix the previous command with ``sudo``::\n\n    $ sudo python setup.py install\n\nSee http://docs.sympy.org/dev/install.html for more information.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nWe welcome contributions from anyone, even if you are new to open\nsource. Please read our `introduction to contributing\n<https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/Introduction-to-contributing>`_. If you\nare new and looking for some way to contribute a good place to start is to\nlook at the issues tagged `Easy to Fix\n<https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Easy+to+Fix%22>`_.\n\nPlease note that all participants of this project are expected to follow our\nCode of Conduct. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its\nterms. See `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md <CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`_.\n\nTests\n-----\n\nTo execute all tests, run::\n\n    $./setup.py test\n\nin the current directory.\n\nFor more fine-grained running of tests or doctest, use ``bin/test`` or\nrespectively ``bin/doctest``. The master branch is automatically tested by\nTravis CI.\n\nTo test pull requests, use `sympy-bot <https://github.com/sympy/sympy-bot>`_.\n\nUsage in Python 3\n-----------------\n\nSymPy also supports Python 3. If you want to install the latest version in\nPython 3, get the Python 3 tarball from\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/sympy/\n\nTo install the SymPy for Python 3, simply run the above commands with a Python\n3 interpreter.\n\nClean\n-----\n\nTo clean everything (thus getting the same tree as in the repository)::\n\n    $ ./setup.py clean\n\nYou can also clean things with git using::\n\n    $ git clean -Xdf\n\nwhich will clear everything ignored by ``.gitignore``, and::\n\n    $ git clean -df\n\nto clear all untracked files.  You can revert the most recent changes in git\nwith::\n\n    $ git reset --hard\n\nWARNING: The above commands will all clear changes you may have made, and you\nwill lose them forever. Be sure to check things with ``git status``, ``git\ndiff``, ``git clean -Xn`` and ``git clean -n`` before doing any of those.\n\nBugs\n----\n\nOur issue tracker is at https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues.  Please report\nany bugs that you find.  Or, even better, fork the repository on GitHub and\ncreate a pull request.  We welcome all changes, big or small, and we will help\nyou make the pull request if you are new to git (just ask on our mailing list\nor Gitter).\n\nBrief History\n-------------\n\nSymPy was started by Ond\u0159ej \u010cert\u00edk in 2005, he wrote some code during the\nsummer, then he wrote some more code during the summer 2006. In February 2007,\nFabian Pedregosa joined the project and helped fixed many things, contributed\ndocumentation and made it alive again. 5 students (Mateusz Paprocki, Brian\nJorgensen, Jason Gedge, Robert Schwarz and Chris Wu) improved SymPy incredibly\nduring the summer 2007 as part of the Google Summer of Code. Pearu Peterson\njoined the development during the summer 2007 and he has made SymPy much more\ncompetitive by rewriting the core from scratch, that has made it from 10x to\n100x faster. Jurjen N.E. Bos has contributed pretty printing and other patches.\nFredrik Johansson has written mpmath and contributed a lot of patches.\n\nSymPy has participated in every Google Summer of Code since 2007. You can see\nhttps://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki#google-summer-of-code for full details.\nEach year has improved SymPy by bounds. Most of SymPy's development has come\nfrom Google Summer of Code students.\n\nIn 2011, Ond\u0159ej \u010cert\u00edk stepped down as lead developer, with Aaron Meurer, who\nalso started as a Google Summer of Code student, taking his place. Ond\u0159ej\n\u010cert\u00edk is still active in the community, but is too busy with work and family\nto play a lead development role.\n\nSince then, a lot more people have joined the development and some people have\nalso left. You can see the full list in doc/src/aboutus.rst, or online at:\n\nhttp://docs.sympy.org/dev/aboutus.html#sympy-development-team\n\nThe git history goes back to 2007, when development moved from svn to hg.  To\nsee the history before that point, look at http://github.com/sympy/sympy-old.\n\nYou can use git to see the biggest developers.  The command::\n\n     $ git shortlog -ns\n\nwill show each developer, sorted by commits to the project.  The command::\n\n     $ git shortlog -ns --since=\"1 year\"\n\nwill show the top developers from the last year.\n\nCitation\n--------\n\nTo cite SymPy in publications use\n\n    Meurer A, Smith CP, Paprocki M, \u010cert\u00edk O, Kirpichev SB, Rocklin M, Kumar A,\n    Ivanov S, Moore JK, Singh S, Rathnayake T, Vig S, Granger BE, Muller RP,\n    Bonazzi F, Gupta H, Vats S, Johansson F, Pedregosa F, Curry MJ, Terrel AR,\n    Rou\u010dka \u0160, Saboo A, Fernando I, Kulal S, Cimrman R, Scopatz A.
