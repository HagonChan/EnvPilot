If you\nrun the installer or the `self-update` command the appropriate Composer version for your PHP\nshould be automatically selected.\n\n#### Binary dependencies\n\n- `7z` (or `7zz`)\n- `unzip` (if `7z` is missing)\n- `gzip`\n- `tar`\n- `unrar`\n- `xz`\n- Git (`git`)\n- Mercurial (`hg`)\n- Fossil (`fossil`)\n- Perforce (`p4`)\n- Subversion (`svn`)\n\nIt's important to note that the need for these binary dependencies may vary\ndepending on individual use cases. However, for most users, only 2 dependencies\nare essential for Composer: `7z` (or `7zz` or `unzip`), and `git`.\n\nAuthors\n-------\n\n- Nils Adermann  | [GitHub](https://github.com/naderman)  | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/naderman) | <naderman@naderman.de> | [naderman.de](https://naderman.de)\n- Jordi Boggiano | [GitHub](https://github.com/Seldaek) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/seldaek) | <j.boggiano@seld.be> | [seld.be](https://seld.be)\n\nSee also the list of [contributors](https://github.com/composer/composer/contributors) who participated in this project.\n\nSecurity Reports\n----------------\n\nPlease send any sensitive issue to [security@packagist.org](mailto:security@packagist.org).
