    "problem": "Java and Maven were not installed on the Ubuntu system",

    "problem": "The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux",
    "solution": "The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.",

    "problem": "Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation",

    "problem": "Dependency resolution selected incompatible libc version",
    "solution": "The root cause was Cargo selecting a libc crate version requiring Rust 2021 edition, incompatible with Rust 1.36.0. The solution was to explicitly pin libc to version 0.2.54 in Cargo.toml, satisfying dependency constraints while maintaining compatibility.",

    "solution": "The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.",
