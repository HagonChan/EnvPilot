It contains important instructions for installation, usage, and project-specific details.  \n\n2. **Check Dependencies**  \n   Look for dependencies listed in the README or package management files like `CMakeLists.txt` (for CMake), `Makefile` (for Make), or `vcpkg.json` (for vcpkg). Ensure the required compiler and libraries are installed.  \n\n3. **Build Tool**  \n   Identify the build tool the project is using: Make, CMake, or another. This information should be available in the README or through project configuration files (e.g., `Makefile` for Make, `CMakeLists.txt` for CMake).  \n\n4. **Build the Project**  \n   Depending on the build tool, use the appropriate commands to build the project:  \n\n   - For Make:  \n     ```  \n     make  \n     ```  \n   - For CMake:  \n     ```  \n     mkdir build  \n     cd build  \n     cmake ..  \n     make  \n     ```  \n\n5. **Configuration**  \n   Check if the project requires configuration files (e.g., `.conf` files, `config.h` headers) to be set up. This may involve providing paths to dependencies or setting compilation flags.  \n\n6. **Run Tests (if available)**  \n   If the project provides tests, it's a good idea to run them to ensure everything is working correctly. Common testing frameworks for C/C++ include Google Test (gtest), Catch2, and Boost.Test.  \n   - For Google Test:  \n     ```  \n     ./path/to/test_executable  \n     ```  \n   - For Catch2:  \n     ```  \n     ./path/to/test_executable  \n     ```  \n\n7. **Run the Project**  \n   Follow the instructions in the README to run the project. This could involve running a specific executable, starting a server, or executing a specific command.  \n\n8. **Troubleshooting**  \n   If you encounter issues during installation or while running the project, refer to the project's issue tracker on GitHub or search for similar issues.  \n\n9. **Documentation**  \n   Review additional documentation such as Doxygen files, API documentation, or inline comments in the code. Understanding the documentation provides better insights into the project\u2019s structure and usage.  ",

We will soon fix this. Meantime, please\nuse JS demo.\n\nIf this number is lower than the [latest release's version\nnumber](https://github.com/google/libphonenumber/releases), we are between\nreleases and the demo may be at either version.\n\n### Demo App\n\nThere is a demo Android App called [E.164 Formatter](java/demoapp) in this\nrepository. The purpose of this App is to show an example of how the library can\nbe used in a real-life situation, in this case specifically in an Android App\nusing Java.\n\n## JavaScript\n\nThe [JavaScript\ndemo](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/google/libphonenumber/blob/master/javascript/i18n/phonenumbers/demo-compiled.html)\nmay be run at various tags; this link will take you to `master`.\n\n# Java code\n\nTo include the Java code in your application, either integrate with Maven (see\n[wiki](https://github.com/google/libphonenumber/wiki)) or download the latest\njars from the [Maven\nrepository](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/googlecode/libphonenumber/libphonenumber/).\n\n# Javadoc\n\nJavadoc is automatically updated to reflect the latest release at\nhttps://javadoc.io/doc/com.googlecode.libphonenumber/libphonenumber/.\n\n# Versioning and Announcements\n\nWe generally choose the release number following these guidelines.\n\nIf any of the changes pushed to master since the last release are incompatible\nwith the intent / specification of an existing libphonenumber API or may cause\nlibphonenumber (Java, C++, or JS) clients to have to change their code to keep\nbuilding, we publish a major release. For example, if the last release were\n7.7.3, the new one would be 8.0.0.\n\nIf any of those changes *enable* clients to update their code to take advantage\nof new functionality, and if clients would have to roll-back these changes in\nthe event that the release was marked as \"bad\", we publish a minor release. For\nexample, we'd go from 7.7.3 to 7.8.0.\n\nOtherwise, including when a release contains only\n[metadata](FAQ.md#metadata_definition) changes, we publish a sub-minor release,\ne.g. 7.7.3 to 7.7.4.\n\nSometimes we make internal changes to the code or metadata that, while not\naffecting compatibility for clients, could affect compatibility for **porters**\nof the library. For such changes we make announcements to\n[libphonenumber-discuss](\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/libphonenumber-discuss). Such changes\nare not reflected in the version number, and we would publish a sub-minor\nrelease if there were no other changes.\n\nWant to get notified of new releases? During most of the year, excepting\nholidays and extenuating circumstances, we release fortnightly. We update\n[release tags](https://github.com/google/libphonenumber/releases) and\ndocument detailed [release notes](\nhttps://github.com/google/libphonenumber/blob/master/release_notes.txt).\nWe also send an announcement to [libphonenumber-discuss](\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/libphonenumber-discuss) for every\nrelease.\n\n# Quick Examples\n\nLet's say you have a string representing a phone number from Switzerland. This\nis how you parse/normalize it into a `PhoneNumber` object:\n\n```java\nString swissNumberStr = \"044 668 18 00\";\nPhoneNumberUtil phoneUtil = PhoneNumberUtil.getInstance();\ntry {\n  PhoneNumber swissNumberProto = phoneUtil.parse(swissNumberStr, \"CH\");\n} catch (NumberParseException e) {\n  System.err.println(\"NumberParseException was thrown: \" + e.toString());\n}\n```\n\nAt this point, `swissNumberProto` contains:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"country_code\": 41,\n  \"national_number\": 446681800\n}\n```\n\n`PhoneNumber` is a class that was originally auto-generated from\n`phonenumber.proto` with necessary modifications for efficiency. For details on\nthe meaning of each field, refer to `resources/phonenumber.proto`.\n\nNow let us validate whether the number is valid:\n\n```java\nboolean isValid = phoneUtil.isValidNumber(swissNumberProto); // returns true\n```\n\nThere are a few formats supported by the formatting method, as illustrated\nbelow:\n\n```java\n// Produces \"+41 44 668 18 00\"\nSystem.out.println(phoneUtil.format(swissNumberProto, PhoneNumberFormat.INTERNATIONAL));\n// Produces \"044 668 18 00\"\nSystem.out.println(phoneUtil.format(swissNumberProto, PhoneNumberFormat.NATIONAL));\n// Produces \"+41446681800\"\nSystem.out.println(phoneUtil.format(swissNumberProto, PhoneNumberFormat.E164));\n```\n\nYou could also choose to format the number in the way it is dialed from another\ncountry:\n\n```java\n// Produces \"011 41 44 668 1800\", the number when it is dialed in the United States.\nSystem.out.println(phoneUtil.formatOutOfCountryCallingNumber(swissNumberProto, \"US\"));\n```\n\n## Formatting Phone Numbers 'as you type'\n\n```java\nPhoneNumberUtil phoneUtil = PhoneNumberUtil.getInstance();\nAsYouTypeFormatter formatter = phoneUtil.getAsYouTypeFormatter(\"US\");\nSystem.out.println(formatter.inputDigit('6'));  // Outputs \"6\"\n...  // Input more digits\nSystem.out.println(formatter.inputDigit('3'));  // Now outputs \"650 253\"\n```\n\n## Geocoding Phone Numbers\n\n```java\nPhoneNumberOfflineGeocoder geocoder = PhoneNumberOfflineGeocoder.getInstance();\n// Outputs \"Zurich\"\nSystem.out.println(geocoder.getDescriptionForNumber(swissNumberProto, Locale.ENGLISH));\n// Outputs \"Z\u00fcrich\"\nSystem.out.println(geocoder.getDescriptionForNumber(swissNumberProto, Locale.GERMAN));\n// Outputs \"Zurigo\"\nSystem.out.println(geocoder.getDescriptionForNumber(swissNumberProto, Locale.ITALIAN));\n```\n\n## Mapping Phone Numbers to original carriers\n\nCaveat: We do not provide data about the current carrier of a phone number, only\nthe original carrier who is assigned the corresponding range. Read about [number\nportability](FAQ.md#what-is-mobile-number-portability).\n\n```java\nPhoneNumber swissMobileNumber =\n    new PhoneNumber().setCountryCode(41).setNationalNumber(798765432L);\nPhoneNumberToCarrierMapper carrierMapper = PhoneNumberToCarrierMapper.getInstance();\n// Outputs \"Swisscom\"\nSystem.out.println(carrierMapper.getNameForNumber(swissMobileNumber, Locale.ENGLISH));\n```\n\nMore examples on how to use the library can be found in the [unit\ntests](https://github.com/google/libphonenumber/tree/master/java/libphonenumber/test/com/google/i18n/phonenumbers).\n\n# Third-party Ports\n\nSeveral third-party ports of the phone number library are known to us. We share\nthem here in case they're useful for developers.\n\nHowever, we emphasize that these ports are by developers outside the\nlibphonenumber project. We do not evaluate their quality or influence their\nmaintenance processes.\n\n*   C#: https://github.com/twcclegg/libphonenumber-csharp\n*   Gleam: https://github.com/massivefermion/phony\n*   Go: https://github.com/nyaruka/phonenumbers\n*   Objective-c: https://github.com/iziz/libPhoneNumber-iOS\n*   Swift: https://github.com/marmelroy/PhoneNumberKit\n*   PHP: https://github.com/giggsey/libphonenumber-for-php\n*   PostgreSQL in-database types: https://github.com/blm768/pg-libphonenumber\n*   Python: https://github.com/daviddrysdale/python-phonenumbers\n*   Ruby: https://github.com/ianks/mini_phone\n*   Ruby: https://github.com/daddyz/phonelib\n*   Ruby: https://github.com/mobi/telephone_number\n*   Rust: https://github.com/1aim/rust-phonenumber\n*   Erlang: https://github.com/marinakr/libphonenumber_erlang\n*   Clojure: https://github.com/randomseed-io/phone-number\n*   R: https://github.com/socialresearchcentre/dialr/\n*   Elixir: https://github.com/socialpaymentsbv/ex_phone_number\n*   Salesforce: https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3A00000G12oJUAR\n*   Dart: https://github.com/superakabo/dlibphonenumber\n  \nAlternatives to our own versions:\n\n*   Android-optimized: Our Java version loads the metadata from\n    `Class#getResourcesAsStream` and asks that Android apps follow the Android\n    loading best practices of repackaging the metadata and loading from\n    `AssetManager#open()` themselves\n    ([FAQ](https://github.com/google/libphonenumber/blob/master/FAQ.md#optimize-loads)).\n    If you don't want to do this, check out the port at\n    https://github.com/MichaelRocks/libphonenumber-android, which does repackage\n    the metadata and use `AssetManager#open()`, and may be depended on without\n    needing those specific loading optimizations from clients.
