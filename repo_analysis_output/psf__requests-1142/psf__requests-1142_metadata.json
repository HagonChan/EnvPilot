It usually contains important instructions for installation, usage, and any project-specific details. Some projects include a `Dockerfile` script, which you can review and reuse as needed.  \n\n2. **Check Dependencies**  \n   Look for dependencies listed in the README or in a `requirements.txt` file. Ensure you have the required versions of Python and any other libraries/packages.  \n\n3. **Virtual Environment**  \n   It\u2019s a good practice to create a virtual environment for each Python project to avoid conflicts with system-wide packages. Use the command:  \n   ```sh\n   python3.X -m venv .venv  \n   ```  \n\n4. **Configuration**  \n   Check if the project requires any configuration files (e.g., `.env` files) and set them up accordingly.  \n\n5. **Build the Project (rare cases)**  \n   Some projects might require building before usage, especially if they include C extensions or require compiling assets.  \n\n6. **Run Tests (if available)**  \n   If the project provides tests, it\u2019s a good idea to run them to ensure everything is working correctly. Some projects include a `tox.ini` file, which allows you to run tests with `tox`. Install `tox` first using:  \n   ```sh\n   pip install tox  \n   ```  \n\n7. **Run the Project**  \n   Follow the instructions in the README to run the project. This could involve running a script, starting a server, or executing a specific command.  \n\n8. **Troubleshooting**  \n   If you encounter issues during installation or while running the project, refer to the project\u2019s issue tracker on GitHub or search for similar issues others may have encountered.  \n\n9. **Test Suite Results**  \n   When running a test suite, it is normal for some test cases to fail. If the percentage of failing test cases is less than 20% of the total number, it is considered acceptable, and further investigation is not necessary.  \n\n10. **Shell Compatibility**  \n   In some shells, the `source` command may not work. In such cases, replace `source` with just `.` (a single dot). For example:  \n   ```sh\n   . .venv/bin/activate  \n   ```  \n\n11. **Avoid Using Conda**  \n   Instead of Conda, prefer the following commands to set up your virtual environment:  \n   ```sh\n   python -m venv .venv  \n   . .venv/bin/activate  \n   ```  ",

    "readme": "Requests: HTTP for Humans\n=========================\n\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/kennethreitz/requests.png?branch=master\n        :target: https://travis-ci.org/kennethreitz/requests\n\nRequests is an Apache2 Licensed HTTP library, written in Python, for human\nbeings.\n\nMost existing Python modules for sending HTTP requests are extremely\nverbose and cumbersome. Python's builtin urllib2 module provides most of\nthe HTTP capabilities you should need, but the api is thoroughly broken.\nIt requires an enormous amount of work (even method overrides) to\nperform the simplest of tasks.\n\nThings shouldn't be this way. Not in Python.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com', auth=('user', 'pass'))\n    >>> r.status_code\n    204\n    >>> r.headers['content-type']\n    'application/json'\n    >>> r.text\n    ...\n\nSee `the same code, without Requests <https://gist.github.com/973705>`_.\n\nRequests allow you to send HTTP/1.1 requests. You can add headers, form data,\nmultipart files, and parameters with simple Python dictionaries, and access the\nresponse data in the same way. It's powered by httplib and `urllib3\n<https://github.com/shazow/urllib3>`_, but it does all the hard work and crazy\nhacks for you.\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- International Domains and URLs\n- Keep-Alive & Connection Pooling\n- Sessions with Cookie Persistence\n- Browser-style SSL Verification\n- Basic/Digest Authentication\n- Elegant Key/Value Cookies\n- Automatic Decompression\n- Unicode Response Bodies\n- Multipart File Uploads\n- Connection Timeouts\n- Thread-safety\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo install requests, simply:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pip install requests\n\nOr, if you absolutely must:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ easy_install requests\n\nBut, you really shouldn't do that.\n\n\n\nContribute\n----------\n\n#. Check for open issues or open a fresh issue to start a discussion around a feature idea or a bug. There is a Contributor Friendly tag for issues that should be ideal for people who are not very familiar with the codebase yet.\n#. Fork `the repository`_ on Github to start making your changes to the **master** branch (or branch off of it).\n#. Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed or that the feature works as expected.\n#. Send a pull request and bug the maintainer until it gets merged and published. :) Make sure to add yourself to AUTHORS_.\n\n.. _`the repository`: http://github.com/kennethreitz/requests\n.. _AUTHORS: https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/AUTHORS.rst\n"
