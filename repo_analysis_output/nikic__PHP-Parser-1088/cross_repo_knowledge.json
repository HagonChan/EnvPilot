  {
    "problem": "The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux",
    "solution": "The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.",
    "action": "apk add cmake g++ make"
  },
  {
    "problem": "The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies",
    "solution": "The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.",
    "action": "apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm"
  },
  {
    "problem": "The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment",
    "solution": "The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.",
    "action": "cargo test"
  },
  {
    "problem": "Dependency lock file incompatibility with the older toolchain",
    "solution": "The `Cargo.lock` file was generated by a newer version of Cargo and was incompatible with the older Rust toolchain (1.26.0). The root cause was a version mismatch in the lock file serialization format. The solution was to remove the lock file to allow Cargo to regenerate it with a compatible format for the toolchain.",
    "action": "rm -f Cargo.lock"
  },
  {
    "problem": "Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment",
    "solution": "The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.",

  {
    "problem": "Dependency installation failed when cloning a Git repository",
    "solution": "The Git protocol (git://) was blocked or unsupported in the environment, causing connection timeouts during repository cloning. The root cause was network configuration restrictions. The solution was to modify the dependency URL to use HTTPS protocol instead.",
    "action": "sed -i 's|git://github.com|https://github.com|g' requirements/dev.txt"
  },
  {
    "problem": "The initial apt-get update command failed due to missing HTTPS transport support",
    "solution": "The system lacked the apt-transport-https package required for accessing HTTPS repositories during package updates. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for secure repository access. The solution was to install apt-transport-https using apt-get install apt-transport-https, which enabled successful HTTPS connections for subsequent package operations.",
    "action": "apt-get install apt-transport-https"
  },
  {
    "problem": "A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions",
    "solution": "The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.",
    "action": "npm install --legacy-peer-deps"
  },
  {
    "problem": "Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests",
    "solution": "The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.",
    "action": "apt-get install -y python3"
  },
  {
    "problem": "The curl command was not available for downloading dependencies",

  },
  {
    "problem": "The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.",
    "solution": "The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.",
    "action": "apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -"

  {
    "problem": "Dependency resolution selected incompatible libc version",
    "solution": "The root cause was Cargo selecting a libc crate version requiring Rust 2021 edition, incompatible with Rust 1.36.0. The solution was to explicitly pin libc to version 0.2.54 in Cargo.toml, satisfying dependency constraints while maintaining compatibility.",
    "action": "sed -i '/byteorder = \"=1.0.0\"/a libc = \"=0.2.54\"' Cargo.toml"

    "problem": "The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.",
    "solution": "The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.",
