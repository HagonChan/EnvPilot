    "problem": "The Go toolchain was not installed on the system",
    "solution": "The root cause was a missing Go installation required for building and testing the Go project. The solution involved updating the package index and installing Go using the system package manager (apt-get).

    "problem": "The installed Go version was outdated and incompatible with module-based builds",
    "solution": "The root cause was that the default package repository provided an older Go version (1.11) which lacked full support for Go modules, resulting in 'cannot use modules with build cache disabled' errors. The solution was to manually download and install a compatible version (1.13.15) from the official source, followed by updating the PATH to prioritize the new installation.",

    "solution": "The root cause was that the initial environment setup did not include all necessary Go dependencies for the project. When running 'go test -race ./...', the system attempted to download missing packages but encountered failures. This occurred because the Ubuntu environment lacked the required dependencies for building the project from source. The solution was to install the missing dependencies using 'go get' before running tests, ensuring the environment had all necessary packages.",
