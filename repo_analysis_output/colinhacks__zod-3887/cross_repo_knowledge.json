    "problem": "Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution",
    "solution": "The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.",

  },
  {
    "problem": "The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation",
    "solution": "The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.",

    "problem": "Essential system build tools were missing, causing compilation failures for native dependencies",
    "solution": "The root cause was the lack of core development packages such as compilers, libraries, and configuration tools, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates with native code. This led to errors during the build process. The solution was to install the required build dependencies using the system package manager.",

    "problem": "The system package manager command to install Node.js and npm timed out due to execution limits",

  {
    "problem": "The initial npm installation via the system package manager timed out due to slow execution.",
    "solution": "The root cause was the apt-get command taking longer than the environment's 180-second timeout limit, likely due to network latency or large package downloads. The solution was to bypass the package manager and install npm directly using an official installation script, ensuring compatibility and faster execution.",

    "solution": "The root cause was an incompatibility between the installed version of rollup-plugin-typescript2 and the Node.js environment, leading to a module resolution error where required subpaths were not exported. This occurred because the default package version was not compatible with the Node.js version. The solution was to install a specific compatible version of the package to resolve the export issue.",

    "solution": "The root cause was that the apt-get command exceeded the allowed execution limit, likely due to network latency or repository issues, but it was unnecessary because Node.js and npm were already installed in the environment. The solution was to verify the existing installations by checking their versions, confirming that the installation step could be skipped.",

The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.",

    "problem": "Essential build tools were missing on the Ubuntu system, potentially required for compiling dependencies",
    "solution": "The build-essential package, which includes compilers and build tools like gcc and make, was not installed in the Ubuntu environment. The root cause was an incomplete system package configuration. The solution was to update the local package index and install build-essential to provide the necessary tools for any compilation steps during environment setup.",

  {
    "problem": "Offline build failures due to missing cached dependencies",
    "solution": "The root cause was the absence of pre-downloaded dependencies in the local cache, making offline builds impossible.

The solution was to execute cargo commands with --offline, but it was ineffective as no dependencies were cached.",
