    "problem": "Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency",

  {
    "problem": "Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures",
    "solution": "The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.",

  {
    "problem": "pip was not available for Python 3.11 after installation",
    "solution": "The Python 3.11 installation lacked pip due to Debian/Ubuntu's disabled ensurepip. This prevented dependency installation. The solution was to install the system-wide python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.",

  },
  {
    "problem": "Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies",
    "solution": "The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.",

    "problem": "The initial test command failed because Python 3 and pip were not installed in the environment.",
    "solution": "The root cause was a missing Python runtime and package manager in the Ubuntu system, which are essential for installing dependencies and running Python-based projects. Without these, pip-based installations and pytest executions failed. The solution was to install Python 3 and pip using the system package manager after updating the package index.",

    "problem": "Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.",

    "solution": "The root cause was a lock file generated by a newer Cargo version being incompatible with an older toolchain. This occurred when switching to a historical nightly toolchain after previous builds used modern toolchains. The solution was to remove the lock file to allow Cargo to regenerate it in a format compatible with the target toolchain.",

  {
    "problem": "Python3 was missing during the build process",
