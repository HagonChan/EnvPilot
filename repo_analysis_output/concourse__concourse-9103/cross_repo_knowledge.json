    "solution": "The root cause was that the default package repository provided an older Go version (1.11) which lacked full support for Go modules, resulting in 'cannot use modules with build cache disabled' errors. The solution was to manually download and install a compatible version (1.13.15) from the official source, followed by updating the PATH to prioritize the new installation.",

This environment configuration issue prevented tool installation.

    "solution": "After installing Go, the GOPATH and PATH environment variables were not configured, preventing Go from locating the module cache and binaries. The root cause was incomplete environment setup post-installation, common in minimal or containerized environments.

    "solution": "The root cause was that the initial environment setup did not include all necessary Go dependencies for the project. When running 'go test -race ./...', the system attempted to download missing packages but encountered failures. This occurred because the Ubuntu environment lacked the required dependencies for building the project from source. The solution was to install the missing dependencies using 'go get' before running tests, ensuring the environment had all necessary packages.",
