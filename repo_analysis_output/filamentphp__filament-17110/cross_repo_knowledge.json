    "problem": "The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment",
    "solution": "The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.",
    "action": "cargo test"
  },
  {
    "problem": "The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux",
    "solution": "The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.",

  },
  {
    "problem": "Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures",
    "solution": "The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.",

    "problem": "The pytest command was not found when running the test suite",
    "solution": "The required Python test dependencies, including pytest, were not installed in the environment. The root cause was missing package installations specified in test-requirements.txt. The solution was to install all dependencies using pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt.",

  },
  {
    "problem": "Dependency lock file incompatibility with the older toolchain",
    "solution": "The `Cargo.lock` file was generated by a newer version of Cargo and was incompatible with the older Rust toolchain (1.26.0). The root cause was a version mismatch in the lock file serialization format. The solution was to remove the lock file to allow Cargo to regenerate it with a compatible format for the toolchain.",
    "action": "rm -f Cargo.lock"
  },
  {
    "problem": "Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories",
    "solution": "The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.",

  {
    "problem": "The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.",
    "solution": "The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.",

  {
    "problem": "Essential system build tools were missing, causing compilation failures for native dependencies",
    "solution": "The root cause was the lack of core development packages such as compilers, libraries, and configuration tools, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates with native code. This led to errors during the build process. The solution was to install the required build dependencies using the system package manager.",

    "problem": "Test execution times out due to missing browser dependencies for Puppeteer-based testing",
    "solution": "The test framework relies on Puppeteer for end-to-end testing, which requires a browser environment like Chromium. On Ubuntu systems, Puppeteer cannot launch a browser without the necessary system packages, causing tests to hang indefinitely. The root cause is the absence of Chromium and its dependencies in the environment configuration. The solution is to install Chromium using the system package manager to enable browser automation.",
    "action": "apt-get install -y chromium-browser"
  },
  {
    "problem": "Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies",
    "solution": "The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.",

    "problem": "The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation",
    "solution": "The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.",
    "action": "nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3"

  {
    "problem": "The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing",
    "solution": "The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.",

    "solution": "The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.",

  {
    "problem": "The browser-based test command timed out due to lack of headless browser support in the container environment.",
    "solution": "The root cause was the Docker container environment not having a headless browser installed or configured, which is essential for running Karma-based tests that require browser rendering. This led to command cancellation after exceeding time limits. The solution was to install a headless browser like Chromium to enable test execution in headless environments.",

    "problem": "Build failure due to outdated Go version incompatible with project dependencies",
    "solution": "The installed Go version (1.11.13) was too old and lacked required packages like log/slog, causing module resolution failures. The root cause was an incompatible runtime environment. The solution was to install a compatible Go version (1.21.0) via direct download and update the PATH to include it.",
    "action": "wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin"
