    "problem": "The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment",
    "solution": "The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.",

    "problem": "Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation",

    "problem": "Dependency resolution selected incompatible crate versions",
    "solution": "The root cause was Cargo resolving crate versions requiring features (e.g., Rust 2021 edition) unsupported in the target toolchain (Rust 1.36.0). The solution involved pinning each problematic dependency to a compatible version in Cargo.toml using exact version constraints.",

The solution was to remove the lock file to allow Cargo to regenerate it in a format compatible with the target toolchain.",
