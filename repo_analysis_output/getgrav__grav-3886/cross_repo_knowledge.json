    "problem": "The initial apt-get update command failed due to missing HTTPS transport support",
    "solution": "The system lacked the apt-transport-https package required for accessing HTTPS repositories during package updates. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for secure repository access. The solution was to install apt-transport-https using apt-get install apt-transport-https, which enabled successful HTTPS connections for subsequent package operations.",
    "action": "apt-get install apt-transport-https"

  {
    "problem": "Essential system build tools were missing, causing compilation failures for native dependencies",
    "solution": "The root cause was the lack of core development packages such as compilers, libraries, and configuration tools, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates with native code. This led to errors during the build process. The solution was to install the required build dependencies using the system package manager.",

  {
    "problem": "Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.",
    "solution": "System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.",

  {
    "problem": "The browser-based test command timed out due to lack of headless browser support in the container environment.",
    "solution": "The root cause was the Docker container environment not having a headless browser installed or configured, which is essential for running Karma-based tests that require browser rendering. This led to command cancellation after exceeding time limits. The solution was to install a headless browser like Chromium to enable test execution in headless environments.",

  },
  {
    "problem": "Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies",
    "solution": "The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.",

    "problem": "The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment",
    "solution": "The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.",

  {
    "problem": "The initial dependency installation command timed out due to lockfile constraints",
    "solution": "The first attempt to install dependencies with pnpm timed out, likely due to the frozen lockfile preventing updates or network issues. The root cause was the lockfile configuration causing the installation to stall. The solution was to use the --no-frozen-lockfile flag to allow lockfile updates, which resolved the timeout.",
    "action": "pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile"

  {
    "problem": "The test command file was missing at the required path during environment setup",
    "solution": "The root cause was an incorrect path specification when creating the test command file, leading to the file not being found by the submission command. The solution was to create the file at the correct absolute path using the echo command to ensure the test command is accessible.",

    "problem": "Dependency lock file incompatibility with the older toolchain",
    "solution": "The `Cargo.lock` file was generated by a newer version of Cargo and was incompatible with the older Rust toolchain (1.26.0). The root cause was a version mismatch in the lock file serialization format. The solution was to remove the lock file to allow Cargo to regenerate it with a compatible format for the toolchain.",

  {
    "problem": "The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux",
    "solution": "The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.",

  {
    "problem": "Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures",
    "solution": "The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.",
