# General Guidelines:
**General Guidelines for PHP Projects**

1. **Read the README**  
   Start by reading the project's README file on GitHub. It often contains important instructions for installation, usage, PHP version requirements, and any project-specific details.  

2. **Check Dependencies**  
   Look for dependencies listed in the README or in the `composer.json` file. Ensure you have the required PHP version and any extensions installed. Check for system requirements and PHP modules needed.  

3. **PHP Installation**  
   Ensure you have PHP installed with the required version. Verify installation:  
   ```sh
   php --version  
   ```  
   For Ubuntu/Debian systems, you can install PHP:  
   ```sh
   sudo apt update  
   sudo apt install php php-cli php-common  
   ```  

4. **Composer Installation**  
   Most modern PHP projects use Composer for dependency management. Install Composer if not already available:  
   ```sh
   curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php  
   sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer  
   ```  
   Verify installation:  
   ```sh
   composer --version  
   ```  

5. **Install Dependencies**  
   Use Composer to install project dependencies:  
   ```sh
   composer install  
   ```  
   For production environment:  
   ```sh
   composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader  
   ```  

6. **Autoloading**  
   Ensure the autoloader is properly set up. Most projects using Composer will have:  
   ```php
   require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';  
   ```  

7. **Configuration**  
   Check if the project requires any configuration files (e.g., `.env` files, `config.php`, database configuration) and set them up accordingly. Look for example configuration files like `.env.example`.  

8. **Database Setup**  
   If the project uses a database, set up the database connection and run any migrations:  
   ```sh
   php artisan migrate  # For Laravel projects  
   ```  
   Or check for SQL files in the project that need to be imported.  

9. **Web Server Setup**  
   For web applications, you can use PHP's built-in server for development:  
   ```sh
   php -S localhost:8000  
   ```  
   Or for specific document root:  
   ```sh
   php -S localhost:8000 -t public/  
   ```  
   For production, configure Apache/Nginx as described in the project documentation.  

10. **Run Tests (if available)**  
    If the project provides tests, run them to ensure everything is working correctly. Common test commands include:  
    ```sh
    ./vendor/bin/phpunit  
    ```  
    Or if using Composer scripts:  
    ```sh
    composer test  
    ```  

11. **Code Quality Tools**  
    Use code quality tools if available in the project:  
    - PHP CodeSniffer for coding standards:  
      ```sh
      ./vendor/bin/phpcs  
      ```  
    - PHP Stan for static analysis:  
      ```sh
      ./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse  
      ```  
    - PHP CS Fixer for code formatting:  
      ```sh
      ./vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix  
      ```  

12. **Run the Project**  
    Follow the instructions in the README to run the project. This could involve:  
    - Starting a web server  
    - Running specific PHP scripts  
    - Using framework-specific commands (e.g., `php artisan serve` for Laravel)  

13. **Common PHP Extensions**  
    Install commonly required PHP extensions if missing:  
    ```sh
    sudo apt install php-mysql php-pgsql php-sqlite3 php-curl php-json php-mbstring php-xml php-zip  
    ```  

14. **Memory and Execution Limits**  
    Some projects may require adjusting PHP settings. Check `php.ini` for:  
    - `memory_limit`  
    - `max_execution_time`  
    - `upload_max_filesize`  

15. **Troubleshooting**  
    If you encounter issues during installation or while running the project:  
    - Check PHP error logs  
    - Verify all required PHP extensions are installed  
    - Ensure proper file permissions  
    - Refer to the project's issue tracker on GitHub  

16. **Test Suite Results**  
    When running a test suite, it is normal for some test cases to fail. If the percentage of failing test cases is less than 20% of the total number, it is considered acceptable, and further investigation is usually not necessary.  

17. **Framework-Specific Commands**  
    Be aware of framework-specific tools and commands:  
    - Laravel: `php artisan`  
    - Symfony: `php bin/console`  
    - CakePHP: `bin/cake`  
    - CodeIgniter: framework-specific setup instructions
