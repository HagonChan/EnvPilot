# General Guidelines:

**General Guidelines for Go Projects**

1. **Read the README**  
   Start by reading the project's README file on GitHub. It often contains important instructions for installation, usage, and any project-specific details, including Go version requirements.

2. **Check Dependencies**  
   Look for dependencies listed in the README or in the `go.mod` file. Ensure you have the required Go version installed. Check the `go` directive in `go.mod` for version requirements.

3. **Go Installation**  
   Ensure you have Go installed. Download from https://golang.org/dl/ if needed. Verify installation:

    ```sh
    go version
    ```

4. **Module Management**  
   If the project uses Go modules (most modern projects do), the `go.mod` file manages dependencies. Download dependencies:

    ```sh
    go mod download
    ```

    Tidy up dependencies:

    ```sh
    go mod tidy
    ```

5. **Build the Project**  
   Use Go to build the project:

    ```sh
    go build
    ```

    For specific packages:

    ```sh
    go build ./cmd/package_name
    ```

    For cross-compilation:

    ```sh
    GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build
    ```

6. **Configuration**  
   Check if the project requires any configuration files (e.g., `.env` files, YAML/JSON config files) and set them up accordingly. Some projects may use environment variables for configuration.

7. **Run Tests (if available)**  
   If the project provides tests, run them to ensure everything is working correctly:

    ```sh
    go test ./...
    ```

    For verbose output:

    ```sh
    go test -v ./...
    ```

    For coverage:

    ```sh
    go test -cover ./...
    ```

8. **Run the Project**  
   Follow the instructions in the README to run the project. Common commands include:

    ```sh
    go run main.go
    ```

    For specific packages:

    ```sh
    go run ./cmd/package_name
    ```

9. **Code Quality**  
   Use Go's built-in tools for code quality:

    - Format code:
        ```sh
        go fmt ./...
        ```
    - Vet code for potential issues:
        ```sh
        go vet ./...
        ```
    - Use golint if available:
        ```sh
        golint ./...
        ```

10. **Vendor Dependencies (if used)**  
    Some projects might use vendored dependencies:

    ```sh
    go mod vendor
    ```

11. **Documentation**  
    Generate documentation:

    ```sh
    go doc package_name
    ```

    Or use godoc for local server:

    ```sh
    godoc -http=:6060
    ```

12. **Troubleshooting**  
    If you encounter issues during installation or while running the project, refer to the project's issue tracker on GitHub or search for similar issues. Check Go's error messages carefully as they are usually descriptive.

13. **Test Suite Results**  
    When running a test suite, it is normal for some test cases to fail. If the percentage of failing test cases is less than 20% of the total number, it is considered acceptable, and further investigation is usually not necessary.

14. **Environment Setup**  
    Set up Go environment variables if needed:
    ```sh
    export GOPATH=$HOME/go
    export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
    ```
    Note: GOPATH is less important with Go modules but may still be needed for some legacy projects.
