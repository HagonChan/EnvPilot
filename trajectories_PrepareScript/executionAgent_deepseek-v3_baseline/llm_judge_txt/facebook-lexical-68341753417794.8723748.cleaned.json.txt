FAILED
Detailed reasoning:
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): Failed - The output shows an empty "ExecutionAgent_attempt" array, indicating no test suite was executed at all. There is no evidence of any test suite starting, executing, or finishing successfully. No test report structure was generated.

2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): Failed - With no execution attempts recorded, there is no evidence that core functional modules can be imported or used normally. No API calls were made and no example code was executed to demonstrate core features.

The agent appears to have made no meaningful progress in configuring the environment, as evidenced by the complete lack of execution attempts. Both critical success criteria were not met.
