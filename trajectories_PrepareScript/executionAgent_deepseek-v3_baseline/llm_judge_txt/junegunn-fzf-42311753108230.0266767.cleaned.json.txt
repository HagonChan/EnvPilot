FAILED

1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):
- The test suite execution failed to complete successfully. The test runner (`ruby test/runner.rb`) encountered repeated errors related to tmux session management ("error connecting to /tmp/tmux-0/default (No such file or directory)"). 
- Multiple attempts to run the tests resulted in hanging processes that had to be terminated, indicating the test framework could not execute normally.
- While the test suite started (showing "Run options: --seed 53454"), it did not produce a complete test report structure due to the tmux-related failures.

2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):
- The core functionality could not be properly verified because the test environment setup was incomplete. 
- While the fzf installation completed successfully ("make install && ./install --all" worked), we couldn't verify core functionality through test execution.
- The Docker environment was successfully built and dependencies were installed (including Ruby gems), but the tmux dependency for testing was not properly configured.

The environment configuration fails both success criteria because:
1. No test suite could complete execution due to tmux-related errors
2. Core functionality could not be verified through test execution
3. The agent exhausted its attempts without resolving the fundamental tmux configuration issue
