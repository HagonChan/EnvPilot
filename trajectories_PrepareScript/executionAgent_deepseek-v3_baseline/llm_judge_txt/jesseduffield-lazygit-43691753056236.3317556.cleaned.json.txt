FAILED

Detailed reasoning:
1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):
- The agent attempted to run tests with `go test ./...` but encountered multiple failures:
  - Initial failure due to Go version mismatch (required 1.24.0 but had 1.22.12)
  - After version correction, encountered build failures in internal/abi package
  - Subsequent attempts revealed dependency resolution issues with multiple packages (generics, go-git/v5, gocui, lazycore)
  - The test suite never completed successfully due to these unresolved dependency issues

2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):
- The agent was unable to properly install all required dependencies due to version conflicts and unknown revisions
- Core modules couldn't be imported successfully as evidenced by the dependency resolution failures
- No successful demonstration of basic API calls or core features was achieved

Key failure points:
- Multiple dependency resolution failures prevented proper environment setup
- Test suite couldn't complete due to build errors
- Core functionality couldn't be verified due to dependency issues
- Agent exhausted maximum attempts without achieving basic functionality

The environment configuration did not meet either of the two success criteria, resulting in a FAILED evaluation.
