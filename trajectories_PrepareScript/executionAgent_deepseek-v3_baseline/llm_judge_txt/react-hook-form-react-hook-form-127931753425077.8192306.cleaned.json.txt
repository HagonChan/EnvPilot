FAILED

1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**: The agent was unable to successfully start a Docker container to execute the test suite. Multiple attempts to create and run a Docker container failed with the error "failed to start container for image react-hook-form-react-hook-form-12793_image:executionagent". Without a running container, the test suite (`npm test`) could not be executed, and no test report was generated. This directly violates the first success criterion.

2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**: Similarly, the inability to start a container prevented any verification of core functionality. The agent could not import or test any modules, make API calls, or execute example code. The environment was never properly configured to a state where basic functionality could be verified, failing the second success criterion.

Additional Notes:
- The Docker setup appears to be the critical failure point, but the exact cause remains unclear (could be system permissions, Docker configuration, or other issues).
- The agent exhausted its attempts to configure the environment without achieving either success condition.
- No test suite execution or core functionality verification was possible due to the containerization failure.
