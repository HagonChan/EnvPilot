FAILED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The agent was unable to execute any test suite. The Docker container setup failed ("failed to start container for image"), preventing any test execution. No test reports were generated.
2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The core functionality could not be verified as the environment setup failed at the Docker container stage. The npm installation and build process never completed successfully, so core modules were never properly installed or tested.
3. The agent hit a critical failure point when the Docker container wouldn't start, which prevented any further progress in the environment configuration process. Without a working container, neither testing nor core functionality verification could be performed.
