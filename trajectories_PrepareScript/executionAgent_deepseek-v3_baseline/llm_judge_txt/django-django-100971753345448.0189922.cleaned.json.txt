FAILED

Detailed Reasoning:

1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):
- The agent attempted to run the test suite multiple times with different Django versions (3.2, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 5.0) but consistently encountered ImportError for 'RemovedInDjango61Warning' and 'get_max_test_processes'
- The test suite never completed successfully - it failed to even start due to version compatibility issues
- No test report structure was generated as the test runner couldn't initialize

2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):
- While Django was successfully installed in various versions, core functionality couldn't be verified
- The agent didn't demonstrate any successful imports of Django modules or execution of basic API calls
- The persistent import errors suggest fundamental incompatibility between the installed Django versions and the test suite requirements

Key Failure Points:
- Version mismatch between the Python environment (3.10.18) and Django requirements (>=3.12 according to pyproject.toml)
- The test suite appears to require features from Django 6.1+ (RemovedInDjango61Warning) but this version wasn't properly installed
- The agent cycled through multiple Django versions without resolving the core compatibility issue
- No successful test execution or core functionality demonstration was achieved

The environment configuration failed to meet either of the two success criteria, primarily due to unresolved version compatibility issues that prevented both test execution and core functionality verification.
