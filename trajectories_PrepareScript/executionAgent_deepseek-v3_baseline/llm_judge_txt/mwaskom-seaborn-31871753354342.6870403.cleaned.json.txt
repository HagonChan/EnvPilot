PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The test suite successfully executed with 2364 tests passing, 11 skipped, and 6 expected failures (xfailed) out of 2381 total tests. The test framework generated a complete coverage report showing 98% overall coverage, meeting the requirement that at least one complete test suite must execute and finish successfully.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The seaborn package was successfully imported and its version (0.14.0.dev0) was printed, demonstrating that core modules can be imported and used normally. The extensive test suite execution further confirms that basic API calls and core features are functioning as expected.

The environment configuration meets both success criteria despite some test skips and expected failures, which are considered non-critical as they don't prevent the test suite from completing or core functionality from working. The high test coverage percentage (98%) and successful test execution demonstrate a properly configured environment.
