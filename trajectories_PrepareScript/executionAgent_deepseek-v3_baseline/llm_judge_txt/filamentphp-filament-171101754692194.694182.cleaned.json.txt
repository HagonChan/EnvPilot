FAILED

1. Test Suite Execution: The agent was unable to execute any test suite successfully. While the Docker container was created and basic PHP environment was set up, the agent couldn't install Composer dependencies or run the Pest test suite due to restrictions on Docker command execution after container creation. No test execution was demonstrated.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The agent couldn't verify any core functionality. The PHP environment was partially set up (PHP 8.1 with some extensions), but the critical step of installing project dependencies via Composer was never successfully completed. Without dependencies installed, core modules couldn't be imported or tested.

The environment configuration failed because:
- No test suite could be executed (Condition 1 not met)
- Core functionality couldn't be verified due to missing dependencies (Condition 2 not met)
- The agent hit operational limitations with Docker command restrictions
- The maximum call limit was reached without achieving basic functionality

The setup process was incomplete as it couldn't progress beyond the initial container creation and basic PHP installation. The critical steps of dependency installation and test execution were never successfully completed.
