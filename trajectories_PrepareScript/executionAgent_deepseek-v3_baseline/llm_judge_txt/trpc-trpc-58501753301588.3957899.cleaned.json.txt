FAILED
Detailed reasoning:
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): Failed - The ExecutionAgent_attempt array is empty, indicating no test suite was even attempted to be executed. There is no evidence of any test suite starting, executing or finishing successfully.
2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): Failed - With no execution attempts recorded, there is no evidence that core modules can be imported or used normally, nor any demonstration of basic API functionality.
3. Overall: The complete lack of execution attempts means neither of the two success criteria were met. The agent didn't progress far enough to even attempt basic verification of the environment configuration.
