FAILED

Detailed Reasoning:

1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):
- The agent was unable to successfully execute any test suite. While the project was built successfully and test targets were identified (via `cmake --build . --target tests`), the `ctest` command consistently reported "No tests were found!!!".
- The test framework did not generate any test report structure, as no tests were discovered or executed.
- Multiple attempts to configure and run tests (including with `-DBUILD_TESTING=ON` and `--verbose` flags) were unsuccessful.

2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):
- While the project was successfully built (CMake configuration and make completed), there's no evidence that core functional modules were imported or used.
- No example code execution or API verification was demonstrated in the trajectory.
- The build process completed, but without test execution or functional verification, we cannot confirm core functionality works as expected.

Additional Observations:
- The environment was properly configured with all necessary dependencies (CMake, g++, etc.)
- The project was successfully built from source
- Test-related files were found in the codebase, but the testing framework failed to recognize/execute them
- The agent exhausted multiple approaches to run tests without success

Since neither of the two required success conditions was fully met (no test suite executed successfully and no core functionality verification), the environment configuration must be considered unsuccessful.
