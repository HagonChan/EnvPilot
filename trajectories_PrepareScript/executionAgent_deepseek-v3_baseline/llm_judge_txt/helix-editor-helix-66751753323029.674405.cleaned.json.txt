PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The output shows that multiple test suites completed successfully. While there were initial linker errors (likely due to resource constraints), running the tests with `--test-threads=1` resulted in all tests passing. The test framework generated complete reports showing 156 tests passed across various crates, with detailed timing information for each test suite.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The successful compilation and test execution demonstrate that core modules can be imported and used normally. The project built successfully with `cargo install`, and all test suites for core components (helix-core, helix-view, etc.) passed, indicating basic API functionality is working as expected. The Docker environment was properly configured with all necessary dependencies.

The initial resource-related test failures were resolved by adjusting test execution parameters, and the subsequent successful test run meets both success criteria. The environment is properly configured for development and testing of the helix editor.
