FAILED
1. Test Suite Execution: The agent was unable to successfully execute any test suite for the matplotlib project. The Docker container was built but the installation of matplotlib in editable mode ('pip install -e .') consistently failed, preventing any test execution. The setup.py file indicates tests should be run with pytest, but this step was never reached.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The core matplotlib package could not be successfully installed in the environment, as evidenced by repeated failures of the 'pip install -e .' command. Without successful installation, core functionality verification was impossible. The agent couldn't verify basic imports or API functionality.

The environment configuration failed because:
- The Docker container setup didn't complete successfully (installation step failed)
- No test suite could be executed
- Core package functionality couldn't be verified due to installation failures
- The agent exhausted its attempts without achieving either success condition

The main obstacles were:
1. Inability to properly install matplotlib in the Docker container
2. Restrictions preventing direct Docker command execution for debugging
3. Repeated failures in the editable installation mode
4. No successful verification of either test execution or core functionality
