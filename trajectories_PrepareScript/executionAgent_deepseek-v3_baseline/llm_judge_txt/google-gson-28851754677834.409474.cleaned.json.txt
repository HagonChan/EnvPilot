PASSED

1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):**  
   - The command `mvn clean verify` executed successfully, completing the build process and running all tests across multiple modules (Gson Parent, Gson, Gson Extras, etc.).  
   - Test results show **0 failures/errors** (e.g., `Tests run: 40, Failures: 0, Errors: 0` in Gson Extras module).  
   - Maven generated a full test report structure (visible in the truncated output), confirming the test suite completed.  

2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):**  
   - The build success implies core modules (e.g., `gson`, `gson-extras`) compiled without errors.  
   - Test cases (e.g., `RuntimeTypeAdapterFactoryTest`, `InterceptorTest`) executed successfully, demonstrating core functionality works.  
   - No import errors or critical failures were reported during the build or test phases.  

**Key Evidence:**  
- Reactor Summary shows `BUILD SUCCESS` for all modules.  
- Tests passed in all modules (e.g., `Gson Extras: Tests run: 40, Failures: 0`).  
- The agent documented reproducible setup steps (`SETUP_AND_INSTALL.sh`) and test results (`TEST_RESULTS.txt`).  

**Note:** Non-critical issues (e.g., initial missing `pom.xml`) were resolved by the agent through Dockerfile creation and repository cloning, enabling the final successful execution.
