FAILED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The agent did not reach the stage of executing any test suites. The process was interrupted during environment setup when trying to install CMake 3.28.0, which is required for building the project. Without completing the build process, no test suites could be executed.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The agent successfully installed Python dependencies (after version adjustments) but failed to complete the CMake installation and configuration. Since the build system wasn't properly set up, core functionality verification couldn't be performed. The project requires CMake 3.28+ for building, and while the agent made progress in setting up the environment, it didn't reach the point where core modules could be imported or basic API calls could be tested.

The environment configuration failed because:
- The build system requirements weren't fully met (CMake 3.28+ installation wasn't completed)
- No test suites were executed
- Core functionality wasn't verified
- The agent didn't demonstrate that either of the two success criteria were met

The process was interrupted during the critical build system setup phase, preventing any further verification of the environment's functionality.
