FAILED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The agent was unable to successfully execute any test suite. The build process failed due to Go version incompatibility (project requires >=1.23.0 while the container had 1.21.13). Even after attempting to upgrade Go, the build still failed. No test suite was able to start or complete.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The agent was unable to verify any core functionality. The project couldn't be built due to the version mismatch, so no modules could be imported or tested. The fundamental build step failed before any functionality could be verified.

The environment configuration failed because:
- The Docker container couldn't meet the Go version requirements
- The build process failed before any tests could run
- No core functionality could be verified due to the build failure
- The agent exhausted its attempts to resolve the version conflict without success

Both success criteria were not met, resulting in a FAILED evaluation. The primary blocker was the Go version requirement that couldn't be satisfied in the container environment.
