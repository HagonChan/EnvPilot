FAILED

1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**: 
- The agent attempted to build and test the project using a Docker container but failed during the Maven build step (`./mvnw clean install` returned non-zero exit code 1)
- No evidence of any test suite being executed successfully
- The build failure prevents any test execution from occurring

2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**:
- The project's main modules were never successfully built or imported
- No demonstration of core functionality working (API calls, module imports, etc.)
- The Docker build failures prevented any verification of core features

Key failure points:
- Multiple Docker build attempts failed (both base image fetch and Maven build)
- No successful execution of either test suites or core functionality verification
- The environment was never properly configured to a state where basic operations could be tested

The agent was unable to establish a working environment where either testing or core functionality could be verified, thus failing both success criteria.
