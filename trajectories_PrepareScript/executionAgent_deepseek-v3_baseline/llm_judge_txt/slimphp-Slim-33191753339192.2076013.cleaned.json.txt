PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The test suite executed successfully with all 432 tests passing (819 assertions). PHPUnit completed the test run without errors, and static analysis tools (PHPStan and Psalm) also ran successfully, though they identified some code quality issues that don't affect test outcomes.
2. Core Functionality Verification: The environment was properly configured with all dependencies installed (via composer install), and the test suite completion demonstrates that core functionality is working as expected. The project's main components were able to be imported and tested successfully.
3. While there were initial setup challenges with missing zip/unzip packages, these were resolved and didn't prevent the successful execution of tests. The code quality issues identified by static analysis are non-critical and don't affect the basic functionality.
