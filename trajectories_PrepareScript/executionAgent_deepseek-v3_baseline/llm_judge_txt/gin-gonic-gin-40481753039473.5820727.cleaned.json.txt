1. Test Suite Execution: The final `go test ./...` command shows multiple test suites completing successfully with "ok" status (e.g., github.com/gin-gonic/gin, github.com/gin-gonic/gin/binding). While some packages had no test files, this doesn't constitute a test suite failure. The framework generated proper test reports for all testable packages.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The successful test runs across multiple core packages (gin, binding, render, etc.) demonstrate that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally. The test execution itself verifies basic API functionality as the tests would fail if core features were broken.

The initial Go version mismatch was resolved through proper container configuration, and subsequent dependency management (`go mod tidy`) worked correctly. While there were initial setup challenges, the final state meets both success criteria with working test execution and verifiable core functionality.
