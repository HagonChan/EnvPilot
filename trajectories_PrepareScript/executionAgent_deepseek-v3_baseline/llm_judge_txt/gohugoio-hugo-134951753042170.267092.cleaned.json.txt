FAILED
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): The agent was unable to successfully build and start a Docker container, which is a prerequisite for running any test suites. Multiple attempts to create and run a Dockerfile resulted in errors ("failed to start container"). Without a running container, no test suites could be executed.

2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): Similarly, since the container could not be started, there was no opportunity to verify core functionality by importing modules or making API calls. The environment was never successfully configured to a point where basic functionality could be tested.

The repeated failures to start a container indicate fundamental issues with either the Docker configuration or the environment setup, preventing both test execution and core functionality verification. The agent exhausted its attempts without achieving either success criterion.
