FAILED
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): Not met. The agent was unable to successfully clone the SDL repository due to git not being properly installed in the container. Without the source code, no test suite could be executed. Multiple attempts to install git failed due to package fetch errors (502 Bad Gateway).

2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): Not met. The fundamental step of obtaining the project source code failed, making it impossible to verify any core functionality. The environment couldn't even reach the stage where modules could be imported or basic API calls could be tested.

The environment configuration failed because:
- Critical dependency (git) couldn't be reliably installed
- Source code repository couldn't be cloned
- No test suite could be initiated
- No core functionality could be verified
- The process stalled at the very first step of obtaining the project code

The failure was primarily due to package installation issues (502 errors from Ubuntu repositories) which prevented the establishment of even the most basic development environment. Without git and the source code, no further progress was possible.
