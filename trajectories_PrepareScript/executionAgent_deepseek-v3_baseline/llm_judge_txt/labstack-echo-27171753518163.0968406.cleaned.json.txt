FAILED
Detailed reasoning:
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): Failed - The output shows an empty "ExecutionAgent_attempt" array, indicating no test suite was executed at all. There is no evidence of any test suite starting, executing, or finishing successfully.

2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): Failed - With no execution attempts recorded, there is no evidence that core modules can be imported or used normally. The empty output provides no indication that basic API calls work or core features are functional.

The complete lack of execution attempts means neither of the two success criteria were met. The agent didn't even reach the stage where we could evaluate test results or core functionality.
