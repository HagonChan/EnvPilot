PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The agent successfully executed both unit tests (`make test`) and end-to-end tests (`make e2e`). The e2e tests ran 214 specs with 212 passing and 2 skipped, demonstrating that the test framework can start, execute, and complete successfully with a comprehensive test report structure.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The project was successfully built (`make build`), producing both frps and frpc binaries. The successful execution of the test suites, particularly the end-to-end tests which cover integration scenarios, confirms that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally. The high pass rate (212/214) indicates core functionality is working as expected.

The environment configuration meets both success criteria: test suites completed execution and core functionality was verified, despite 2 tests being skipped (which doesn't affect the fundamental operability of the framework). The Go version issue was resolved during setup, allowing all subsequent operations to complete successfully.
