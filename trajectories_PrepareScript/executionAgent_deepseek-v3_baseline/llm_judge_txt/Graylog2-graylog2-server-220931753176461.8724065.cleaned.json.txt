FAILED
1. Test Suite Execution: The output shows that the TypeScript compilation ('yarn tsc') failed with multiple type errors in 'useEventDefinitionMutations.ts'. This indicates the test suite cannot start or execute successfully as the code cannot be compiled. The compilation errors are critical and prevent any test suite from running.

2. Core Functionality Verification: While the agent successfully located and read key files like 'useEventDefinitionMutations.ts' and 'event-definitions-types.ts', the fundamental type mismatches prevent core functionality from being verified. The compilation errors suggest that main functional modules cannot be properly imported or used in their current state.

The environment configuration fails because:
- The TypeScript compilation errors block any test suite execution (failing Condition 1)
- The type system errors indicate core modules cannot be properly imported/used (failing Condition 2)
- The agent reached the maximum call limit without resolving these fundamental issues

While the agent made progress in setting up Node.js and locating files, the unresolved compilation errors mean neither success criterion was met. The type system issues need to be resolved before either condition can be satisfied.
