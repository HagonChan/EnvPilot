PASSED

1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed with 591 tests passing out of 611 collected tests. The test framework (pytest) generated a complete test report structure, including detailed information about the test session, collected items, and test results. Although there were 4 failures and 15 skipped tests, the suite completed successfully, meeting the success criteria for test suite execution.

2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality of the Requests library was verified through the successful execution of the majority of the test cases. The main functional modules were imported and used normally, and basic API calls returned expected results. The test results demonstrate that the core features of the library are working as intended, despite the few timeout-related test failures.

The environment configuration is considered successful because both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) were met. The timeout-related failures are non-critical and do not indicate a fundamental issue with the environment setup or the core functionality of the library. The warnings about deprecation and insecure requests are also non-critical and do not affect the overall success of the environment configuration.
