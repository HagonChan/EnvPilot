PASSED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The test suite executed successfully with all 110 test suites passing and 1365 tests completed. The test coverage report shows excellent coverage (99.13% statements, 96.59% branches, 99.66% functions). The testing framework generated a complete test report structure including coverage details.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The TypeScript type checking ('npm run check:type:ts') completed successfully, indicating core modules can be imported and used normally. The successful test execution across all test suites demonstrates that basic API calls return expected results and core features are functioning properly.

The environment configuration fully meets both success criteria:
- The test suite completed execution with comprehensive results
- Core functionality was verified through both test execution and type checking
- All dependencies were properly installed and configured
- The project is in a fully operational state
