FAILED

1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**: The agent failed to execute any test suite. Multiple attempts to build a Docker container (the primary method for setting up the environment) failed due to network connectivity issues preventing Docker from pulling base images (`rust:latest`, `rust:1.55.0`, `ubuntu:latest`, `ubuntu:20.04`). Without a functional container, the agent could not proceed to run `cargo test` or any other test commands. The restricted terminal environment also prevented direct execution of Rust-related commands (e.g., `curl` to install Rust or `cargo run` in examples).

2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**: The agent could not verify core functionality. While the project structure and files (e.g., `Cargo.toml`, source files in `core/lib/src/`) were inspected, no actual Rust code execution or module imports were tested due to the inability to set up the Rust environment. The Dockerfile configuration was correct in theory, but the build failures prevented any practical validation of the framework's operability.

**Key Failure Points**:
- Docker image resolution failures blocked environment setup.
- Restricted terminal permissions prevented manual Rust installation or test execution.
- No test suite execution or core functionality verification was achieved. 

The agent exhausted its options without meeting either success criterion.
