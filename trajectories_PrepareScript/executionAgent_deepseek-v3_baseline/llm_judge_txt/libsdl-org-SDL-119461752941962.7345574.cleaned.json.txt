FAILED
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): Not met - The environment setup failed before reaching any test execution phase. The fundamental requirement of installing git (needed to clone the repository) was not successfully completed due to persistent network issues (502 Bad Gateway errors) during package installation.

2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): Not met - The project repository was never successfully cloned due to git not being properly installed, so no core functionality could be verified. The environment couldn't even reach the stage of importing or testing any project modules.

Key failure points:
- Multiple attempts to install git failed due to network issues with Ubuntu package repositories
- The git command remained unavailable in the container environment
- Without git, the SDL repository couldn't be cloned, preventing any further setup steps
- The Docker environment was only partially configured, missing critical dependencies

The environment configuration failed at the most basic level of dependency installation, preventing any progress toward either test execution or core functionality verification.
