FAILED
1. Test Suite Execution: The agent was unable to successfully execute any test suite for Halide. The critical dependency (LLVM) could not be installed either via package manager or direct download, which prevents the build process from completing. The CMake configuration for LLVM succeeded but the actual build was never attempted due to missing dependencies.

2. Core Functionality Verification: No core functionality could be verified as the project failed to build. The Halide build process couldn't proceed past the LLVM installation step, which means no modules were built or could be imported. The agent exhausted multiple installation methods (direct download, package manager, source build) without success.

The environment configuration failed because:
- Critical dependency (LLVM) installation failed repeatedly
- No test suite could be executed
- No core functionality could be verified
- The build process couldn't complete due to missing dependencies
- The agent hit multiple 404 errors when trying to download LLVM binaries
