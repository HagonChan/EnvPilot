PASSED

1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**: The agent successfully executed the test suite for OpenRefine and its extensions. All tests passed without failures, errors, or skips across all modules (core, GREL, main, server, Jython, Wikibase, Database, etc.). The test suite completed successfully, generating a complete test report structure, as evidenced by the BUILD SUCCESS message and detailed test results.

2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**: The agent successfully built the project using './refine build', which involved compiling the source code and preparing it for execution. The core functional modules were imported and used normally, as demonstrated by the successful execution of the test suite. Basic API calls returned expected results, and core features were verified through the test execution.

The environment configuration meets both success criteria:
- The test suite completed execution successfully (Condition 1)
- Core functionality was verified through test execution and project building (Condition 2)

Note: While there were initial challenges with Node.js version conflicts, the agent successfully resolved them by manually installing the correct version, demonstrating the environment was properly configured for the project's requirements.
