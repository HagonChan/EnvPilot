FAILED
Detailed reasoning:
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): Failed - The execution attempt array is empty, indicating no test suite was even attempted to run. There is no evidence of any test suite starting, executing, or finishing successfully.

2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): Failed - With no execution attempts recorded, there is no evidence that core modules can be imported or used normally. No API calls were made and no example code was executed to verify basic functionality.

The complete absence of any execution attempts means neither of the two success criteria could be met. The agent didn't progress far enough in the configuration process to even attempt running tests or verifying core functionality.
