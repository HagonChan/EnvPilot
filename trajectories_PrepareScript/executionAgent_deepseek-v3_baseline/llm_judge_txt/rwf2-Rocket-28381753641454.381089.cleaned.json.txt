PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The `cargo test` command executed successfully with all tests passing (66 tests in the main suite plus additional test groups). The test framework generated complete test reports showing "ok" results for all test cases with no failures. While there were some warnings about configuration and unused variables, these did not prevent the test suite from completing successfully.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The successful build (`cargo build`) and test execution demonstrate that the core modules can be imported and used normally. The test results show that basic API calls and core features are working as expected across multiple functional areas (routing, configuration, form handling, etc.). The project built successfully in the Docker environment and all test suites completed without critical errors.

The environment configuration meets both success criteria - the test suite completed execution successfully and core functionality has been verified through comprehensive test results. The warnings present do not indicate any critical failures that would prevent the project from functioning as intended.
