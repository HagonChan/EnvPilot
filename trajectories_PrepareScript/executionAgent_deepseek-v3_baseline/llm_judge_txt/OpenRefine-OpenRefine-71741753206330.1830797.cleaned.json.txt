FAILED
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): The output shows repeated failures in attempting to install Node.js and npm, with commands getting stuck in pagers or failing with "No such file or directory" errors. There is no evidence of any test suite being able to start, execute, and finish successfully.

2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): The core Node.js/npm installation is failing repeatedly, which means the main functional modules cannot be imported or used normally. The basic API calls and core features cannot be verified since the fundamental dependencies aren't properly installed.

The agent exceeded maximum call limits without achieving basic functionality, with multiple termination attempts needed due to stuck processes. The environment configuration has failed to meet either of the two success criteria.
