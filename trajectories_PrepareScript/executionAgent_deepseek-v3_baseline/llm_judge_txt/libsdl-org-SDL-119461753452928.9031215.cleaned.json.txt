PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The output shows that all 17 tests in the SDL project passed successfully when running 'ctest'. The test suite completed with 100% pass rate, generating a complete test report structure with individual test results and total execution time (51.29 seconds). This fully meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The successful build of the SDL library (with target 'testoffscreen' built to 100%) and the passing of all test cases demonstrate that the core functionality is working correctly. The tests cover various aspects of the library including automation, atomic operations, error handling, threading, filesystem operations, and audio functionality, indicating the main functional modules are operational. This satisfies Condition 2 of the success criteria.

The environment configuration is successful as both critical criteria are met: the test suite completed execution with all tests passing, and the core functionality has been verified through the comprehensive test results. The Docker container setup, build process, and test execution all worked as expected without any fundamental failures.
