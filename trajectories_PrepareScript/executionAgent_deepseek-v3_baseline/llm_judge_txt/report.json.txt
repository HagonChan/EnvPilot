FAILED
Detailed reasoning:
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): All 7 attempts failed to complete any test suite execution (as shown by the empty "passed" list and 7 "failed" entries). No test suite was able to start, execute and finish successfully.
2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): Since no test suite could complete, we cannot verify core functionality. The complete failure of all attempts suggests fundamental environment configuration issues preventing even basic test execution.
3. The output shows 100% failure rate across all attempts, with no successful test suite completion or core functionality demonstration in any case. This clearly fails both success criteria.
