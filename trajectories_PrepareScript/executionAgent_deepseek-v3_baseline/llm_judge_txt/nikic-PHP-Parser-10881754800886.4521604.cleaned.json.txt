FAILED
Detailed reasoning:
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): FAILED - The provided trajectory shows an empty execution attempt array ("ExecutionAgent_attempt": []), indicating no test suite was even attempted or executed. There is no evidence of any test suite starting, running, or completing.

2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): FAILED - With no execution attempts recorded, there is no evidence that core modules were imported or basic functionality was verified. The empty trajectory suggests the agent didn't reach any stage of environment configuration where core functionality could be tested.

The complete lack of execution attempts means neither of the two success criteria could be met. The agent appears to have failed before reaching any meaningful configuration or testing stage.
