FAILED

Detailed reasoning based on the success criteria:

1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):
- The build process encountered multiple errors and did not complete successfully. Key issues included:
  * Missing Go version 1.23.0 (initially had 1.18.1)
  * Cargo.lock file parsing error for ext_taosws
  * Invalid Go version format in go.mod file
- While some dependencies were successfully built (ext_lzma2, ext_jansson, etc.), the critical taoskeeper component failed to build
- No test suite was executed to completion as the build process never reached that stage

2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):
- The core TDengine functionality could not be verified because:
  * The build process failed before producing complete binaries
  * No successful installation was achieved
  * No service startup or basic API verification was possible
- While some components compiled, the system as a whole was not functional

Additional failure indicators:
- The agent exceeded reasonable effort in attempting to resolve build issues
- Multiple critical errors remained unresolved (Go version mismatch, Cargo.lock issue)
- No complete test suite execution was achieved
- Core modules could not be imported or verified

The environment configuration did not meet either of the two success criteria, resulting in a FAILED evaluation. While significant progress was made in resolving dependencies, the fundamental build failures prevented successful verification of either test suite execution or core functionality.
