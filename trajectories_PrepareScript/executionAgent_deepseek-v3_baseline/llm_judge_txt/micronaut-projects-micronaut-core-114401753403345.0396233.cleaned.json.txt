FAILED
Detailed reasoning:
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): Failed - The ExecutionAgent_attempt array is empty, indicating no test suite was executed at all. There is no evidence of any test suite starting, executing, or finishing successfully. No test report structure was generated.

2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): Failed - With no execution attempts recorded, there is no evidence that core functional modules can be imported or used normally. No API calls were made and no example code was executed to verify basic functionality.

The empty ExecutionAgent_attempt array indicates the agent either didn't attempt any configuration steps or failed before reaching any meaningful execution phase. Both critical success criteria were not met.
