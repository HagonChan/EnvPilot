FAILED

1. Test Suite Execution: The agent was unable to successfully execute any complete test suite. While it attempted to run various test commands (`go test ./...`, `go test -v ./...`, `go test -race ./...`, and `./tests/tests_all.sh`), all attempts resulted in errors related to Go version mismatches and missing Docker configuration files. The test suite did not complete successfully, and no test report structure was generated.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The agent did not demonstrate that core functional modules can be imported and used normally. While it successfully set up the Docker environment and installed dependencies, it did not execute any example code or API calls to verify core functionality. The focus remained on resolving test execution issues rather than validating basic operational capabilities.

The environment configuration failed because neither of the two success criteria were met. The test suite could not complete execution, and core functionality was not verified. The agent encountered persistent issues with Go version compatibility and Docker configuration that prevented successful validation of the environment.
