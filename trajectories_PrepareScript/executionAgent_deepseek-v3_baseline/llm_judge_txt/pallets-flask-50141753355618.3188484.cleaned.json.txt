FAILED

1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - PASSED
   - The test suite executed successfully with 475 passed tests and 7 skipped tests out of 481 collected tests
   - A complete test report structure was generated and documented in TEST_RESULTS.txt
   - The pytest framework completed execution without critical errors

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - FAILED
   - There is no evidence that core functional modules were imported and tested
   - No verification of basic API calls or example code execution was performed
   - The agent focused solely on test execution without demonstrating core functionality

The environment configuration fails because while the test suite executed successfully (meeting Condition 1), there was no verification of the actual application's core functionality (failing Condition 2). The success criteria requires both conditions to be met. The agent should have included steps to verify basic Flask functionality through example imports and API calls.
