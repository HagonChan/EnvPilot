FAILED

1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent was unable to successfully build and start a Docker container with the Hugo environment. Multiple attempts to create and run a Dockerfile resulted in errors ("failed to start container for image gohugoio-hugo-13495_image:executionagent"). No test suite execution was observed, as the container never reached a functional state where tests could be run.

2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality of Hugo could not be verified because:
   - The Docker container failed to start in all attempts
   - The Hugo binary was never successfully built and verified (the `go build` command consistently failed)
   - Basic container operations (like simple `ls` commands) failed to execute
   - No successful Hugo version check or basic command execution was achieved

The environment configuration failed because:
- The Docker setup was never operational
- No test suite could be executed
- Core Hugo functionality couldn't be verified
- The agent hit the maximum call limit without achieving basic functionality

The repeated container startup failures suggest fundamental issues with either:
1) The Docker environment configuration
2) The base image compatibility
3) Missing critical dependencies
4) System-level restrictions preventing container execution

Without being able to successfully start a container or verify basic Hugo functionality, the environment configuration cannot be considered successful.
