FAILED

1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The test suite execution was not fully successful. While the build process completed and many tests passed, there was a skipped test in LocalizedMessageTest.java and a build failure related to the Jacoco agent during test execution. The test suite did not fully complete due to these issues.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The core functionality verification was not achieved. The build process encountered multiple issues including Java version incompatibility (initially JDK 11 when JDK 17 was required), Maven installation problems, and Jacoco agent resolution failures. While some tests did run successfully, the core build and test process did not complete without errors.

The environment configuration did not meet both success criteria because:
- The test suite did not fully complete (one test was skipped and there were Jacoco-related failures)
- Core functionality verification was interrupted by build and dependency issues
- The agent exceeded reasonable attempts to resolve the Java version and Jacoco dependency problems without achieving stable functionality

Note that while the project did eventually build successfully with Java 17 and many tests passed, the persistent Jacoco issues and skipped test mean we cannot consider this a complete success according to the defined criteria.
