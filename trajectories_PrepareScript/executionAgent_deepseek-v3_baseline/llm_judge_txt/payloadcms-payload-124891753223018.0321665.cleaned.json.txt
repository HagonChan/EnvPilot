FAILED
1. Test Suite Execution: No test suite was executed or completed successfully. The attempts to set up the environment via Docker failed due to network issues when trying to fetch the base image 'node:18-alpine' from Docker Hub. The Docker build process did not complete, preventing any test execution.
2. Core Functionality Verification: There is no evidence that core functional modules were imported or used. The environment setup was not completed, so basic API calls or core features could not be verified. The Docker build failures indicate the system lacked the necessary environment to proceed with any functional verification.
The agent exceeded its attempts to configure the environment without achieving basic functionality, meeting the failure conditions.
