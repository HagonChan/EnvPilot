FAILED

1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**: The test suite failed to execute successfully. The command `go test ./...` resulted in build failures across multiple packages (`github.com/gin-gonic/gin`, `github.com/gin-gonic/gin/binding`, etc.) due to a runtime conflict (`runExitHooks redeclared`). This indicates the testing framework could not complete execution, which violates the success criteria.

2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**: While the agent successfully set up the Go environment (including version 1.23.0) and downloaded dependencies, the critical runtime error prevented any verification of core functionality. No evidence was provided that main modules could be imported or basic API calls worked, as the environment was fundamentally broken at the runtime level.

Key failure points:
- Runtime conflict in Go 1.23.0 (`proc.go` vs `exithook.go`) caused unrecoverable build failures
- No test suite completed execution (all packages failed at build stage)
- Core functionality could not be verified due to runtime instability
- Agent exhausted debugging options without resolving the runtime issue

The environment configuration did not meet either success condition.
