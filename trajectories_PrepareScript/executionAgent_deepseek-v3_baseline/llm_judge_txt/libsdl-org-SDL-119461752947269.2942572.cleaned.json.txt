FAILED

1. Test Suite Execution: The agent failed to execute any test suite successfully. The CMake configuration process encountered multiple errors, particularly regarding missing X11 or Wayland development libraries, which are essential for SDL to create windows on a Unix operating system. Although some dependencies were installed, the configuration remained incomplete, preventing the build and subsequent test execution.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The core functionality of the SDL library could not be verified because the build process did not complete successfully. The CMake configuration errors indicate that critical components required for SDL's operation (such as window creation) were not properly set up, making it impossible to import or use the main functional modules.

The agent made multiple attempts to resolve the dependency issues but ultimately did not achieve a successful build or test execution. The environment configuration did not meet either of the two success criteria.
