PASSED

1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):**  
   - The test suite (`npm test`) executed successfully, completing all test phases including size checks (`test:size`), formatting checks (`fmt:check`), unit tests (`test:unit`), type tests (`test:types`), and license checks (`test:license`).  
   - The unit tests (`test:unit`) ran 100+ test cases across modules like `cli`, `core`, `deps`, and `error`, all passing without critical failures.  
   - A complete test report structure was generated, confirmed by the detailed output and the creation of `TEST_RESULTS.txt`.  

2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):**  
   - Core modules (e.g., `cli.ts`, `core.ts`, `deps.ts`) were successfully imported and tested, as evidenced by the unit test output.  
   - Basic API calls (e.g., `$`, `cd()`, `within()`) returned expected results during testing.  
   - Example executions (e.g., command substitution, error handling, pipe operations) demonstrated functional core features.  

**Key Notes:**  
- Non-critical warnings (e.g., `import.meta` unsupported in target environment) did not prevent test completion or core functionality.  
- The environment was correctly configured with Node.js v22.17.1, resolving earlier version conflicts.  
- The agent achieved both success criteria despite initial hurdles (Node.js version upgrades, test command adjustments).  

**Failure Conditions Avoided:**  
- No test suite was blocked (all phases completed).  
- Core modules were importable and operational.  
- The agent stayed within call limits and resolved issues iteratively.
