FAILED
1. Test Suite Execution: The test suite did not complete successfully. The command 'cargo test --all' encountered linker errors with 'cc' being terminated (signal 9 [Killed]), likely due to resource constraints. The compilation failed for several components including 'forc-node', 'forc-crypto', 'forc-util', 'forc-tx', 'forc-fmt', 'forc', and 'forc-debug'. This indicates that the test suite could not start, execute, and finish successfully.

2. Core Functionality Verification: While the 'cargo build --release' command was executed and compiled numerous dependencies and project components, there is no evidence that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally, or that basic API calls return expected results. The build process was incomplete due to the subsequent test failures, and no example code execution was demonstrated to verify core functionality.

The environment configuration does not meet the success criteria as the test suite did not complete and core functionality was not verified. The linker errors suggest potential resource limitations or configuration problems that need to be addressed.
