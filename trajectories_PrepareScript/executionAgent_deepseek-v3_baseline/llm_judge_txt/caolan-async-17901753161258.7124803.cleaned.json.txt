FAILED
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): Not met. The agent was unable to successfully build and run a Docker container that could execute the test suite. Multiple attempts to create a working Dockerfile failed with container initialization errors, preventing any test execution from occurring.

2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): Not met. Since the environment setup failed at the Docker container stage, there was no opportunity to verify core functionality through module imports or API calls. The project dependencies were never successfully installed in a working environment.

Key failure points:
- Repeated Docker container initialization failures across multiple Dockerfile versions
- Inability to successfully install git and other dependencies in the container
- No evidence of any test suite being executed or core functionality being verified
- The agent exhausted its attempts without achieving a working environment configuration

The environment configuration was unsuccessful because neither basic test execution nor core functionality verification could be achieved due to fundamental container setup issues.
