PASSED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The output shows that 'cargo test' was successfully executed with all tests passing (166 in lib.rs, 7 in main.rs, 72 in testsuite, and example tests). This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute successfully.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The project was successfully built ('cargo build'), installed ('cargo install --path .'), and verified ('mdbook --version'). The core functionality is confirmed working as the mdbook executable was properly installed and can be invoked, demonstrating the main functional modules are operational.

The environment configuration is successful as both critical conditions are met: test suites completed successfully and core functionality is verified. The initial Rust version issues were resolved by updating to a compatible version (1.88.0), allowing all dependencies to build properly. The final verification with 'mdbook --version' confirms the tool is correctly installed and functional.
