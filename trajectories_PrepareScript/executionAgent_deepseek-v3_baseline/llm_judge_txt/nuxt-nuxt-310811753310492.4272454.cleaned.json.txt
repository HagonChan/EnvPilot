FAILED

1. Test Suite Execution: The test suite failed to execute successfully. The command 'pnpm test' encountered a module not found error for '@nuxt/kit/dist/index.mjs', which is required by '@nuxt/test-utils/dist/config.mjs'. This indicates a critical dependency resolution issue that prevents the test suite from starting and completing. The error suggests that the environment is not properly configured to locate or install necessary dependencies, which is a fundamental requirement for the test suite to run.

2. Core Functionality Verification: While the Docker container was successfully built and the project dependencies were partially installed using pnpm, the core functionality could not be verified due to the unresolved dependency issues. The inability to resolve '@nuxt/kit' and other peer dependencies (like 'vue-tsc' and 'svgo') suggests that the core modules may not be importable or functional in the current environment. The repeated failures in dependency installation and the inability to proceed past these errors mean we cannot confirm that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally.

The environment configuration does not meet either of the success criteria due to unresolved dependency issues that prevent both test suite execution and core functionality verification. The agent exceeded the maximum call limit without achieving basic functionality, resulting in a failed configuration attempt.
