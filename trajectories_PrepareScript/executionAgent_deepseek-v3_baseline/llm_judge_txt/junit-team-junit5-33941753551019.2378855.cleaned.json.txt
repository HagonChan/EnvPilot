FAILED
Detailed reasoning:
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): Failed - The ExecutionAgent_attempt array is empty, indicating no test suite was even attempted to be executed. There is no evidence of any test suite starting, executing or finishing successfully.

2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): Failed - With no execution attempts recorded, there's no evidence that core functional modules can be imported or used normally. No API calls were made and no example code was executed to verify basic functionality.

The complete lack of any execution attempts means neither of the two success criteria were met. The agent didn't progress far enough to even attempt basic verification of the environment configuration.
