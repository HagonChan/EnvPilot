FAILED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The test suite execution was attempted but failed due to multiple issues:
   - Docker daemon could not be started inside the container due to filesystem restrictions (read-only filesystem)
   - Kubernetes cluster setup failed because Minikube couldn't start without Docker
   - Some tests failed with errors related to CRD annotations and Wasm module fetching
   - While some tests passed, no complete test suite finished successfully due to these fundamental issues

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - Core functionality verification was not achieved:
   - The initialization process ('make init') failed repeatedly due to Docker issues
   - Critical components requiring Kubernetes (like CRD validation) couldn't be verified
   - The environment couldn't be properly configured to import and use main functional modules

The environment configuration did not meet either success criteria due to fundamental infrastructure issues (Docker/Kubernetes setup problems) that prevented both test execution and core functionality verification. While some individual tests passed, the overall setup was incomplete and unstable.
