PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The test suite executed successfully with 3783 tests passed, 129 skipped, 11 expected failures (xfailed), and 1 unexpected pass (xpassed). The pytest framework generated a complete test report structure, and the test session completed without being interrupted by critical errors. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The main functional modules were successfully imported and used, as evidenced by the test suite execution. The core functionality of pytest was demonstrated through the execution of numerous test cases across different modules. The installation of additional dependencies (hypothesis, attr, xmlschema) resolved initial import errors, allowing the test suite to run to completion. This meets Condition 2 of the success criteria.

The environment configuration is successful because both conditions are satisfied: the test suite completed execution and core functionality was verified. The presence of some test failures (xfailed) and an unexpected pass (xpassed) does not constitute a failure according to the success criteria, as these are non-critical issues that don't affect the fundamental operability of the framework.
