PASSED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The test suite was successfully executed with 'rake test', completing 1647 tests (1639 passed, 0 failed, 8 skipped) and 100 bintests (all passed). The test framework generated a complete report structure showing all test outcomes.
2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The build summary shows all core mruby components and gems were properly included and functional. The successful test execution demonstrates core modules can be imported and used normally, with basic API calls returning expected results (evidenced by the high pass rate).

The environment configuration meets both success criteria despite some test skips (which are acceptable per criteria) and minor file path issues during debugging. The core functionality works and the test suite completed successfully.
