FAILED

1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent was unable to execute any test suite. The Docker container setup failed repeatedly with errors related to image resolution and container initialization ("failed to start container for image concourse-concourse-9103_image:executionagent"). Without a functioning container, the test suite could not be executed, and no test report was generated.

2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent could not verify core functionality. The Docker container setup issues prevented the agent from importing or using any core modules, making it impossible to execute basic API calls or demonstrate core features. The environment was not properly configured to support the project's requirements.

The agent encountered persistent Docker-related issues (network connectivity, image resolution, and container initialization) that prevented both test suite execution and core functionality verification. No successful environment configuration was achieved.
