FAILED
Detailed reasoning:
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): Failed - The output shows an empty "ExecutionAgent_attempt" array, indicating no test suite was executed at all. There is no evidence of any test suite starting, executing, or completing.

2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): Failed - With no execution attempts recorded, there is no evidence that core modules can be imported or that basic API calls work. The complete lack of execution data means we cannot verify any core functionality.

The empty execution record suggests the agent either didn't attempt any configuration steps or failed before reaching the point of test execution. Without any positive signals in either criteria category, this must be considered a failure case.
