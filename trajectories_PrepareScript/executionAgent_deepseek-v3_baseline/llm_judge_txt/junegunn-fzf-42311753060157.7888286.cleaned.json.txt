FAILED
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): The Docker container was successfully built and started, but there is no evidence that any test suite actually executed and completed. The final Dockerfile configuration includes a command to run tests (`ruby test/runner.rb`), but we don't see the actual test execution results or confirmation that tests completed.

2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): While the Docker image was built and the container started, there's no verification that core functionality works. The Makefile shows the project has both Go and Ruby components, but we don't see any evidence that:
   - The main binary was successfully built (`make install`)
   - Core modules can be imported and used
   - Basic API calls return expected results
   - Any example code executed successfully

The trajectory shows multiple failed attempts to build the Docker image before finally succeeding, but stops short of actually demonstrating either test suite completion or core functionality verification. The final state only shows the container was started, not that any meaningful verification was performed.
