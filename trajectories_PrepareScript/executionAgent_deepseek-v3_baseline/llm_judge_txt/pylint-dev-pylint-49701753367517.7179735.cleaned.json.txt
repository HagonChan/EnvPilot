PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The test suite was successfully executed with 1978 tests passed, 272 skipped, and 5 expected failures out of 2255 collected items. The pytest framework generated a complete test report, including benchmark results, indicating that the test suite completed successfully despite some skipped tests and expected failures.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The Docker container was successfully built and started, and the project's main functional modules were installed and tested. The test results show that the core functionality is working as expected, with the majority of tests passing. The benchmark tests also indicate that the core features are operational and performing within expected parameters.

The environment configuration meets both success criteria: the test suite completed execution and the core functionality was verified through successful test runs. The presence of some skipped tests and expected failures does not detract from the overall success as these are accounted for in the test design.
