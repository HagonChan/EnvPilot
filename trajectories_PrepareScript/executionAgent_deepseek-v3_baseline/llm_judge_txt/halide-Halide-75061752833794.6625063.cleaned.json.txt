FAILED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The agent did not successfully execute any test suite. The trajectory shows multiple attempts to set up the environment (Docker container, LLVM installation, C++ compiler installation), but there's no evidence of any test suite being executed to completion. The process failed at the LLVM build stage before reaching test execution.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - There's no demonstration that main functional modules can be imported and used normally. The agent's attempts were focused on environment setup (Docker, LLVM) but didn't progress far enough to verify core functionality through API calls or example code execution.

The environment configuration process failed because:
- LLVM build failed due to initial missing C++ compiler
- Even after compiler installation, the LLVM build wasn't successfully completed
- No test suites were executed
- No core functionality was verified
- The process didn't reach a point where either success condition could be satisfied

The agent made progress in setting up the environment (Docker, installing dependencies) but didn't complete the critical steps needed to validate the configuration against the success criteria.
