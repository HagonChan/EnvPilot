FAILED

1. Test Suite Execution: The agent was unable to successfully execute any test suite. Despite multiple attempts to create and run a Dockerfile that would build the Typst project and run tests, each attempt resulted in errors ("failed to start container for image"). The Docker environment setup was not completed, preventing any test execution.

2. Core Functionality Verification: There is no evidence that core functionality was verified. The agent couldn't successfully build the project or run any tests due to the Docker container startup failures. No API calls or core functionality demonstrations were performed.

The environment configuration failed because:
- The Docker container could not be started (repeated "failed to start container" errors)
- No test suite was executed to completion
- No core functionality was verified
- The agent exceeded the maximum call limit without achieving basic functionality

The repeated Docker container startup failures indicate a fundamental issue with the environment setup that prevented any meaningful progress toward verifying the project's functionality.
