FAILED

1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**: The agent did not successfully execute any complete test suite. While significant effort was made to set up the environment (installing Node.js, npm, and resolving dependencies), the process was ultimately unsuccessful in running the test suite. The main obstacles were:
   - Persistent dependency conflicts (especially with tempusdominus-bootstrap-4 and tempusdominus-core)
   - Unresolved vulnerabilities in bootstrap and related packages
   - The test command (`make test`) was never actually executed

2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**: The agent failed to demonstrate that core functional modules can be imported and used normally. The setup process got stuck in dependency resolution and never reached the stage of:
   - Importing core modules
   - Making basic API calls
   - Executing example code

Key failure points:
- Couldn't properly resolve npm dependencies despite multiple attempts
- Never successfully built the UI components
- Never executed any Go tests (the primary language of the project)
- The Docker container setup remained incomplete for testing purposes

The agent exceeded reasonable effort limits (numerous installation attempts and dependency resolutions) without achieving either of the two required success criteria. While significant progress was made in environment setup, the fundamental requirements of having a working test suite and verifiable core functionality were not met.
