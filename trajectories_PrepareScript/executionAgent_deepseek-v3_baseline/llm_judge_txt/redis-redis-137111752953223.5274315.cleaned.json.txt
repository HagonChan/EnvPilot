FAILED

1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):**  
   - The Redis test suite failed to complete successfully. Multiple test cases reported "[err]: Can't start the Redis server" with "No PID detected in log" errors.  
   - While some tests passed (e.g., "CONFIG REWRITE handles alias config properly"), the suite terminated with errors (`make: *** [Makefile:11: test] Error 2`).  
   - The test framework generated output but did not finish execution due to critical failures (server startup issues).  

2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):**  
   - Core Redis binaries (e.g., `redis-server`, `redis-cli`) were successfully built, indicating basic compilation functionality.  
   - However, the inability to start Redis servers during testing suggests fundamental runtime issues (e.g., configuration or environment problems).  

**Key Issues:**  
- Server startup failures during tests imply the environment or configuration is misconfigured.  
- The test suite did not complete, and critical functionality (server execution) was not verified.  

**Note:**  
- While some tests passed, the suite's overall failure and inability to start Redis servers violate the success criteria.  
- The agent exhausted attempts to resolve the issues (e.g., adjusting `propagation-error-behavior`) without achieving stable test execution.
