FAILED
Detailed reasoning:
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): No test suite was executed or even attempted. The output only shows analysis of the go.mod file but no test execution was performed.
2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): No core functionality was verified. The agent only read the go.mod file but didn't attempt to import any modules or verify basic API functionality.
3. The output shows only initial environment analysis but no actual execution or verification of either test suites or core functionality, which are both required for success.
4. While the agent correctly identified the Go version and dependencies, it didn't progress to the actual verification stages needed to meet the success criteria.
