PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The test suite completed successfully with a comprehensive test report structure. Out of 6013 tests, there were only 2 failures and 1 error, with 120 skipped tests. The test execution output shows numerous test sets running successfully, indicating the testing framework operated normally and completed its execution.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The project built successfully with 'mvn clean package' and the majority of tests passed. The core modules were able to be imported and used as evidenced by the successful execution of thousands of test cases across various functional areas (networking, event bus, file system, etc.). The few failures appear to be specific test case issues rather than fundamental functionality problems.

The environment configuration meets both success criteria:
- The test suite executed to completion with a proper report structure
- Core functionality was verified through extensive test execution with only minimal failures that don't indicate fundamental system issues
