FAILED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - Not met. The agent was unable to execute any test suite due to fundamental environment setup failures. All attempts to build a Docker container (required to run npm commands) failed due to network connectivity issues with Docker registry. Without a working container, no test suite could be started or executed.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - Not met. The agent couldn't install project dependencies or verify core functionality because npm commands were blocked in the base environment and Docker container setup failed. No module imports or API functionality could be tested since the Node.js environment was never successfully established.

Key failure points:
- Repeated Docker build failures due to network timeouts when accessing Docker registry
- Inability to run npm install or any Node.js related commands in the base environment
- No successful execution of any project-specific commands or tests
- Environment restrictions prevented even basic network diagnostics (ping) to troubleshoot issues

The agent exhausted all reasonable attempts to configure the environment but was blocked by infrastructure-level networking issues that prevented Docker from functioning, which was a prerequisite for all subsequent setup steps.
