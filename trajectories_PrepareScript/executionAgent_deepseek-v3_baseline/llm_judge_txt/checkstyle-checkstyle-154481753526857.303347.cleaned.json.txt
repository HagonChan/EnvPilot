FAILED

1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - Not Met
- The agent never successfully executed any test suite. The build failed during `mvn clean install` due to Java version mismatch (requires Java 17 but detected Java 11)
- No test reports were generated as the build couldn't complete

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - Not Met
- The project couldn't be built due to Java version issues, so core modules were never compiled or verified
- No API calls or example executions were attempted since the build failed

Key Issues:
- Persistent Java version mismatch (project requires Java 17 but environment kept defaulting to Java 11)
- Multiple attempts to configure Java alternatives were unsuccessful
- Build process never completed successfully to reach testing phase

The environment configuration failed because:
1. The fundamental Java version requirement wasn't satisfied
2. No tests were executed
3. Core functionality was never verified
4. The agent exhausted attempts without resolving the Java version conflict
