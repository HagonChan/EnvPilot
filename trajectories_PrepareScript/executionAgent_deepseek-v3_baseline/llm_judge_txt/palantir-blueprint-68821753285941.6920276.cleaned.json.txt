FAILED

Detailed reasoning:
1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1): The agent was unable to execute any test suite. The Docker setup failed repeatedly due to network connectivity issues when trying to pull the required Node.js image. Without a working Docker container or local Node.js installation, the test suite (which would be run via `yarn verify`) could not be executed.

2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2): The agent couldn't verify core functionality because:
   - Node.js was never successfully installed (either via Docker or locally)
   - Project dependencies were never installed (the `yarn install` step never completed)
   - The environment restrictions prevented direct execution of Node.js or Yarn commands
   - No modules could be imported or tested due to the incomplete setup

The agent made multiple attempts to configure the environment through Docker but consistently encountered network-related failures when trying to access the Docker registry. The alternative approach of local installation via scripts was blocked by the environment's security restrictions.

Since neither test suite execution nor core functionality verification was achieved, the environment configuration must be considered a failure according to the success criteria. The fundamental blocking issues were the Docker registry connectivity problems and the environment's restrictions on local installation methods.
