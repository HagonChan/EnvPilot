FAILED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The agent did not reach the stage of executing any test suites. The process was stuck at attempting to install LLVM, which is a critical dependency for Halide. Without LLVM, the test suites cannot be executed.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The agent failed to install LLVM, which is required for Halide's core functionality. The core modules cannot be imported or used without LLVM, and basic API calls would not return expected results. The agent encountered repeated 502 Bad Gateway errors when trying to fetch necessary packages, preventing the successful installation of LLVM and subsequent verification of core functionality.

The environment configuration did not meet either of the success criteria due to unresolved dependency issues and network errors during package installation.
