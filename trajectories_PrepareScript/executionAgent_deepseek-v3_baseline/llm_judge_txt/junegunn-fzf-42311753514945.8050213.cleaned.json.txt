FAILED
1. Test Suite Execution: The test suite did not complete successfully. The execution encountered repeated errors related to tmux ("error connecting to /tmp/tmux-0/default (No such file or directory)") and eventually hung without completing. While the test framework started, it did not finish successfully due to these critical errors.

2. Core Functionality Verification: There is no evidence that core functionality was verified. The test suite never completed, and there was no demonstration of importing core modules or executing basic API calls. The tmux-related errors prevented proper verification of the core functionality.

The environment configuration failed because:
- The test suite could not complete due to tmux configuration issues
- Core functionality was not verified due to the test suite failure
- The agent exceeded reasonable attempts to resolve the tmux issues without success

Note: While Ruby gems were successfully installed, the tmux dependency issues prevented proper test execution, which is critical for the success criteria.
