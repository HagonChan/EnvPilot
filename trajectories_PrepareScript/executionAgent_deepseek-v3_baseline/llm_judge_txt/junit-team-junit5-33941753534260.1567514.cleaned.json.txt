FAILED
Detailed reasoning:
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): Failed - The execution attempt array is empty, indicating no test suite was even attempted to run. There is no evidence of any test suite starting, executing or finishing successfully.

2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): Failed - With no execution attempts recorded, there is no evidence that core modules can be imported or used normally. No API calls were made and no example code was executed to verify basic functionality.

The empty execution attempt array suggests the agent either failed to start the configuration process or encountered a critical error before any meaningful execution could occur. Without any recorded attempts to run tests or verify functionality, both success criteria remain unmet.
