FAILED

The environment configuration for the KaTeX project has failed to meet the success criteria for the following reasons:

1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**: 
   - No test suite was executed successfully. The agent attempted multiple times to set up the environment using Docker but consistently encountered errors when trying to start the container. The Dockerfile configurations failed to build and run the container, preventing any test suite from being executed.

2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**:
   - The core functionality of the project could not be verified because the environment setup was incomplete. The agent was unable to install dependencies or run any core modules due to the Docker container startup failures.

Detailed Reasoning:
- The agent made numerous attempts to create and run a Docker container with different configurations, including various base images (node:16, node:14) and different methods to install yarn (via npm, apt, etc.). All attempts resulted in errors, specifically "failed to start container for image katex-katex-3735_image:executionagent".
- The inability to start the Docker container means that the project's dependencies could not be installed, and thus, neither the test suites nor the core functionality could be verified.
- The agent also tried to use direct npm and yarn commands outside of Docker, but these were not permitted in the current environment, further limiting the ability to configure the environment successfully.

Since both conditions for success were not met (no test suite was executed, and core functionality could not be verified), the environment configuration is deemed a failure.
