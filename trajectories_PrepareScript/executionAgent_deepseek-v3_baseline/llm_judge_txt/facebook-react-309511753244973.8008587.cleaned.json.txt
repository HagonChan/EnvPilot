FAILED
1. Test Suite Execution: The agent attempted to set up the environment using Docker but failed to successfully build and start a container multiple times. There is no evidence that any test suite was executed or completed successfully. The Docker container setup failed at various stages (git installation, dependency installation, etc.), preventing any test execution.

2. Core Functionality Verification: While the agent successfully read the project files (README.md and package.json), there is no demonstration that core functional modules can be imported or used normally. The repeated Docker container failures prevented any verification of basic API calls or core features through example code execution.

The environment configuration did not meet either of the two success criteria. The fundamental Docker setup failures prevented both test execution and core functionality verification from being achieved.
