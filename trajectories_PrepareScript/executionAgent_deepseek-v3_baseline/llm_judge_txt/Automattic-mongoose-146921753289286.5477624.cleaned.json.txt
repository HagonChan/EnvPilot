FAILED
Detailed reasoning:
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): Failed - The execution agent attempt array is empty, indicating no test suite was even attempted to run. There is no evidence of any test execution or test report generation.

2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): Failed - With no execution attempts recorded, there's no demonstration that core modules can be imported or basic API calls work. The complete lack of execution activity means we cannot verify any core functionality.

The empty execution log suggests the agent either failed before reaching the testing/verification stage or encountered a critical error preventing any execution attempts. Without any recorded activity, both success criteria remain unfulfilled.
