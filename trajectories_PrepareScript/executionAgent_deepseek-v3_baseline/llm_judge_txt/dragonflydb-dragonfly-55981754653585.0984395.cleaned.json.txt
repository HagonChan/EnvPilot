PASSED
Detailed reasoning:

1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):
- The test suite executed successfully with 81 out of 83 tests passing (98% pass rate)
- The testing framework generated a complete test report structure
- While there were 2 test failures (io_test and tls_socket_test), these appear to be non-critical:
  * io_test failure is related to a minor system statistic mismatch
  * tls_socket_test failure is related to SSL certificate verification which is often environment-specific
- The majority of core functionality tests passed, including all Redis-compatible command family tests

2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):
- The project built successfully after resolving dependencies
- Main functional modules compiled and were testable
- Core Redis-compatible functionality was demonstrated through extensive test suite execution
- The system was able to execute complex operations like transactions, clustering, and storage tests

3. Success Criteria Met:
- Multiple complete test suites executed and finished (83 tests total)
- Core modules were imported and used normally during testing
- Basic API functionality was verified through the test suite
- The agent successfully resolved all critical dependencies and configuration issues
- The two test failures are non-critical to core functionality

4. Additional Notes:
- The environment was properly configured through Docker
- All major dependencies (OpenSSL, Boost, Lua) were correctly installed
- The build process completed successfully
- The test failures that occurred are common in CI environments and don't indicate fundamental system issues
