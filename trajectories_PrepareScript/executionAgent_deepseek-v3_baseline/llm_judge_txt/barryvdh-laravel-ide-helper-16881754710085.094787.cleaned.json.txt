FAILED
1. Test Suite Execution: The agent was unable to successfully execute any test suite. Despite multiple attempts to run 'phpunit' through Docker commands, all attempts failed due to restrictions on executing Docker commands directly. The test suite was never actually executed, so we cannot confirm if any tests would pass or fail.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The agent was unable to verify core functionality. While the Docker container was created and the project files were cloned, the critical 'composer install' step was never successfully executed inside the container due to the same Docker command restrictions. Without dependencies being installed, we cannot verify if core modules can be imported or basic API calls work.

The environment configuration failed because:
- No test suite was executed to completion
- Core dependencies were never installed
- The agent hit the maximum call limit without achieving basic functionality
- The Docker command restrictions prevented proper setup verification

The agent made repeated attempts to configure the environment but was ultimately blocked by system restrictions on Docker command execution, preventing both test execution and dependency installation.
