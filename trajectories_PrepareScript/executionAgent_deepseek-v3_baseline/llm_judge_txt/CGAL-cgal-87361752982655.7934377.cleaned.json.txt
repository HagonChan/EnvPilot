FAILED

1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**: The agent was unable to successfully execute any test suite. The primary issue was the inability to locate the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `/app/cgal` directory, which is essential for configuring and building the project. Without this file, the CMake configuration failed, preventing the build and execution of any tests. The agent attempted to resolve this by re-cloning the repository and checking the directory structure, but these efforts were unsuccessful due to persistent issues with the container's working directory and session management.

2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**: The agent did not reach the stage where core functionality could be verified. The failure to configure the project with CMake meant that the main functional modules could not be imported or tested. The agent's attempts to install dependencies and set up the environment were partially successful, but the critical step of project configuration was not achieved, leaving the core functionality untested.

**Conclusion**: Neither of the two success criteria was met. The agent encountered fundamental issues with the project setup, specifically the missing `CMakeLists.txt` file and problems with the container's directory structure, which prevented both test suite execution and core functionality verification.
