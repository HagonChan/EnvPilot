FAILED

1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):
- The test suite execution failed to complete successfully. While PHPUnit was installed and the test suite started running, it encountered multiple errors (31) and failures (7) out of 2530 tests.
- The test execution was terminated with "ERRORS!" status, indicating the test suite did not complete normally.
- There were configuration validation warnings about the PHPUnit configuration file that affected test results.

2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):
- While the project dependencies were successfully installed via composer, we cannot confirm core functionality works because:
  - The test suite failed to complete, which is our primary verification method
  - No manual verification of core functionality was performed (no API calls or example code execution shown)
  - The test failures suggest potential issues with fundamental assertions and method availability

Additional observations:
- The environment setup process encountered multiple issues (Docker image problems, Composer installation syntax errors)
- Memory limitations initially prevented test execution
- PHPUnit version compatibility issues were apparent (using 8.5.42 when newer versions required PHP 8.3+)
- Attempts to upgrade PHPUnit failed due to version constraint parsing errors

Neither of the two success criteria were fully met, resulting in a FAILED evaluation.
