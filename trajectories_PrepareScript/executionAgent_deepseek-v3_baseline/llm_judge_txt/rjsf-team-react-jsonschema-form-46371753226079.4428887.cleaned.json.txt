FAILED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The agent failed to successfully execute any test suite. Multiple attempts to build a Docker image and set up the environment resulted in errors during the installation of dependencies (git, yarn) and cloning of the repository. No test suite was executed or completed.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The agent was unable to verify core functionality as it couldn't successfully install dependencies or set up the environment. The Docker image build process consistently failed at various stages (git installation, yarn installation, repository cloning), preventing any verification of core modules or features.

The environment configuration failed because:
- No test suite could be executed (failed Condition 1)
- No core functionality could be verified (failed Condition 2)
- Multiple Docker build attempts failed at different stages
- The agent exceeded its maximum attempts without achieving basic functionality
