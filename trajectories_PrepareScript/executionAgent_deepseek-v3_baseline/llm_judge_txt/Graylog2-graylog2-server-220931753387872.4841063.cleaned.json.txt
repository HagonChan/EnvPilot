FAILED

1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):
- The build process consistently fails with a "tools.jar not found" error during compilation, preventing any test suite from executing
- No test suite was able to start or complete successfully
- The Maven build fails before reaching the testing phase due to fundamental JDK configuration issues

2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):
- Core modules cannot be compiled due to the missing tools.jar, indicating fundamental functionality is broken
- The project fails at the compilation stage, preventing any API calls or core feature verification
- No successful demonstration of core functionality through example code execution

Key Issues:
- Persistent "tools.jar not found" error despite multiple JDK reinstallations
- Build environment configuration remains incomplete/unstable
- Neither compilation nor test execution was achieved
- Core functionality cannot be verified due to compilation failures

The environment configuration does not meet either of the two success criteria, resulting in a FAILED evaluation. The fundamental build issues prevent both test execution and core functionality verification.
