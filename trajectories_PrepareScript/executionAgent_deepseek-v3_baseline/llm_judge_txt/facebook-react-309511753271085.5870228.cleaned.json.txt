FAILED

Detailed reasoning:
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The agent was unable to successfully execute any test suite. Multiple attempts to create and build a Dockerfile failed due to network connectivity issues (DNS lookup failures for Docker Hub) and Dockerfile syntax errors. The environment was never properly configured to the point where tests could be run.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The agent was unable to verify any core functionality. The project dependencies were never successfully installed due to the inability to build a working Docker container. The 'yarn install' command couldn't be executed directly in the restricted environment, and all attempts to containerize the environment failed.

The agent exhausted multiple approaches (different base images, different Dockerfile configurations) but was consistently blocked by network issues preventing Docker image pulls and environment restrictions preventing direct command execution. Without being able to install dependencies or run any tests, neither success condition was met.
