PASSED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The output shows multiple test suites executing successfully (e.g., cblas_zgemm, cblas_zhemm, etc.) with clear PASSED status for both error-exit tests and computational tests. The test framework generated complete reports showing test counts and pass/fail status.
2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The successful compilation of all BLAS routines and passing of computational tests demonstrates that core modules can be imported and used normally. The extensive test coverage across different BLAS operations confirms basic API functionality.
3. The agent successfully completed the environment setup (Docker container creation), compilation (make command), and test execution without hitting any maximum call limits or encountering critical failures.
4. While there were some compiler warnings (e.g., unused variable), these did not prevent the test suites from completing or core functionality from working. The documentation of results in TEST_RESULTS.txt further confirms successful configuration.
