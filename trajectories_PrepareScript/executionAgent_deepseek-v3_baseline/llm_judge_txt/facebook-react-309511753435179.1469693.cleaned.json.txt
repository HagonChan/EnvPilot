FAILED

1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent was unable to successfully execute any test suite. Multiple attempts to create and run a Docker container failed with errors during container initialization. The Dockerfile configurations were not able to successfully build an image or start a container, which is a prerequisite for running the test suite (`yarn test`).

2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent did not reach the stage where core functionality could be verified. The environment setup was incomplete due to persistent Docker container initialization failures. Without a functioning container, it was impossible to verify if core modules could be imported or if basic API calls would return expected results.

The agent exceeded the maximum call limit without achieving basic functionality, specifically failing to establish a working Docker container environment necessary for both test execution and core functionality verification.
