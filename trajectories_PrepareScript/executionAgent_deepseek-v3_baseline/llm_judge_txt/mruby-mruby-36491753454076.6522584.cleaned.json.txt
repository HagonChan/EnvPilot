FAILED
Detailed reasoning:
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): Failed - The output shows an empty execution attempt array ("ExecutionAgent_attempt": []), indicating no test suite was even attempted or executed. There is no evidence of any test suite starting, running, or completing.

2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): Failed - With no execution attempts recorded, there is no evidence that core modules can be imported or that basic API calls work. The complete lack of execution data means we cannot verify any core functionality.

The empty execution record suggests the agent either failed to start the configuration process or encountered critical errors before any meaningful execution could occur. Without any test suite execution or core functionality verification, this configuration attempt clearly fails both success criteria.
