FAILED

1. Test Suite Execution:
- The agent was unable to successfully execute any test suite for the lazygit project. Multiple attempts to build and run tests in a Docker container failed due to various issues including Dockerfile configuration errors and restrictions on using COPY commands.
- The final Dockerfile that was successfully built did not include test execution, and subsequent attempts to run tests were blocked by system restrictions on docker commands.
- No test results or reports were generated, indicating the test suite was never successfully executed.

2. Core Functionality Verification:
- While the Docker container was successfully started at one point, there is no evidence that core functionality was verified. The agent was unable to execute commands inside the container to test basic functionality or API calls.
- The main lazygit binary was built but never verified to work correctly. There's no demonstration of core features through example code execution.
- The project's main modules were never successfully imported or tested within the container environment.

The environment configuration failed because:
1. No test suite was ever successfully executed to completion
2. Core functionality was never verified through imports or basic API tests
3. The agent hit system restrictions that prevented proper verification
4. Multiple Docker build attempts failed before achieving a minimal working container

The agent was unable to meet either of the two required success criteria for environment configuration. While some progress was made in setting up the environment, the fundamental requirements of test execution and functionality verification were not achieved.
