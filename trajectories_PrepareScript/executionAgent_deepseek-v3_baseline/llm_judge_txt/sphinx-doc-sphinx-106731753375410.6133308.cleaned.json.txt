FAILED
1. Test Suite Execution: No test suite was executed or completed successfully. The agent only attempted to read files and create a Dockerfile, which failed due to syntax errors. There is no evidence of any test suite being run or completing.
2. Core Functionality Verification: There is no demonstration of core functionality being imported or used. The agent did not reach the stage where it could verify if main functional modules could be imported or if basic API calls returned expected results. The Dockerfile creation failure prevented any further progress in setting up the environment.
