FAILED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - Not met. The agent was unable to successfully build a Docker container due to network connectivity issues with Docker registry (proxy connection errors). Without a working container environment, no test suite could be executed. The Docker build process failed before any tests could be run.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - Not met. The agent never reached the stage of importing or testing core functionality. The environment setup failed at the Docker configuration stage, preventing any verification of core modules or features. The project's main modules were never loaded or tested.

The failure occurred at the foundational environment setup stage (Docker container creation), which prevented any subsequent verification steps from being attempted. Both critical success criteria depend on having a working environment, which was not achieved in this attempt.
