PASSED

1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed multiple test suites for the Caddy server project. While some tests failed (particularly integration tests related to certificate management), the majority of test suites completed successfully, as evidenced by the output showing numerous packages with 'ok' status. The test framework generated complete test reports, meeting the first success criterion.

2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent verified core functionality by:
   - Successfully building the Caddy executable
   - Running the Caddy server which displayed its help information and available commands
   - Executing multiple test suites that covered core modules (HTTP, TLS, PKI applications)
   - Installing necessary dependencies (libnss3-tools) for proper functionality

The environment configuration is considered successful because:
- Multiple test suites completed execution (despite some individual test failures)
- Core modules were importable and functional (as shown by successful builds and test runs)
- The main Caddy executable was built and could be run
- The agent demonstrated the ability to install required dependencies when needed

The failures in some integration tests don't invalidate the success as they appear to be test-specific issues rather than fundamental environment configuration problems. The core requirements of having a working test suite and functional core modules were met.
