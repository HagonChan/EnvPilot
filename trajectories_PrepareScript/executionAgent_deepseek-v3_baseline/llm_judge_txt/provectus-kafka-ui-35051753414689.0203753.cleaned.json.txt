FAILED
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): No test suite was executed or completed successfully. The agent attempted to build the environment via Docker but encountered multiple failures during the build process (Node.js/pnpm installation, Maven execution, dependency resolution). There's no evidence of any test suite being run or completing.

2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): No core functionality was verified. The agent never reached a stage where it could import or test any core modules. All attempts to build the environment failed before reaching a state where basic functionality could be verified.

The agent exceeded its maximum attempts without achieving either of the success criteria. The Docker build process failed at multiple stages (Node.js installation, Maven execution, dependency resolution) and no alternative verification methods were attempted. Without a successful build, neither test execution nor core functionality verification was possible.
