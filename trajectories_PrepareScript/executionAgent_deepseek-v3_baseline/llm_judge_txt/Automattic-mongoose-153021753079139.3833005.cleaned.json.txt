FAILED

1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**: The agent was unable to successfully start and execute any test suite. Multiple attempts to create and run a Docker container failed consistently with errors indicating container startup issues. Without a functioning container environment, the test suite could not be executed, and no test report structure was generated.

2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**: The agent did not reach a stage where core functional modules could be imported or used. The repeated Docker container startup failures prevented any verification of basic API calls or core features. The environment was never properly configured to a state where these verifications could be attempted.

The agent exceeded the maximum call limit without achieving either of the two success criteria. The fundamental inability to establish a working container environment means both critical conditions for successful environment configuration were not met.
