FAILED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - PASSED
   - The 'go test ./...' command successfully executed all test suites in the project (gorm.io/gorm and subdirectories)
   - Multiple test packages showed "ok" status indicating successful test execution
   - Some directories had no test files (marked as [no test files]) which is acceptable

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - FAILED
   - While tests passed, the 'go vet ./...' command revealed serious issues:
     - Multiple instances of lock passing by value (sync.RWMutex) which could cause concurrency issues
     - Unhandled context cancellation leading to potential resource leaks
     - These issues affect core functionality modules (schema, generics, finisher_api)
   - The build succeeded but with warnings about fundamental synchronization problems

The environment configuration fails because while the test suites execute, the core functionality has serious concurrency and resource management issues that would prevent normal usage of the main modules. The vetting errors indicate fundamental problems that would affect API stability and reliability.
