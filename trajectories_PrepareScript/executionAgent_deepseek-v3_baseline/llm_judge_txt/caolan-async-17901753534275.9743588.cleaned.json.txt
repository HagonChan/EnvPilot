FAILED

The environment configuration has failed to meet the success criteria for the following reasons:

1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**: 
- No test suite was able to execute successfully. The agent attempted multiple Dockerfile configurations but consistently encountered errors when trying to build and start the container ("failed to start container for image caolan-async-1790_image:executionagent").
- The testing framework (Mocha/Karma) was never successfully initialized or executed, as the environment setup never progressed past the Docker container creation phase.

2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**:
- Core modules were never verified as the environment setup failed before reaching the dependency installation or module import stage.
- The project dependencies (npm packages) were never successfully installed due to the container creation failures.
- Basic API functionality was never tested as the environment was never properly configured.

Key failure points:
- All Dockerfile attempts failed to create a functional container
- The system prevented direct execution of npm commands outside of Docker
- The setup script approach was blocked by system restrictions
- No successful installation or execution of any project code occurred

The agent exhausted multiple configuration approaches (different base images, simplified Dockerfiles, installation scripts) but was unable to establish a working environment where either testing or core functionality could be verified.
