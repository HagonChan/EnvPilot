FAILED
Detailed reasoning:
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): Failed - The output shows an empty execution attempt array ("ExecutionAgent_attempt": []), indicating no test suite was executed at all. There is no evidence of any test suite starting, executing, or finishing successfully.

2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): Failed - With no execution attempts recorded, there is no evidence that core functional modules can be imported or used normally. The empty trajectory provides no information about API functionality or core feature demonstration.

The complete lack of execution attempts means neither of the two required success conditions was met. The agent either didn't attempt any configuration or failed before reaching any meaningful execution stage.
