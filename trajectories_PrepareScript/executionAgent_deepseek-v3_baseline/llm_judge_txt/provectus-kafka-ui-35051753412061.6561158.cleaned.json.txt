FAILED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - There is no evidence that any test suite was executed or completed. The agent only read the README.md and pom.xml files but did not run any tests or verify test suite execution.
2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - There is no demonstration that core functional modules can be imported or used normally. The agent did not attempt to run any core functionality or verify basic API calls. The output only shows file reading operations without any actual execution of the application or its components.

The agent's actions were limited to reading configuration files and did not progress to actually testing or running the application, therefore failing both success criteria.
