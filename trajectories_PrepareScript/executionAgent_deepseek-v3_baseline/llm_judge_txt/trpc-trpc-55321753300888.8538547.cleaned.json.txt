FAILED
1. Test Suite Execution: There is no evidence that any test suite was executed or completed successfully. The agent's attempts were limited to setting up the environment (Docker container, npm install) but didn't reach the stage of running tests.
2. Core Functionality Verification: The core functionality was not verified. While pnpm was installed, the initial npm install failed due to missing pnpm, and there's no indication that the main modules were imported or API calls were tested. The environment setup wasn't completed successfully enough to reach this verification stage.
3. The agent didn't demonstrate either of the two required success criteria (test suite completion or core functionality verification). The setup process was interrupted by dependency issues and didn't progress far enough to validate the system's operational state.
