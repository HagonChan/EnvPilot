PASSED
1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite `flattests` was successfully executed with the output "ALL TESTS PASSED", indicating that at least one complete test suite started, executed, and finished successfully. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.
2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The build process completed successfully with targets like `flatc`, `flatbuffers`, and `flattests` being built, and the test suite passing confirms that core functionality is working as expected. This meets Condition 2 of the success criteria.

The environment configuration is successful as both conditions are satisfied: the test suite completed execution and core functionality was verified.
