FAILED

1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**: The agent failed to execute any test suite. Multiple attempts to build and run a Docker container were unsuccessful due to network issues (failed to pull Node.js base images) and dependency installation failures (npm/pnpm install errors). No test execution was ever achieved.

2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**: The agent couldn't verify core functionality because:
   - No dependencies were successfully installed (npm/pnpm install consistently failed)
   - No container environment was established where modules could be imported or APIs tested
   - The system restrictions prevented direct execution of test commands outside a container

The environment configuration failed because:
- No test suite could start or complete
- Core modules were never loaded/verified due to dependency installation failures
- The agent exhausted its attempts without achieving basic operational status
- Network/Docker configuration issues prevented proper environment setup

Critical failures occurred at both the infrastructure level (Docker/network) and dependency management level, preventing either success criterion from being met.
