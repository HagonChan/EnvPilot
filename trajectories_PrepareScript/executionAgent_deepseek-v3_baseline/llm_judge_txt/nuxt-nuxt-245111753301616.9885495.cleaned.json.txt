FAILED

1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):
- The test suite failed to execute properly due to a module not found error for '@nuxt/kit/dist/index.mjs'
- The test command sequence ('pnpm test') encountered a critical error during startup, preventing any test suite from completing
- The error indicates a fundamental dependency resolution issue in the test environment setup

2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):
- While some dependencies were successfully installed (pnpm, vue-tsc), the environment encountered multiple unresolved issues:
  - Dependency installation processes frequently hung or required termination
  - Peer dependency warnings remained unresolved (vue-tsc version mismatch)
  - File system navigation commands failed to complete, preventing verification of core functionality
- The agent was unable to verify basic module imports or API functionality due to these unresolved issues

3. Overall Assessment:
- Neither of the two success criteria was fully met
- The environment configuration process encountered multiple critical failures:
  - Dependency resolution failures
  - Test suite execution failures
  - File system access issues
  - Installation process hangs
- The agent exceeded reasonable effort limits without achieving basic functionality
