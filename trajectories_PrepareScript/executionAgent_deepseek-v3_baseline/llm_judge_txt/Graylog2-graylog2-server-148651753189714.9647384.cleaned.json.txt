FAILED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The agent was unable to successfully execute any test suite. The Maven build process consistently failed with errors related to missing 'tools.jar' and incompatible Java versions. Despite multiple attempts to install and configure the correct Java version (OpenJDK 17), the build process did not complete successfully, preventing any test suite from running.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The agent did not reach a stage where core functionality could be verified. The build failures prevented the project from being compiled and installed, which is a prerequisite for importing and using core modules or making basic API calls. The environment configuration was not completed successfully to allow any functional verification.

The agent exhausted multiple attempts to resolve the Java version and build tool issues but was ultimately unsuccessful in creating a working environment where either test execution or core functionality verification could be performed. The persistent 'tools.jar' issue indicates a fundamental problem with the Java development kit installation that wasn't resolved within the agent's execution scope.
