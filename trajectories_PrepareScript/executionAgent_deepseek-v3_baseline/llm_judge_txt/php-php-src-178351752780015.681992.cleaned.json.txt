FAILED
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): Not met - There is no evidence that any test suite was executed. The Dockerfile was created and the environment was set up, but no test commands were run.
2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): Not met - There is no evidence that core modules were imported or basic API calls were tested. The setup only reached the stage of cloning the repository and installing dependencies, but no actual PHP functionality was verified.

The agent successfully set up a Docker environment and installed necessary dependencies, but did not progress far enough to execute any tests or verify core functionality. The process stopped at the environment preparation stage without reaching the actual testing or verification phases required for success.
