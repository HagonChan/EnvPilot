FAILED
Detailed reasoning:
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): Failed - The output shows an empty execution attempt list ("ExecutionAgent_attempt": []), indicating no test suite was even attempted to be executed. There is no evidence of any test suite starting, executing, or finishing successfully.

2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): Failed - With no execution attempts recorded, there is no evidence that core functional modules can be imported or used normally. The complete lack of any execution trajectory means we cannot verify any basic API calls or core features.

The empty execution record suggests the Agent either failed before attempting any configuration steps or encountered a critical error that prevented any execution attempts. Without any execution attempts, neither of the two success criteria can be satisfied.
