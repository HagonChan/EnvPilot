1. Test Suite Execution: The test suite was successfully executed with the command 'go run build.go test', which ran multiple test packages (e.g., internal/db, lib/api, lib/config) and reported 'ok' for all of them. This confirms that the test suite completed successfully, meeting Condition 1.
2. Core Functionality Verification: The core functionality was verified by building and installing the project ('go run build.go install'), and then checking the version of the Syncthing binary ('./bin/syncthing version'), which returned the expected version information. This confirms that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally, meeting Condition 2.
