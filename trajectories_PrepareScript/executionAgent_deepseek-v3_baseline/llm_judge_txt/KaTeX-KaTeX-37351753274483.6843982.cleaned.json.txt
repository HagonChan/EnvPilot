FAILED

1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**: The agent was unable to successfully build a Docker image due to persistent network connectivity issues with Docker's proxy. This prevented the execution of any test suite (`yarn test`), as the environment could not be properly configured. The test suite execution is a critical success criterion that was not met.

2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**: Since the Docker image could not be built and the environment was not set up, the core functionality of the project (e.g., importing and using main modules, executing basic API calls) could not be verified. The agent did not reach a stage where core functionality could be tested.

**Additional Notes**:
- The agent made multiple attempts to resolve the Docker network issues by trying different base images (Node.js, Ubuntu, Alpine) but was unsuccessful each time due to the same proxy connectivity problem.
- The agent also attempted to bypass Docker by running commands directly in the terminal, but this was restricted by the environment's limitations.
- Without a functional environment, neither the test suite nor core functionality could be validated, resulting in a failed configuration.
