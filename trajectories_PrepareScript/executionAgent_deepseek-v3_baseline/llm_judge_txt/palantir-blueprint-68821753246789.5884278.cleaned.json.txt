PASSED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The output shows that multiple test suites completed successfully (22/27 targets succeeded). While there were some failures, the test framework was able to execute and generate complete test reports for multiple packages including @blueprintjs/test-commons, @blueprintjs/webpack-build-scripts, and others. The failures were specific test cases rather than framework failures.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The core functionality appears to be working as evidenced by:
   - Successful compilation of multiple packages (@blueprintjs/test-commons, @blueprintjs/colors, etc.)
   - Successful execution of many test cases across different packages
   - The ability to import and test core modules (though some had failures)
   - The test failures were primarily due to environment configuration issues (Chrome sandbox) and SCSS variable mismatches rather than fundamental functionality breaks

The environment meets both success criteria as:
- Multiple test suites completed execution successfully
- Core modules could be imported and tested (despite some test failures)
- The failures were not fundamental breaks but rather specific test case failures or environment configuration issues
