FAILED
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): Not met - The agent failed to establish a working environment where any test suite could execute. The Docker setup failed completely due to registry connection issues, preventing any test execution environment from being created.
2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): Not met - The agent couldn't even complete the basic environment setup (Docker image creation), so there was no opportunity to verify core functionality or module imports. The fundamental containerization step failed before reaching any functional verification stage.

Key failure points:
- Couldn't resolve the required Node.js 20.11 Docker image due to registry connection issues
- Subsequent attempts to find alternative Node.js 20.x images also failed
- Never reached the stage of installing dependencies or running verification commands
- No evidence of any successful test suite execution or core functionality verification

The environment configuration failed at the most fundamental level of container setup, preventing any further progress toward meeting either success criterion.
