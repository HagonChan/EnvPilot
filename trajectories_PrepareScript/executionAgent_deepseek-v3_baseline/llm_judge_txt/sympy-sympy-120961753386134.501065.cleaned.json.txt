FAILED

1. Test Suite Execution: The agent's output does not show any attempt to run the test suite (via `setup.py test` or similar). While the setup.py file clearly defines test commands, there's no evidence these were executed. Without test suite execution, we cannot verify Condition 1.

2. Core Functionality Verification: While the environment was set up and SymPy was installed in editable mode, there's no demonstration of core functionality verification. No Python interpreter session or script execution was shown to confirm basic imports or API functionality. The mpmath dependency was confirmed, but this alone doesn't satisfy Condition 2.

The agent successfully completed initial setup steps (Docker environment creation and package installation) but didn't progress to the critical verification stages required by the success criteria. The absence of both test suite execution and core functionality verification means neither condition was met.
