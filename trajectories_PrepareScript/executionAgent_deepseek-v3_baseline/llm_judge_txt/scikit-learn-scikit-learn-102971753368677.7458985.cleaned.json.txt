FAILED

Detailed reasoning:
1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):
- The agent was unable to successfully execute any test suite for scikit-learn. Multiple attempts to run `pytest sklearn` failed with ImportError indicating the package wasn't built correctly.
- The testing framework never generated a complete test report structure as the tests couldn't even start due to build issues.

2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):
- While the project was installed in editable mode (`pip install -e .`), core modules couldn't be imported properly as evidenced by the persistent ImportError about missing `sklearn.__check_build._check_build`.
- Basic API calls couldn't be verified since the test suite couldn't run and no manual verification of core functionality was demonstrated.

Additional failure indicators:
- The Docker build process failed multiple times before finally succeeding in creating a container, but the installation inside the container still had issues.
- The agent exceeded the maximum call limit (as evidenced by the repeated attempts) without achieving basic functionality.
- Despite successfully building with meson/ninja, the Python package still couldn't be properly imported for testing.

The environment configuration ultimately failed to meet either of the two success criteria, with both test execution and core functionality verification remaining unresolved.
