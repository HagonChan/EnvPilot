FAILED
Detailed reasoning:
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): Failed - The output shows an empty "ExecutionAgent_attempt" array, indicating no test suite was executed at all. There is no evidence of any test suite starting, executing, or finishing successfully.

2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): Failed - With no execution attempts recorded, there is no evidence that core functional modules can be imported or used normally. The empty output provides no indication that basic API calls work or core features are functional.

The agent appears to have not made any execution attempts whatsoever, which means neither of the two success criteria could be met. Without any test suite execution or functionality verification attempts, the environment configuration cannot be considered successful.
