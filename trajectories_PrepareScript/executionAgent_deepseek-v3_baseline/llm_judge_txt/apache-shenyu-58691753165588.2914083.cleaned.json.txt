PASSED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The output shows multiple test suites executed successfully with reports like "Tests run: 18, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0" and "BUILD SUCCESS". The testing framework generated complete test reports and all modules passed their tests.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The successful build and test execution indicates core modules can be imported and used. The project built all components including admin, bootstrap, and various plugins which demonstrates core functionality is operational. The Maven build process completed successfully which requires all dependencies to resolve correctly.

The environment configuration meets both success criteria as:
- Multiple test suites completed execution successfully with full reports
- Core components built successfully and would be importable/usable
- No critical failures in building or testing the main components
- The agent successfully set up a working Docker environment and executed the build/test process to completion
