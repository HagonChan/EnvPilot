PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The output shows that all 14 projects within the monorepo successfully passed their tests, completing in 1 minute. The test suite executed without failures, generating a complete test report structure as evidenced by the successful execution of 'npm test' and the creation of TEST_RESULTS.txt.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The successful build and test execution indicate that the core functional modules can be imported and used normally. The project's main components were built successfully ('npm run build'), and the test suite verified that basic API calls and core features are functioning as expected. The test results confirm that the core functionality is operational.

The environment configuration meets both success criteria: the test suite completed successfully and core functionality was verified. While there were some warnings about legacy cache configuration and vulnerabilities in dependencies, these did not prevent the successful execution of tests or core functionality verification.
