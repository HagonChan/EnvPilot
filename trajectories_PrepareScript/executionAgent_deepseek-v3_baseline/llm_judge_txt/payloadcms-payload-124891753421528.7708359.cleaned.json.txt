FAILED

1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**: The agent was unable to successfully execute any test suite. Multiple attempts to create and run a Dockerfile failed with errors like "failed to start container" and timeout issues when trying to fetch the Docker server API version. The test commands (`pnpm test`) were never successfully executed within a container or directly in the environment.

2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**: The agent could not verify core functionality as it was unable to complete the basic setup steps. The project dependencies were never successfully installed and built due to the Docker containerization failures. No core modules were imported or tested.

The environment configuration failed because:
- No test suite could be executed to completion
- Core functionality was never verified due to setup failures
- The agent exceeded maximum attempts without achieving basic operational status
- Docker containerization attempts consistently failed, preventing any meaningful execution of the project

The repeated Docker errors suggest either a fundamental issue with the Docker setup in the execution environment or incompatibility between the Docker configuration and the project requirements. Without successful containerization or alternative setup method, neither of the two success criteria could be met.
