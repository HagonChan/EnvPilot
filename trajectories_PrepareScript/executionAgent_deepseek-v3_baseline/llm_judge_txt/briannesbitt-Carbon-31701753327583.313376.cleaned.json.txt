FAILED

1. Test Suite Execution: The agent was unable to execute any test suite. While the Docker container was successfully built and started, the agent couldn't proceed with running the tests due to restrictions on direct docker command execution. The test command specified in the Dockerfile ("composer test") was never executed.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The agent couldn't verify core functionality because:
   - The composer install command was never successfully executed inside the container
   - No PHP modules or core functionality were verified to be working
   - The verification scripts created (check_extensions.php, verify_environment.php) were never successfully executed

The main obstacles were:
- The system's restriction on direct docker command execution prevented necessary setup steps
- The agent couldn't modify the Dockerfile after container creation to add verification steps
- The verification scripts couldn't be executed due to file location/permission issues

Neither of the two success criteria (test suite execution and core functionality verification) were met, resulting in a failed configuration attempt.
