FAILED

1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**: The agent was unable to execute any test suite. The primary obstacle was the inability to set up the environment due to Docker image build failures caused by DNS resolution issues (`http.docker.internal` lookup failures). Without a functional Docker container, the agent couldn't proceed to install dependencies (`npm install`) or run tests (`npm test` or any `test:e2e` scripts). No test suite was started or completed.

2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**: The agent couldn't verify core functionality because the environment setup failed at the Docker level. The project's main modules couldn't be imported or tested since the Node.js environment was never properly initialized. Basic API calls or example code execution was impossible without the dependencies being installed.

**Root Cause**: The environment configuration failed due to persistent Docker registry connectivity issues, preventing the agent from pulling the required Node.js image (`node:14`, `node:lts`, etc.). This blocked all subsequent steps, including dependency installation and test execution. The agent exhausted all attempts to resolve this (trying different image tags, DNS overrides, and alternative registries) without success. 

**Note**: Even if some tests were to fail, the agent never reached the stage where tests could be executed or core functionality verified. The environment setup itself was incomplete, making this a clear failure of both success criteria.
