FAILED

1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - Not met
- No test suite was executed successfully. The environment setup failed before reaching the test execution phase due to dependency and build system issues.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - Not met
- The core functionality was never verified as the build process failed at multiple stages:
   - Meson version incompatibility (required >=1.3.0 but only 0.61.2 available)
   - Failed to install pip due to repository access issues
   - Never successfully compiled or installed the mpv player

3. Critical Failures:
- Build system requirements not met (meson version too old)
- Package installation failures due to repository issues
- Never reached a state where core functionality could be verified
- No successful compilation or installation of the software

4. Execution Limitations:
- Multiple attempts to resolve dependencies were made but failed
- Network/repository issues prevented package installation
- Build system version requirements couldn't be satisfied
- Agent reached maximum call limit without achieving basic functionality

The environment configuration did not meet either success criteria due to fundamental build system and dependency issues that prevented the project from being properly compiled or tested.
