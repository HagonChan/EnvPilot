FAILED

1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**: The agent was unable to execute any test suite. The primary obstacle was the failure to build a Docker container due to persistent network/DNS issues when trying to pull base images (node:18, alpine:latest). Without a functional container, no test commands (like `npm test`) could be executed, and thus no test suite was run or completed.

2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**: The agent couldn't verify core functionality because:
   - The environment setup was incomplete (no successful Docker build)
   - No Node.js commands could be executed outside Docker due to restrictions
   - The project's modules were never imported or tested in a working environment

The root cause appears to be network/DNS configuration issues preventing Docker from accessing required base images. Without overcoming this fundamental infrastructure problem, neither testing nor core functionality verification was possible. The agent exhausted its attempts without achieving either success condition.
