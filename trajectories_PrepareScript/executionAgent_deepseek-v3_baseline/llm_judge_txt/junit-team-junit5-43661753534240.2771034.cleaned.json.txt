FAILED
Detailed reasoning:
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): Failed - The execution attempt array is empty, indicating no test suite was even attempted to run. There is no evidence of any test suite starting, executing, or finishing successfully.
2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): Failed - With no execution attempts recorded, there is no evidence that core modules can be imported or used normally. No API calls or example code executions were demonstrated.

The empty execution attempt array suggests the agent either didn't attempt any configuration steps or failed before reaching any meaningful execution phase. Without any positive signals in either criterion, the environment configuration must be considered a failure.
