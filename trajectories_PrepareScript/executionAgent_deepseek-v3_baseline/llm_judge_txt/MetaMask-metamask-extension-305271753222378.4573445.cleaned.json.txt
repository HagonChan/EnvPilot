FAILED
1. Test Suite Execution: The agent did not successfully execute any test suite. The output shows attempts to configure the environment via Docker but fails at the initial setup stage (git installation and Docker image building). There's no evidence of any test suite being executed or completing.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The agent never reached the stage of verifying core functionality. The process failed during environment setup (Docker configuration) before any module imports or API calls could be tested. The package.json was read successfully, but this alone doesn't demonstrate core functionality.

The configuration failed at the most basic level of environment setup (Docker container creation) and never progressed to either test execution or core functionality verification. Both success criteria remain unmet.
