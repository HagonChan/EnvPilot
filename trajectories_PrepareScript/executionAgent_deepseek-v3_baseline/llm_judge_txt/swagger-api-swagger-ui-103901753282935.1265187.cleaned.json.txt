FAILED

1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The agent was unable to successfully build and start a Docker container, which is a prerequisite for running any test suites. Multiple attempts to create and run a Docker image failed with various errors, primarily related to network connectivity issues when trying to pull base images and container startup failures. No test suite was executed or completed.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - While the project files (package.json, Dockerfile) were successfully read, the core functionality could not be verified because:
   - The Docker container never successfully started
   - No npm commands could be executed in the restricted environment
   - The built assets in the dist/ directory were present but couldn't be served or tested

The environment configuration failed because:
- The Docker setup was never successful due to network/configuration issues
- No test suite could be executed
- Core functionality couldn't be verified due to container startup failures
- The agent exhausted its attempts without achieving either success condition

The presence of built assets in the dist/ directory suggests the build process might work if the Docker environment could be properly configured, but this wasn't sufficient to meet the success criteria.
