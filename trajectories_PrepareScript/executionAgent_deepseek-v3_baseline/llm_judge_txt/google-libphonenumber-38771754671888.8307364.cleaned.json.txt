PASSED

Detailed Reasoning:
1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):
- Multiple test suites were successfully executed across different modules (common library, C++ build tools, data tools, etc.)
- Test reports were generated showing all tests passed (0 failures, 0 errors)
- Example: Common library tests (77 tests), C++ build tools (9 tests), Data tools (14 tests) all completed successfully
- The test framework generated complete reports with counts of passed tests

2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):
- The project successfully built all modules including core components (libphonenumber, prefixmapper, carrier, geocoder)
- Maven build process completed without critical errors
- All dependencies were resolved and installed correctly
- The demo module (war packaging) was successfully built indicating core web functionality works

3. Additional Observations:
- The agent successfully configured the environment by:
  - Creating a Docker container with Maven and OpenJDK 17
  - Installing required dependencies (protobuf-compiler)
  - Resolving build issues
- While there were some Javadoc generation warnings, these don't affect core functionality
- The build and test process completed end-to-end demonstrating the environment is properly configured

Both success criteria are fully met - test suites executed completely and core functionality is verified through successful builds and test executions.
