FAILED
1. Test Suite Execution: The configuration process did not reach a point where any test suite could be executed. The CMake configuration failed due to missing dependencies (OpenSSL, GSL, Python3, etc.), preventing the build from completing. Without a successful build, no test suite could be started or completed.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The core functionality of the ROOT project could not be verified because the build process did not complete successfully. The CMake configuration failed multiple times due to missing dependencies, and the final error indicates that OpenSSL was not found, which is critical for the project. Without a successful build, the core modules could not be imported or tested.

The environment configuration did not meet either of the success criteria. The process encountered multiple dependency issues that prevented the build from completing, and no test suite was executed or core functionality verified.
