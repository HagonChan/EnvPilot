PASSED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The 'make test' command was successfully executed with all tests passing across various packages. The test suite completed successfully, generating test reports and showing execution times for different test packages. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The project was successfully built using 'make build', generating binaries for prometheus and promtool. Core modules could be imported and used normally, as evidenced by the successful test execution. The main functional modules were verified through the test suite execution, demonstrating basic API functionality and core features.

While there were initial issues with Node.js version mismatch and missing goyacc dependency, these were resolved during the configuration process. The final test execution showed all tests passing, confirming both core functionality and test suite execution capabilities. The environment configuration was completed successfully within the maximum call limit.
