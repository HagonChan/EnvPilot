FAILED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The agent did not successfully execute any test suite. The process was interrupted multiple times during the setup, and the build process was never completed to the point where tests could be run. The git checkout for the specific commit also failed, preventing the correct version of the code from being tested.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The core functionality was not verified. The build process was not completed, and there was no evidence that main functional modules could be imported or used normally. The agent encountered multiple issues during the setup, including failed git checkouts and stuck terminal sessions, which prevented the verification of core functionality.

The agent exceeded the maximum call limit without achieving basic functionality, and no test suite could complete execution. The environment configuration was not successful.
