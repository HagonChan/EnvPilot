FAILED

Detailed Reasoning:

1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):
- The agent attempted multiple times to run `mvn install` but consistently failed during the compilation phase with the error "tools.jar not found"
- No test suite was ever successfully executed to completion
- The build process failed before reaching any test execution phase
- Multiple JDK installations and configurations were attempted but none resolved the compilation error

2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):
- The main Graylog project failed to compile, meaning core modules were never built
- No evidence that any core functionality could be imported or used
- The agent couldn't progress beyond the compilation failure to verify any API calls or features
- Basic project structure was examined (pom.xml) but actual functionality was never tested

3. Failure Conditions Met:
- Testing framework (Maven) could not execute normally due to compilation failures
- Core modules could not be compiled, making them fundamentally unavailable
- Agent exhausted multiple configuration attempts without achieving basic functionality
- The fundamental tools.jar dependency issue was never resolved

The environment configuration was unsuccessful because neither of the two success criteria were met - no test suite completed and no core functionality could be verified due to persistent compilation failures. The agent made multiple reasonable attempts to configure the environment but was ultimately unable to resolve the JDK/tools.jar dependency issue that prevented successful compilation.
