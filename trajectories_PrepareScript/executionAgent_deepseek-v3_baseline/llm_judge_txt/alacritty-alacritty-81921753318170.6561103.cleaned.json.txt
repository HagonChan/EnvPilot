PASSED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The output shows that all test suites completed successfully with 79 tests in src/main.rs, 1 test in src/lib.rs for alacritty_config, 7 tests in config.rs, 132 tests in alacritty_terminal, and 44 tests in ref.rs all passing. The test framework generated complete test reports for each suite.
2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The successful build with `cargo build --release` and subsequent test execution demonstrates that core modules can be imported and used normally. The compilation of all components (alacritty, alacritty_terminal, alacritty_config, etc.) shows basic API functionality is working as expected.
3. The environment configuration meets both success criteria: test suites completed successfully and core functionality was verified through both compilation and test execution. All 263 tests across multiple test suites passed, confirming operational framework and core functionality.
