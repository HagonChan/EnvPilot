FAILED

1. Test Suite Execution: The agent did not successfully execute any test suite for the OBS Studio project. The configuration process encountered multiple dependency issues, particularly with FFmpeg version requirements (needed 6.1 but found 4.4.2), and the build process was never completed to the point where tests could be run.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The core functionality of OBS Studio could not be verified because the build process failed during configuration due to unmet dependencies (specifically FFmpeg version mismatch). The agent made multiple attempts to resolve this but was ultimately unsuccessful in installing the correct FFmpeg version.

Key failure points:
- FFmpeg version 4.4.2 installed when 6.1+ was required
- Build configuration failed before compilation could begin
- No test suite was executed
- Core modules were never built or verified

The environment configuration did not meet either of the two success criteria required for a PASSED evaluation.
