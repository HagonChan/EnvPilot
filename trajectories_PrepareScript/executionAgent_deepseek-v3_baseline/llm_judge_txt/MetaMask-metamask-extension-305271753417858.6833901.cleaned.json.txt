FAILED
1. Test Suite Execution: The test suite did not complete successfully. The initial attempt to run 'yarn test' failed due to a JavaScript heap out of memory error. While the second attempt with increased heap size showed progress in checking file formatting, it did not complete execution of the actual test suite before being terminated. No test report structure was generated.

2. Core Functionality Verification: There is no evidence that core functional modules were imported or tested. The agent's attempts were primarily focused on environment setup and dependency installation, but did not demonstrate any successful execution of core functionality or API calls.

The environment configuration process encountered critical issues:
- Memory constraints prevented test execution
- No verification of core module functionality was performed
- The process was terminated before completing test suite execution

While dependencies were successfully installed, neither of the two success criteria (test suite completion and core functionality verification) were met. The memory issues and incomplete test execution represent fundamental failures in the environment configuration process.
