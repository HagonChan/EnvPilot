Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\n- xcodebuild\n- msbuild\n- gradle\n- bazel\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: C++ 11 and newer\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - g++-13\n  - clang++-18\n  - cmake\n  - make\n  - xcodebuild\n  - msbuild\n  - gradle\n  - bazel\n  - Java\n  - Python\n  - Rust\n  - Swift\n  - TypeScript\n  - Dart\n  - Nim\n  - PHP\n  - Go\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake failed to detect a C++ compiler after installation\n    - Solution: The C++ compiler (g++) was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for compiling C++ code in CMake-based projects. The root cause was a missing compiler package, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler. The solution was to install g++ using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed during project build due to missing g++ compiler\n    - Solution: The build process required the g++ compiler for compiling C++ source files, which was not installed in the Ubuntu environment. The root cause was an incomplete build dependency setup, as g++ was not included in the initial package installation. The solution was to install the g++ package using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The cmake command failed when configuring the project due to missing installation.\n    - Solution: CMake was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for building projects configured with CMake. The root cause was a missing build tool package in the environment configuration. The solution was to update the package index and install CMake using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The clang++ compiler was unavailable for C++ compilation\n    - Solution: The project required clang++ for compilation, but the compiler was not installed. The root cause was a missing C++ toolchain package. The solution was to install the Clang compiler suite.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y clang\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\n- xcodebuild\n- msbuild\n- gradle\n- bazel\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: C++ 11 and newer\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - g++-13\n  - clang++-18\n  - cmake\n  - make\n  - xcodebuild\n  - msbuild\n  - gradle\n  - bazel\n  - Java\n  - Python\n  - Rust\n  - Swift\n  - TypeScript\n  - Dart\n  - Nim\n  - PHP\n  - Go\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake failed to detect a C++ compiler after installation\n    - Solution: The C++ compiler (g++) was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for compiling C++ code in CMake-based projects. The root cause was a missing compiler package, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler. The solution was to install g++ using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed during project build due to missing g++ compiler\n    - Solution: The build process required the g++ compiler for compiling C++ source files, which was not installed in the Ubuntu environment. The root cause was an incomplete build dependency setup, as g++ was not included in the initial package installation. The solution was to install the g++ package using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The cmake command failed when configuring the project due to missing installation.\n    - Solution: CMake was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for building projects configured with CMake. The root cause was a missing build tool package in the environment configuration. The solution was to update the package index and install CMake using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The clang++ compiler was unavailable for C++ compilation\n    - Solution: The project required clang++ for compilation, but the compiler was not installed. The root cause was a missing C++ toolchain package. The solution was to install the Clang compiler suite.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y clang\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\n- xcodebuild\n- msbuild\n- gradle\n- bazel\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: C++ 11 and newer\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - g++-13\n  - clang++-18\n  - cmake\n  - make\n  - xcodebuild\n  - msbuild\n  - gradle\n  - bazel\n  - Java\n  - Python\n  - Rust\n  - Swift\n  - TypeScript\n  - Dart\n  - Nim\n  - PHP\n  - Go\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake failed to detect a C++ compiler after installation\n    - Solution: The C++ compiler (g++) was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for compiling C++ code in CMake-based projects. The root cause was a missing compiler package, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler. The solution was to install g++ using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed during project build due to missing g++ compiler\n    - Solution: The build process required the g++ compiler for compiling C++ source files, which was not installed in the Ubuntu environment. The root cause was an incomplete build dependency setup, as g++ was not included in the initial package installation. The solution was to install the g++ package using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The cmake command failed when configuring the project due to missing installation.\n    - Solution: CMake was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for building projects configured with CMake. The root cause was a missing build tool package in the environment configuration. The solution was to update the package index and install CMake using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The clang++ compiler was unavailable for C++ compilation\n    - Solution: The project required clang++ for compilation, but the compiler was not installed. The root cause was a missing C++ toolchain package. The solution was to install the Clang compiler suite.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y clang\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\n- xcodebuild\n- msbuild\n- gradle\n- bazel\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: C++ 11 and newer\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - g++-13\n  - clang++-18\n  - cmake\n  - make\n  - xcodebuild\n  - msbuild\n  - gradle\n  - bazel\n  - Java\n  - Python\n  - Rust\n  - Swift\n  - TypeScript\n  - Dart\n  - Nim\n  - PHP\n  - Go\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake failed to detect a C++ compiler after installation\n    - Solution: The C++ compiler (g++) was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for compiling C++ code in CMake-based projects. The root cause was a missing compiler package, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler. The solution was to install g++ using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed during project build due to missing g++ compiler\n    - Solution: The build process required the g++ compiler for compiling C++ source files, which was not installed in the Ubuntu environment. The root cause was an incomplete build dependency setup, as g++ was not included in the initial package installation. The solution was to install the g++ package using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The cmake command failed when configuring the project due to missing installation.\n    - Solution: CMake was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for building projects configured with CMake. The root cause was a missing build tool package in the environment configuration. The solution was to update the package index and install CMake using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The clang++ compiler was unavailable for C++ compilation\n    - Solution: The project required clang++ for compilation, but the compiler was not installed. The root cause was a missing C++ toolchain package. The solution was to install the Clang compiler suite.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y clang\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\n- xcodebuild\n- msbuild\n- gradle\n- bazel\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: C++ 11 and newer\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - g++-13\n  - clang++-18\n  - cmake\n  - make\n  - xcodebuild\n  - msbuild\n  - gradle\n  - bazel\n  - Java\n  - Python\n  - Rust\n  - Swift\n  - TypeScript\n  - Dart\n  - Nim\n  - PHP\n  - Go\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake failed to detect a C++ compiler after installation\n    - Solution: The C++ compiler (g++) was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for compiling C++ code in CMake-based projects. The root cause was a missing compiler package, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler. The solution was to install g++ using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed during project build due to missing g++ compiler\n    - Solution: The build process required the g++ compiler for compiling C++ source files, which was not installed in the Ubuntu environment. The root cause was an incomplete build dependency setup, as g++ was not included in the initial package installation. The solution was to install the g++ package using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The cmake command failed when configuring the project due to missing installation.\n    - Solution: CMake was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for building projects configured with CMake. The root cause was a missing build tool package in the environment configuration. The solution was to update the package index and install CMake using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The clang++ compiler was unavailable for C++ compilation\n    - Solution: The project required clang++ for compilation, but the compiler was not installed. The root cause was a missing C++ toolchain package. The solution was to install the Clang compiler suite.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y clang\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\n- xcodebuild\n- msbuild\n- gradle\n- bazel\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: C++ 11 and newer\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - g++-13\n  - clang++-18\n  - cmake\n  - make\n  - xcodebuild\n  - msbuild\n  - gradle\n  - bazel\n  - Java\n  - Python\n  - Rust\n  - Swift\n  - TypeScript\n  - Dart\n  - Nim\n  - PHP\n  - Go\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake failed to detect a C++ compiler after installation\n    - Solution: The C++ compiler (g++) was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for compiling C++ code in CMake-based projects. The root cause was a missing compiler package, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler. The solution was to install g++ using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed during project build due to missing g++ compiler\n    - Solution: The build process required the g++ compiler for compiling C++ source files, which was not installed in the Ubuntu environment. The root cause was an incomplete build dependency setup, as g++ was not included in the initial package installation. The solution was to install the g++ package using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The cmake command failed when configuring the project due to missing installation.\n    - Solution: CMake was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for building projects configured with CMake. The root cause was a missing build tool package in the environment configuration. The solution was to update the package index and install CMake using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The clang++ compiler was unavailable for C++ compilation\n    - Solution: The project required clang++ for compilation, but the compiler was not installed. The root cause was a missing C++ toolchain package. The solution was to install the Clang compiler suite.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y clang\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\n- xcodebuild\n- msbuild\n- gradle\n- bazel\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: C++ 11 and newer\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - g++-13\n  - clang++-18\n  - cmake\n  - make\n  - xcodebuild\n  - msbuild\n  - gradle\n  - bazel\n  - Java\n  - Python\n  - Rust\n  - Swift\n  - TypeScript\n  - Dart\n  - Nim\n  - PHP\n  - Go\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake failed to detect a C++ compiler after installation\n    - Solution: The C++ compiler (g++) was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for compiling C++ code in CMake-based projects. The root cause was a missing compiler package, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler. The solution was to install g++ using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed during project build due to missing g++ compiler\n    - Solution: The build process required the g++ compiler for compiling C++ source files, which was not installed in the Ubuntu environment. The root cause was an incomplete build dependency setup, as g++ was not included in the initial package installation. The solution was to install the g++ package using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The cmake command failed when configuring the project due to missing installation.\n    - Solution: CMake was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for building projects configured with CMake. The root cause was a missing build tool package in the environment configuration. The solution was to update the package index and install CMake using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The clang++ compiler was unavailable for C++ compilation\n    - Solution: The project required clang++ for compilation, but the compiler was not installed. The root cause was a missing C++ toolchain package. The solution was to install the Clang compiler suite.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y clang\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\n- xcodebuild\n- msbuild\n- gradle\n- bazel\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: C++ 11 and newer\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - g++-13\n  - clang++-18\n  - cmake\n  - make\n  - xcodebuild\n  - msbuild\n  - gradle\n  - bazel\n  - Java\n  - Python\n  - Rust\n  - Swift\n  - TypeScript\n  - Dart\n  - Nim\n  - PHP\n  - Go\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake failed to detect a C++ compiler after installation\n    - Solution: The C++ compiler (g++) was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for compiling C++ code in CMake-based projects. The root cause was a missing compiler package, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler. The solution was to install g++ using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed during project build due to missing g++ compiler\n    - Solution: The build process required the g++ compiler for compiling C++ source files, which was not installed in the Ubuntu environment. The root cause was an incomplete build dependency setup, as g++ was not included in the initial package installation. The solution was to install the g++ package using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The cmake command failed when configuring the project due to missing installation.\n    - Solution: CMake was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for building projects configured with CMake. The root cause was a missing build tool package in the environment configuration. The solution was to update the package index and install CMake using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The clang++ compiler was unavailable for C++ compilation\n    - Solution: The project required clang++ for compilation, but the compiler was not installed. The root cause was a missing C++ toolchain package. The solution was to install the Clang compiler suite.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y clang\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\n- xcodebuild\n- msbuild\n- gradle\n- bazel\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: C++ 11 and newer\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - g++-13\n  - clang++-18\n  - cmake\n  - make\n  - xcodebuild\n  - msbuild\n  - gradle\n  - bazel\n  - Java\n  - Python\n  - Rust\n  - Swift\n  - TypeScript\n  - Dart\n  - Nim\n  - PHP\n  - Go\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake failed to detect a C++ compiler after installation\n    - Solution: The C++ compiler (g++) was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for compiling C++ code in CMake-based projects. The root cause was a missing compiler package, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler. The solution was to install g++ using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed during project build due to missing g++ compiler\n    - Solution: The build process required the g++ compiler for compiling C++ source files, which was not installed in the Ubuntu environment. The root cause was an incomplete build dependency setup, as g++ was not included in the initial package installation. The solution was to install the g++ package using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The cmake command failed when configuring the project due to missing installation.\n    - Solution: CMake was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for building projects configured with CMake. The root cause was a missing build tool package in the environment configuration. The solution was to update the package index and install CMake using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The clang++ compiler was unavailable for C++ compilation\n    - Solution: The project required clang++ for compilation, but the compiler was not installed. The root cause was a missing C++ toolchain package. The solution was to install the Clang compiler suite.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y clang\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake failed to detect a C++ compiler after installation\n    - Solution: The C++ compiler (g++) was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for compiling C++ code in CMake-based projects. The root cause was a missing compiler package, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler. The solution was to install g++ using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed during project build due to missing g++ compiler\n    - Solution: The build process required the g++ compiler for compiling C++ source files, which was not installed in the Ubuntu environment. The root cause was an incomplete build dependency setup, as g++ was not included in the initial package installation. The solution was to install the g++ package using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The cmake command failed when configuring the project due to missing installation.\n    - Solution: CMake was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for building projects configured with CMake. The root cause was a missing build tool package in the environment configuration. The solution was to update the package index and install CMake using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The clang++ compiler was unavailable for C++ compilation\n    - Solution: The project required clang++ for compilation, but the compiler was not installed. The root cause was a missing C++ toolchain package. The solution was to install the Clang compiler suite.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y clang\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\n- xcodebuild\n- msbuild\n- gradle\n- bazel\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: C++ 11 and newer\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - g++-13\n  - clang++-18\n  - cmake\n  - make\n  - xcodebuild\n  - msbuild\n  - gradle\n  - bazel\n  - Java\n  - Python\n  - Rust\n  - Swift\n  - TypeScript\n  - Dart\n  - Nim\n  - PHP\n  - Go\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake failed to detect a C++ compiler after installation\n    - Solution: The C++ compiler (g++) was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for compiling C++ code in CMake-based projects. The root cause was a missing compiler package, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler. The solution was to install g++ using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed during project build due to missing g++ compiler\n    - Solution: The build process required the g++ compiler for compiling C++ source files, which was not installed in the Ubuntu environment. The root cause was an incomplete build dependency setup, as g++ was not included in the initial package installation. The solution was to install the g++ package using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The cmake command failed when configuring the project due to missing installation.\n    - Solution: CMake was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for building projects configured with CMake. The root cause was a missing build tool package in the environment configuration. The solution was to update the package index and install CMake using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The clang++ compiler was unavailable for C++ compilation\n    - Solution: The project required clang++ for compilation, but the compiler was not installed. The root cause was a missing C++ toolchain package. The solution was to install the Clang compiler suite.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y clang\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\n- xcodebuild\n- msbuild\n- gradle\n- bazel\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: C++ 11 and newer\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - g++-13\n  - clang++-18\n  - cmake\n  - make\n  - xcodebuild\n  - msbuild\n  - gradle\n  - bazel\n  - Java\n  - Python\n  - Rust\n  - Swift\n  - TypeScript\n  - Dart\n  - Nim\n  - PHP\n  - Go\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake failed to detect a C++ compiler after installation\n    - Solution: The C++ compiler (g++) was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for compiling C++ code in CMake-based projects. The root cause was a missing compiler package, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler. The solution was to install g++ using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed during project build due to missing g++ compiler\n    - Solution: The build process required the g++ compiler for compiling C++ source files, which was not installed in the Ubuntu environment. The root cause was an incomplete build dependency setup, as g++ was not included in the initial package installation. The solution was to install the g++ package using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The cmake command failed when configuring the project due to missing installation.\n    - Solution: CMake was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for building projects configured with CMake. The root cause was a missing build tool package in the environment configuration. The solution was to update the package index and install CMake using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The clang++ compiler was unavailable for C++ compilation\n    - Solution: The project required clang++ for compilation, but the compiler was not installed. The root cause was a missing C++ toolchain package. The solution was to install the Clang compiler suite.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y clang\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\n- xcodebuild\n- msbuild\n- gradle\n- bazel\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: C++ 11 and newer\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - g++-13\n  - clang++-18\n  - cmake\n  - make\n  - xcodebuild\n  - msbuild\n  - gradle\n  - bazel\n  - Java\n  - Python\n  - Rust\n  - Swift\n  - TypeScript\n  - Dart\n  - Nim\n  - PHP\n  - Go\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake failed to detect a C++ compiler after installation\n    - Solution: The C++ compiler (g++) was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for compiling C++ code in CMake-based projects. The root cause was a missing compiler package, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler. The solution was to install g++ using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed during project build due to missing g++ compiler\n    - Solution: The build process required the g++ compiler for compiling C++ source files, which was not installed in the Ubuntu environment. The root cause was an incomplete build dependency setup, as g++ was not included in the initial package installation. The solution was to install the g++ package using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The cmake command failed when configuring the project due to missing installation.\n    - Solution: CMake was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for building projects configured with CMake. The root cause was a missing build tool package in the environment configuration. The solution was to update the package index and install CMake using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The clang++ compiler was unavailable for C++ compilation\n    - Solution: The project required clang++ for compilation, but the compiler was not installed. The root cause was a missing C++ toolchain package. The solution was to install the Clang compiler suite.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y clang\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\n- xcodebuild\n- msbuild\n- gradle\n- bazel\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: C++ 11 and newer\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - g++-13\n  - clang++-18\n  - cmake\n  - make\n  - xcodebuild\n  - msbuild\n  - gradle\n  - bazel\n  - Java\n  - Python\n  - Rust\n  - Swift\n  - TypeScript\n  - Dart\n  - Nim\n  - PHP\n  - Go\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake failed to detect a C++ compiler after installation\n    - Solution: The C++ compiler (g++) was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for compiling C++ code in CMake-based projects. The root cause was a missing compiler package, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler. The solution was to install g++ using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed during project build due to missing g++ compiler\n    - Solution: The build process required the g++ compiler for compiling C++ source files, which was not installed in the Ubuntu environment. The root cause was an incomplete build dependency setup, as g++ was not included in the initial package installation. The solution was to install the g++ package using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The cmake command failed when configuring the project due to missing installation.\n    - Solution: CMake was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for building projects configured with CMake. The root cause was a missing build tool package in the environment configuration. The solution was to update the package index and install CMake using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The clang++ compiler was unavailable for C++ compilation\n    - Solution: The project required clang++ for compilation, but the compiler was not installed. The root cause was a missing C++ toolchain package. The solution was to install the Clang compiler suite.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y clang\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake failed to detect a C++ compiler after installation\n    - Solution: The C++ compiler (g++) was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for compiling C++ code in CMake-based projects. The root cause was a missing compiler package, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler. The solution was to install g++ using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed during project build due to missing g++ compiler\n    - Solution: The build process required the g++ compiler for compiling C++ source files, which was not installed in the Ubuntu environment. The root cause was an incomplete build dependency setup, as g++ was not included in the initial package installation. The solution was to install the g++ package using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The cmake command failed when configuring the project due to missing installation.\n    - Solution: CMake was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for building projects configured with CMake. The root cause was a missing build tool package in the environment configuration. The solution was to update the package index and install CMake using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The clang++ compiler was unavailable for C++ compilation\n    - Solution: The project required clang++ for compilation, but the compiler was not installed. The root cause was a missing C++ toolchain package. The solution was to install the Clang compiler suite.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y clang\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\n- xcodebuild\n- msbuild\n- gradle\n- bazel\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: C++ 11 and newer\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - g++-13\n  - clang++-18\n  - cmake\n  - make\n  - xcodebuild\n  - msbuild\n  - gradle\n  - bazel\n  - Java\n  - Python\n  - Rust\n  - Swift\n  - TypeScript\n  - Dart\n  - Nim\n  - PHP\n  - Go\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake failed to detect a C++ compiler after installation\n    - Solution: The C++ compiler (g++) was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for compiling C++ code in CMake-based projects. The root cause was a missing compiler package, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler. The solution was to install g++ using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed during project build due to missing g++ compiler\n    - Solution: The build process required the g++ compiler for compiling C++ source files, which was not installed in the Ubuntu environment. The root cause was an incomplete build dependency setup, as g++ was not included in the initial package installation. The solution was to install the g++ package using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The cmake command failed when configuring the project due to missing installation.\n    - Solution: CMake was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for building projects configured with CMake. The root cause was a missing build tool package in the environment configuration. The solution was to update the package index and install CMake using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The clang++ compiler was unavailable for C++ compilation\n    - Solution: The project required clang++ for compilation, but the compiler was not installed. The root cause was a missing C++ toolchain package. The solution was to install the Clang compiler suite.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y clang\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\n- xcodebuild\n- msbuild\n- gradle\n- bazel\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: C++ 11 and newer\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - g++-13\n  - clang++-18\n  - cmake\n  - make\n  - xcodebuild\n  - msbuild\n  - gradle\n  - bazel\n  - Java\n  - Python\n  - Rust\n  - Swift\n  - TypeScript\n  - Dart\n  - Nim\n  - PHP\n  - Go\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake failed to detect a C++ compiler after installation\n    - Solution: The C++ compiler (g++) was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for compiling C++ code in CMake-based projects. The root cause was a missing compiler package, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler. The solution was to install g++ using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed during project build due to missing g++ compiler\n    - Solution: The build process required the g++ compiler for compiling C++ source files, which was not installed in the Ubuntu environment. The root cause was an incomplete build dependency setup, as g++ was not included in the initial package installation. The solution was to install the g++ package using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The cmake command failed when configuring the project due to missing installation.\n    - Solution: CMake was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for building projects configured with CMake. The root cause was a missing build tool package in the environment configuration. The solution was to update the package index and install CMake using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The clang++ compiler was unavailable for C++ compilation\n    - Solution: The project required clang++ for compilation, but the compiler was not installed. The root cause was a missing C++ toolchain package. The solution was to install the Clang compiler suite.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y clang\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\n- xcodebuild\n- msbuild\n- gradle\n- bazel\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: C++ 11 and newer\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - g++-13\n  - clang++-18\n  - cmake\n  - make\n  - xcodebuild\n  - msbuild\n  - gradle\n  - bazel\n  - Java\n  - Python\n  - Rust\n  - Swift\n  - TypeScript\n  - Dart\n  - Nim\n  - PHP\n  - Go\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake failed to detect a C++ compiler after installation\n    - Solution: The C++ compiler (g++) was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for compiling C++ code in CMake-based projects. The root cause was a missing compiler package, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler. The solution was to install g++ using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed during project build due to missing g++ compiler\n    - Solution: The build process required the g++ compiler for compiling C++ source files, which was not installed in the Ubuntu environment. The root cause was an incomplete build dependency setup, as g++ was not included in the initial package installation. The solution was to install the g++ package using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The cmake command failed when configuring the project due to missing installation.\n    - Solution: CMake was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for building projects configured with CMake. The root cause was a missing build tool package in the environment configuration. The solution was to update the package index and install CMake using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The clang++ compiler was unavailable for C++ compilation\n    - Solution: The project required clang++ for compilation, but the compiler was not installed. The root cause was a missing C++ toolchain package. The solution was to install the Clang compiler suite.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y clang\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you.

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\n- xcodebuild\n- msbuild\n- gradle\n- bazel\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: C++ 11 and newer\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - g++-13\n  - clang++-18\n  - cmake\n  - make\n  - xcodebuild\n  - msbuild\n  - gradle\n  - bazel\n  - Java\n  - Python\n  - Rust\n  - Swift\n  - TypeScript\n  - Dart\n  - Nim\n  - PHP\n  - Go\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake failed to detect a C++ compiler after installation\n    - Solution: The C++ compiler (g++) was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for compiling C++ code in CMake-based projects. The root cause was a missing compiler package, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler. The solution was to install g++ using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed during project build due to missing g++ compiler\n    - Solution: The build process required the g++ compiler for compiling C++ source files, which was not installed in the Ubuntu environment. The root cause was an incomplete build dependency setup, as g++ was not included in the initial package installation. The solution was to install the g++ package using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The cmake command failed when configuring the project due to missing installation.\n    - Solution: CMake was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for building projects configured with CMake. The root cause was a missing build tool package in the environment configuration. The solution was to update the package index and install CMake using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The clang++ compiler was unavailable for C++ compilation\n    - Solution: The project required clang++ for compilation, but the compiler was not installed. The root cause was a missing C++ toolchain package. The solution was to install the Clang compiler suite.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y clang\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake failed to detect a C++ compiler after installation\n    - Solution: The C++ compiler (g++) was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for compiling C++ code in CMake-based projects. The root cause was a missing compiler package, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler. The solution was to install g++ using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed during project build due to missing g++ compiler\n    - Solution: The build process required the g++ compiler for compiling C++ source files, which was not installed in the Ubuntu environment. The root cause was an incomplete build dependency setup, as g++ was not included in the initial package installation. The solution was to install the g++ package using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The cmake command failed when configuring the project due to missing installation.\n    - Solution: CMake was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for building projects configured with CMake. The root cause was a missing build tool package in the environment configuration. The solution was to update the package index and install CMake using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The clang++ compiler was unavailable for C++ compilation\n    - Solution: The project required clang++ for compilation, but the compiler was not installed. The root cause was a missing C++ toolchain package. The solution was to install the Clang compiler suite.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y clang\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\",\"instance_template\":\"We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\\n\\n{{repo_related_info}}\\n\\n{{cross_repo_knowledge}}\\n\\nTASK TIPS:\\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.\",\"next_step_template\":\"{{observation}}\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"next_step_no_output_template\":\"Your command ran successfully and did not produce any output.\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"strategy_template\":null,\"demonstration_template\":null,\"success_reflection_template\":\"You are an expert code assistant who just successfully repaired a software project in an automated programming session.
