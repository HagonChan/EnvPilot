          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Go\n  version_constraint: '1.21'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The installed Go version was outdated and incompatible with module-based builds\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the default package repository provided an older Go version (1.11) which lacked full support for Go modules, resulting in 'cannot use modules with build cache disabled' errors. The solution was to manually download and install a compatible version (1.13.15) from the official source, followed by updating the PATH to prioritize the new installation.\n    - Action: wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Go version in the environment was incompatible with the project, causing test failures when running the test suite.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project required Go version 1.16 (as specified in go.mod), but the environment had either an outdated version (1.16.15 was initially present but lacked features for dependency installation) or an incompatible newer version (1.22.1 caused build errors). This mismatch led to compilation failures during testing. The solution was to install the exact Go version 1.16.15 by downloading it from the official Go repository and configuring the PATH to prioritize this version.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go && wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The Go test command failed due to missing dependencies required for building the project\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the initial environment setup did not include all necessary Go dependencies for the project. When running 'go test -race ./...', the system attempted to download missing packages but encountered failures. This occurred because the Ubuntu environment lacked the required dependencies for building the project from source. The solution was to install the missing dependencies using 'go get' before running tests, ensuring the environment had all necessary packages.\n    - Action: go get ./...\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to outdated Go version incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The installed Go version (1.11.13) was too old and lacked required packages like log/slog, causing module resolution failures. The root cause was an incompatible runtime environment. The solution was to install a compatible Go version (1.21.0) via direct download and update the PATH to include it.\n    - Action: wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed when building the project from the root directory\n    - Solution: The Go project structure required installation from subdirectories rather than the root. The root cause was that the repository contained no main package files in the root directory, making the standard go install command ineffective. The solution was to target all subdirectories using the ./... pattern to build and install all packages.\n    - Action: go install ./...\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed due to missing standard library packages in the Go environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was an outdated Go version (1.16.15) that lacked newer standard library packages like 'net/netip' and 'slices', which are required by project dependencies. This environment configuration issue prevented tool installation. The solution was to download all necessary dependencies using go mod download, which resolved the missing package errors and enabled successful test execution.\n    - Action: go mod download\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Conflicting Go installation files caused build errors during test execution\n    - Solution: Residual files from previous Go installations conflicted with the new version, leading to 'redeclared' and 'defined in both' errors. The root cause was incomplete removal of old installations. The solution was to delete all residual Go directories and reinstall the correct version to ensure a clean environment.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go /usr/lib/go /usr/local/bin/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.12.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The Go toolchain was not installed on the system\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Go installation required for building and testing the Go project. The solution involved updating the package index and installing Go using the system package manager (apt-get). This addressed the initial 'go: command not found' error by providing the necessary compiler and tools.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The go command was not found when attempting to download Go module dependencies\n    - Solution: The Go programming language was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and testing Go projects. The root cause was a missing essential package in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Go using the apt package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The initial Go test command failed due to a compilation error in the transport package caused by invalid string conversion\n    - Solution: The code used 'string(128)' which is incompatible with Go 1.24+ as it produces a string of one rune instead of a byte array. The root cause was outdated string handling in test code that conflicted with newer Go language specifications. The solution was to replace it with byte slice conversion to correctly handle binary data.\n    - Action: edit 'const binaryValue = string(128)' 'const binaryValue = string([]byte{0x80})'\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Go\n  version_constraint: '1.21'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The installed Go version was outdated and incompatible with module-based builds\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the default package repository provided an older Go version (1.11) which lacked full support for Go modules, resulting in 'cannot use modules with build cache disabled' errors. The solution was to manually download and install a compatible version (1.13.15) from the official source, followed by updating the PATH to prioritize the new installation.\n    - Action: wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Go version in the environment was incompatible with the project, causing test failures when running the test suite.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project required Go version 1.16 (as specified in go.mod), but the environment had either an outdated version (1.16.15 was initially present but lacked features for dependency installation) or an incompatible newer version (1.22.1 caused build errors). This mismatch led to compilation failures during testing. The solution was to install the exact Go version 1.16.15 by downloading it from the official Go repository and configuring the PATH to prioritize this version.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go && wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The Go test command failed due to missing dependencies required for building the project\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the initial environment setup did not include all necessary Go dependencies for the project. When running 'go test -race ./...', the system attempted to download missing packages but encountered failures. This occurred because the Ubuntu environment lacked the required dependencies for building the project from source. The solution was to install the missing dependencies using 'go get' before running tests, ensuring the environment had all necessary packages.\n    - Action: go get ./...\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to outdated Go version incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The installed Go version (1.11.13) was too old and lacked required packages like log/slog, causing module resolution failures. The root cause was an incompatible runtime environment. The solution was to install a compatible Go version (1.21.0) via direct download and update the PATH to include it.\n    - Action: wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed when building the project from the root directory\n    - Solution: The Go project structure required installation from subdirectories rather than the root. The root cause was that the repository contained no main package files in the root directory, making the standard go install command ineffective. The solution was to target all subdirectories using the ./... pattern to build and install all packages.\n    - Action: go install ./...\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed due to missing standard library packages in the Go environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was an outdated Go version (1.16.15) that lacked newer standard library packages like 'net/netip' and 'slices', which are required by project dependencies. This environment configuration issue prevented tool installation. The solution was to download all necessary dependencies using go mod download, which resolved the missing package errors and enabled successful test execution.\n    - Action: go mod download\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Conflicting Go installation files caused build errors during test execution\n    - Solution: Residual files from previous Go installations conflicted with the new version, leading to 'redeclared' and 'defined in both' errors. The root cause was incomplete removal of old installations. The solution was to delete all residual Go directories and reinstall the correct version to ensure a clean environment.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go /usr/lib/go /usr/local/bin/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.12.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The Go toolchain was not installed on the system\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Go installation required for building and testing the Go project. The solution involved updating the package index and installing Go using the system package manager (apt-get). This addressed the initial 'go: command not found' error by providing the necessary compiler and tools.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The go command was not found when attempting to download Go module dependencies\n    - Solution: The Go programming language was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and testing Go projects. The root cause was a missing essential package in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Go using the apt package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The initial Go test command failed due to a compilation error in the transport package caused by invalid string conversion\n    - Solution: The code used 'string(128)' which is incompatible with Go 1.24+ as it produces a string of one rune instead of a byte array. The root cause was outdated string handling in test code that conflicted with newer Go language specifications. The solution was to replace it with byte slice conversion to correctly handle binary data.\n    - Action: edit 'const binaryValue = string(128)' 'const binaryValue = string([]byte{0x80})'\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Go\n  version_constraint: '1.21'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The installed Go version was outdated and incompatible with module-based builds\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the default package repository provided an older Go version (1.11) which lacked full support for Go modules, resulting in 'cannot use modules with build cache disabled' errors. The solution was to manually download and install a compatible version (1.13.15) from the official source, followed by updating the PATH to prioritize the new installation.\n    - Action: wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Go version in the environment was incompatible with the project, causing test failures when running the test suite.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project required Go version 1.16 (as specified in go.mod), but the environment had either an outdated version (1.16.15 was initially present but lacked features for dependency installation) or an incompatible newer version (1.22.1 caused build errors). This mismatch led to compilation failures during testing. The solution was to install the exact Go version 1.16.15 by downloading it from the official Go repository and configuring the PATH to prioritize this version.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go && wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The Go test command failed due to missing dependencies required for building the project\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the initial environment setup did not include all necessary Go dependencies for the project. When running 'go test -race ./...', the system attempted to download missing packages but encountered failures. This occurred because the Ubuntu environment lacked the required dependencies for building the project from source. The solution was to install the missing dependencies using 'go get' before running tests, ensuring the environment had all necessary packages.\n    - Action: go get ./...\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to outdated Go version incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The installed Go version (1.11.13) was too old and lacked required packages like log/slog, causing module resolution failures. The root cause was an incompatible runtime environment. The solution was to install a compatible Go version (1.21.0) via direct download and update the PATH to include it.\n    - Action: wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed when building the project from the root directory\n    - Solution: The Go project structure required installation from subdirectories rather than the root. The root cause was that the repository contained no main package files in the root directory, making the standard go install command ineffective. The solution was to target all subdirectories using the ./... pattern to build and install all packages.\n    - Action: go install ./...\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed due to missing standard library packages in the Go environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was an outdated Go version (1.16.15) that lacked newer standard library packages like 'net/netip' and 'slices', which are required by project dependencies. This environment configuration issue prevented tool installation. The solution was to download all necessary dependencies using go mod download, which resolved the missing package errors and enabled successful test execution.\n    - Action: go mod download\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Conflicting Go installation files caused build errors during test execution\n    - Solution: Residual files from previous Go installations conflicted with the new version, leading to 'redeclared' and 'defined in both' errors. The root cause was incomplete removal of old installations. The solution was to delete all residual Go directories and reinstall the correct version to ensure a clean environment.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go /usr/lib/go /usr/local/bin/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.12.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The Go toolchain was not installed on the system\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Go installation required for building and testing the Go project. The solution involved updating the package index and installing Go using the system package manager (apt-get). This addressed the initial 'go: command not found' error by providing the necessary compiler and tools.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The go command was not found when attempting to download Go module dependencies\n    - Solution: The Go programming language was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and testing Go projects. The root cause was a missing essential package in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Go using the apt package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The initial Go test command failed due to a compilation error in the transport package caused by invalid string conversion\n    - Solution: The code used 'string(128)' which is incompatible with Go 1.24+ as it produces a string of one rune instead of a byte array. The root cause was outdated string handling in test code that conflicted with newer Go language specifications. The solution was to replace it with byte slice conversion to correctly handle binary data.\n    - Action: edit 'const binaryValue = string(128)' 'const binaryValue = string([]byte{0x80})'\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Go\n  version_constraint: '1.21'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The installed Go version was outdated and incompatible with module-based builds\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the default package repository provided an older Go version (1.11) which lacked full support for Go modules, resulting in 'cannot use modules with build cache disabled' errors. The solution was to manually download and install a compatible version (1.13.15) from the official source, followed by updating the PATH to prioritize the new installation.\n    - Action: wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Go version in the environment was incompatible with the project, causing test failures when running the test suite.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project required Go version 1.16 (as specified in go.mod), but the environment had either an outdated version (1.16.15 was initially present but lacked features for dependency installation) or an incompatible newer version (1.22.1 caused build errors). This mismatch led to compilation failures during testing. The solution was to install the exact Go version 1.16.15 by downloading it from the official Go repository and configuring the PATH to prioritize this version.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go && wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The Go test command failed due to missing dependencies required for building the project\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the initial environment setup did not include all necessary Go dependencies for the project. When running 'go test -race ./...', the system attempted to download missing packages but encountered failures. This occurred because the Ubuntu environment lacked the required dependencies for building the project from source. The solution was to install the missing dependencies using 'go get' before running tests, ensuring the environment had all necessary packages.\n    - Action: go get ./...\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to outdated Go version incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The installed Go version (1.11.13) was too old and lacked required packages like log/slog, causing module resolution failures. The root cause was an incompatible runtime environment. The solution was to install a compatible Go version (1.21.0) via direct download and update the PATH to include it.\n    - Action: wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed when building the project from the root directory\n    - Solution: The Go project structure required installation from subdirectories rather than the root. The root cause was that the repository contained no main package files in the root directory, making the standard go install command ineffective. The solution was to target all subdirectories using the ./... pattern to build and install all packages.\n    - Action: go install ./...\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed due to missing standard library packages in the Go environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was an outdated Go version (1.16.15) that lacked newer standard library packages like 'net/netip' and 'slices', which are required by project dependencies. This environment configuration issue prevented tool installation. The solution was to download all necessary dependencies using go mod download, which resolved the missing package errors and enabled successful test execution.\n    - Action: go mod download\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Conflicting Go installation files caused build errors during test execution\n    - Solution: Residual files from previous Go installations conflicted with the new version, leading to 'redeclared' and 'defined in both' errors. The root cause was incomplete removal of old installations. The solution was to delete all residual Go directories and reinstall the correct version to ensure a clean environment.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go /usr/lib/go /usr/local/bin/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.12.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The Go toolchain was not installed on the system\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Go installation required for building and testing the Go project. The solution involved updating the package index and installing Go using the system package manager (apt-get). This addressed the initial 'go: command not found' error by providing the necessary compiler and tools.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The go command was not found when attempting to download Go module dependencies\n    - Solution: The Go programming language was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and testing Go projects. The root cause was a missing essential package in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Go using the apt package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The initial Go test command failed due to a compilation error in the transport package caused by invalid string conversion\n    - Solution: The code used 'string(128)' which is incompatible with Go 1.24+ as it produces a string of one rune instead of a byte array. The root cause was outdated string handling in test code that conflicted with newer Go language specifications. The solution was to replace it with byte slice conversion to correctly handle binary data.\n    - Action: edit 'const binaryValue = string(128)' 'const binaryValue = string([]byte{0x80})'\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Go\n  version_constraint: '1.21'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The installed Go version was outdated and incompatible with module-based builds\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the default package repository provided an older Go version (1.11) which lacked full support for Go modules, resulting in 'cannot use modules with build cache disabled' errors. The solution was to manually download and install a compatible version (1.13.15) from the official source, followed by updating the PATH to prioritize the new installation.\n    - Action: wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Go version in the environment was incompatible with the project, causing test failures when running the test suite.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project required Go version 1.16 (as specified in go.mod), but the environment had either an outdated version (1.16.15 was initially present but lacked features for dependency installation) or an incompatible newer version (1.22.1 caused build errors). This mismatch led to compilation failures during testing. The solution was to install the exact Go version 1.16.15 by downloading it from the official Go repository and configuring the PATH to prioritize this version.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go && wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The Go test command failed due to missing dependencies required for building the project\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the initial environment setup did not include all necessary Go dependencies for the project. When running 'go test -race ./...', the system attempted to download missing packages but encountered failures. This occurred because the Ubuntu environment lacked the required dependencies for building the project from source. The solution was to install the missing dependencies using 'go get' before running tests, ensuring the environment had all necessary packages.\n    - Action: go get ./...\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to outdated Go version incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The installed Go version (1.11.13) was too old and lacked required packages like log/slog, causing module resolution failures. The root cause was an incompatible runtime environment. The solution was to install a compatible Go version (1.21.0) via direct download and update the PATH to include it.\n    - Action: wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed when building the project from the root directory\n    - Solution: The Go project structure required installation from subdirectories rather than the root. The root cause was that the repository contained no main package files in the root directory, making the standard go install command ineffective. The solution was to target all subdirectories using the ./... pattern to build and install all packages.\n    - Action: go install ./...\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed due to missing standard library packages in the Go environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was an outdated Go version (1.16.15) that lacked newer standard library packages like 'net/netip' and 'slices', which are required by project dependencies. This environment configuration issue prevented tool installation. The solution was to download all necessary dependencies using go mod download, which resolved the missing package errors and enabled successful test execution.\n    - Action: go mod download\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Conflicting Go installation files caused build errors during test execution\n    - Solution: Residual files from previous Go installations conflicted with the new version, leading to 'redeclared' and 'defined in both' errors. The root cause was incomplete removal of old installations. The solution was to delete all residual Go directories and reinstall the correct version to ensure a clean environment.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go /usr/lib/go /usr/local/bin/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.12.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The Go toolchain was not installed on the system\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Go installation required for building and testing the Go project. The solution involved updating the package index and installing Go using the system package manager (apt-get). This addressed the initial 'go: command not found' error by providing the necessary compiler and tools.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The go command was not found when attempting to download Go module dependencies\n    - Solution: The Go programming language was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and testing Go projects. The root cause was a missing essential package in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Go using the apt package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The initial Go test command failed due to a compilation error in the transport package caused by invalid string conversion\n    - Solution: The code used 'string(128)' which is incompatible with Go 1.24+ as it produces a string of one rune instead of a byte array. The root cause was outdated string handling in test code that conflicted with newer Go language specifications. The solution was to replace it with byte slice conversion to correctly handle binary data.\n    - Action: edit 'const binaryValue = string(128)' 'const binaryValue = string([]byte{0x80})'\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Go\n  version_constraint: '1.21'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The installed Go version was outdated and incompatible with module-based builds\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the default package repository provided an older Go version (1.11) which lacked full support for Go modules, resulting in 'cannot use modules with build cache disabled' errors. The solution was to manually download and install a compatible version (1.13.15) from the official source, followed by updating the PATH to prioritize the new installation.\n    - Action: wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Go version in the environment was incompatible with the project, causing test failures when running the test suite.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project required Go version 1.16 (as specified in go.mod), but the environment had either an outdated version (1.16.15 was initially present but lacked features for dependency installation) or an incompatible newer version (1.22.1 caused build errors). This mismatch led to compilation failures during testing. The solution was to install the exact Go version 1.16.15 by downloading it from the official Go repository and configuring the PATH to prioritize this version.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go && wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The Go test command failed due to missing dependencies required for building the project\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the initial environment setup did not include all necessary Go dependencies for the project. When running 'go test -race ./...', the system attempted to download missing packages but encountered failures. This occurred because the Ubuntu environment lacked the required dependencies for building the project from source. The solution was to install the missing dependencies using 'go get' before running tests, ensuring the environment had all necessary packages.\n    - Action: go get ./...\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to outdated Go version incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The installed Go version (1.11.13) was too old and lacked required packages like log/slog, causing module resolution failures. The root cause was an incompatible runtime environment. The solution was to install a compatible Go version (1.21.0) via direct download and update the PATH to include it.\n    - Action: wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed when building the project from the root directory\n    - Solution: The Go project structure required installation from subdirectories rather than the root. The root cause was that the repository contained no main package files in the root directory, making the standard go install command ineffective. The solution was to target all subdirectories using the ./... pattern to build and install all packages.\n    - Action: go install ./...\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed due to missing standard library packages in the Go environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was an outdated Go version (1.16.15) that lacked newer standard library packages like 'net/netip' and 'slices', which are required by project dependencies. This environment configuration issue prevented tool installation. The solution was to download all necessary dependencies using go mod download, which resolved the missing package errors and enabled successful test execution.\n    - Action: go mod download\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Conflicting Go installation files caused build errors during test execution\n    - Solution: Residual files from previous Go installations conflicted with the new version, leading to 'redeclared' and 'defined in both' errors. The root cause was incomplete removal of old installations. The solution was to delete all residual Go directories and reinstall the correct version to ensure a clean environment.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go /usr/lib/go /usr/local/bin/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.12.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The Go toolchain was not installed on the system\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Go installation required for building and testing the Go project. The solution involved updating the package index and installing Go using the system package manager (apt-get). This addressed the initial 'go: command not found' error by providing the necessary compiler and tools.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The go command was not found when attempting to download Go module dependencies\n    - Solution: The Go programming language was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and testing Go projects. The root cause was a missing essential package in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Go using the apt package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The initial Go test command failed due to a compilation error in the transport package caused by invalid string conversion\n    - Solution: The code used 'string(128)' which is incompatible with Go 1.24+ as it produces a string of one rune instead of a byte array. The root cause was outdated string handling in test code that conflicted with newer Go language specifications. The solution was to replace it with byte slice conversion to correctly handle binary data.\n    - Action: edit 'const binaryValue = string(128)' 'const binaryValue = string([]byte{0x80})'\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Go\n  version_constraint: '1.21'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The installed Go version was outdated and incompatible with module-based builds\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the default package repository provided an older Go version (1.11) which lacked full support for Go modules, resulting in 'cannot use modules with build cache disabled' errors. The solution was to manually download and install a compatible version (1.13.15) from the official source, followed by updating the PATH to prioritize the new installation.\n    - Action: wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Go version in the environment was incompatible with the project, causing test failures when running the test suite.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project required Go version 1.16 (as specified in go.mod), but the environment had either an outdated version (1.16.15 was initially present but lacked features for dependency installation) or an incompatible newer version (1.22.1 caused build errors). This mismatch led to compilation failures during testing. The solution was to install the exact Go version 1.16.15 by downloading it from the official Go repository and configuring the PATH to prioritize this version.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go && wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The Go test command failed due to missing dependencies required for building the project\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the initial environment setup did not include all necessary Go dependencies for the project. When running 'go test -race ./...', the system attempted to download missing packages but encountered failures. This occurred because the Ubuntu environment lacked the required dependencies for building the project from source. The solution was to install the missing dependencies using 'go get' before running tests, ensuring the environment had all necessary packages.\n    - Action: go get ./...\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to outdated Go version incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The installed Go version (1.11.13) was too old and lacked required packages like log/slog, causing module resolution failures. The root cause was an incompatible runtime environment. The solution was to install a compatible Go version (1.21.0) via direct download and update the PATH to include it.\n    - Action: wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed when building the project from the root directory\n    - Solution: The Go project structure required installation from subdirectories rather than the root. The root cause was that the repository contained no main package files in the root directory, making the standard go install command ineffective. The solution was to target all subdirectories using the ./... pattern to build and install all packages.\n    - Action: go install ./...\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed due to missing standard library packages in the Go environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was an outdated Go version (1.16.15) that lacked newer standard library packages like 'net/netip' and 'slices', which are required by project dependencies. This environment configuration issue prevented tool installation. The solution was to download all necessary dependencies using go mod download, which resolved the missing package errors and enabled successful test execution.\n    - Action: go mod download\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Conflicting Go installation files caused build errors during test execution\n    - Solution: Residual files from previous Go installations conflicted with the new version, leading to 'redeclared' and 'defined in both' errors. The root cause was incomplete removal of old installations. The solution was to delete all residual Go directories and reinstall the correct version to ensure a clean environment.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go /usr/lib/go /usr/local/bin/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.12.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The Go toolchain was not installed on the system\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Go installation required for building and testing the Go project. The solution involved updating the package index and installing Go using the system package manager (apt-get). This addressed the initial 'go: command not found' error by providing the necessary compiler and tools.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The go command was not found when attempting to download Go module dependencies\n    - Solution: The Go programming language was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and testing Go projects. The root cause was a missing essential package in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Go using the apt package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The initial Go test command failed due to a compilation error in the transport package caused by invalid string conversion\n    - Solution: The code used 'string(128)' which is incompatible with Go 1.24+ as it produces a string of one rune instead of a byte array. The root cause was outdated string handling in test code that conflicted with newer Go language specifications. The solution was to replace it with byte slice conversion to correctly handle binary data.\n    - Action: edit 'const binaryValue = string(128)' 'const binaryValue = string([]byte{0x80})'\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Go\n  version_constraint: '1.21'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The installed Go version was outdated and incompatible with module-based builds\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the default package repository provided an older Go version (1.11) which lacked full support for Go modules, resulting in 'cannot use modules with build cache disabled' errors. The solution was to manually download and install a compatible version (1.13.15) from the official source, followed by updating the PATH to prioritize the new installation.\n    - Action: wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Go version in the environment was incompatible with the project, causing test failures when running the test suite.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project required Go version 1.16 (as specified in go.mod), but the environment had either an outdated version (1.16.15 was initially present but lacked features for dependency installation) or an incompatible newer version (1.22.1 caused build errors). This mismatch led to compilation failures during testing. The solution was to install the exact Go version 1.16.15 by downloading it from the official Go repository and configuring the PATH to prioritize this version.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go && wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The Go test command failed due to missing dependencies required for building the project\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the initial environment setup did not include all necessary Go dependencies for the project. When running 'go test -race ./...', the system attempted to download missing packages but encountered failures. This occurred because the Ubuntu environment lacked the required dependencies for building the project from source. The solution was to install the missing dependencies using 'go get' before running tests, ensuring the environment had all necessary packages.\n    - Action: go get ./...\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to outdated Go version incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The installed Go version (1.11.13) was too old and lacked required packages like log/slog, causing module resolution failures. The root cause was an incompatible runtime environment. The solution was to install a compatible Go version (1.21.0) via direct download and update the PATH to include it.\n    - Action: wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed when building the project from the root directory\n    - Solution: The Go project structure required installation from subdirectories rather than the root. The root cause was that the repository contained no main package files in the root directory, making the standard go install command ineffective. The solution was to target all subdirectories using the ./... pattern to build and install all packages.\n    - Action: go install ./...\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed due to missing standard library packages in the Go environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was an outdated Go version (1.16.15) that lacked newer standard library packages like 'net/netip' and 'slices', which are required by project dependencies. This environment configuration issue prevented tool installation. The solution was to download all necessary dependencies using go mod download, which resolved the missing package errors and enabled successful test execution.\n    - Action: go mod download\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Conflicting Go installation files caused build errors during test execution\n    - Solution: Residual files from previous Go installations conflicted with the new version, leading to 'redeclared' and 'defined in both' errors. The root cause was incomplete removal of old installations. The solution was to delete all residual Go directories and reinstall the correct version to ensure a clean environment.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go /usr/lib/go /usr/local/bin/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.12.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The Go toolchain was not installed on the system\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Go installation required for building and testing the Go project. The solution involved updating the package index and installing Go using the system package manager (apt-get). This addressed the initial 'go: command not found' error by providing the necessary compiler and tools.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The go command was not found when attempting to download Go module dependencies\n    - Solution: The Go programming language was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and testing Go projects. The root cause was a missing essential package in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Go using the apt package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The initial Go test command failed due to a compilation error in the transport package caused by invalid string conversion\n    - Solution: The code used 'string(128)' which is incompatible with Go 1.24+ as it produces a string of one rune instead of a byte array. The root cause was outdated string handling in test code that conflicted with newer Go language specifications. The solution was to replace it with byte slice conversion to correctly handle binary data.\n    - Action: edit 'const binaryValue = string(128)' 'const binaryValue = string([]byte{0x80})'\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Go\n  version_constraint: '1.21'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The installed Go version was outdated and incompatible with module-based builds\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the default package repository provided an older Go version (1.11) which lacked full support for Go modules, resulting in 'cannot use modules with build cache disabled' errors. The solution was to manually download and install a compatible version (1.13.15) from the official source, followed by updating the PATH to prioritize the new installation.\n    - Action: wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Go version in the environment was incompatible with the project, causing test failures when running the test suite.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project required Go version 1.16 (as specified in go.mod), but the environment had either an outdated version (1.16.15 was initially present but lacked features for dependency installation) or an incompatible newer version (1.22.1 caused build errors). This mismatch led to compilation failures during testing. The solution was to install the exact Go version 1.16.15 by downloading it from the official Go repository and configuring the PATH to prioritize this version.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go && wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The Go test command failed due to missing dependencies required for building the project\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the initial environment setup did not include all necessary Go dependencies for the project. When running 'go test -race ./...', the system attempted to download missing packages but encountered failures. This occurred because the Ubuntu environment lacked the required dependencies for building the project from source. The solution was to install the missing dependencies using 'go get' before running tests, ensuring the environment had all necessary packages.\n    - Action: go get ./...\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to outdated Go version incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The installed Go version (1.11.13) was too old and lacked required packages like log/slog, causing module resolution failures. The root cause was an incompatible runtime environment. The solution was to install a compatible Go version (1.21.0) via direct download and update the PATH to include it.\n    - Action: wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed when building the project from the root directory\n    - Solution: The Go project structure required installation from subdirectories rather than the root. The root cause was that the repository contained no main package files in the root directory, making the standard go install command ineffective. The solution was to target all subdirectories using the ./... pattern to build and install all packages.\n    - Action: go install ./...\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed due to missing standard library packages in the Go environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was an outdated Go version (1.16.15) that lacked newer standard library packages like 'net/netip' and 'slices', which are required by project dependencies. This environment configuration issue prevented tool installation. The solution was to download all necessary dependencies using go mod download, which resolved the missing package errors and enabled successful test execution.\n    - Action: go mod download\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Conflicting Go installation files caused build errors during test execution\n    - Solution: Residual files from previous Go installations conflicted with the new version, leading to 'redeclared' and 'defined in both' errors. The root cause was incomplete removal of old installations. The solution was to delete all residual Go directories and reinstall the correct version to ensure a clean environment.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go /usr/lib/go /usr/local/bin/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.12.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The Go toolchain was not installed on the system\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Go installation required for building and testing the Go project. The solution involved updating the package index and installing Go using the system package manager (apt-get). This addressed the initial 'go: command not found' error by providing the necessary compiler and tools.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The go command was not found when attempting to download Go module dependencies\n    - Solution: The Go programming language was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and testing Go projects. The root cause was a missing essential package in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Go using the apt package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The initial Go test command failed due to a compilation error in the transport package caused by invalid string conversion\n    - Solution: The code used 'string(128)' which is incompatible with Go 1.24+ as it produces a string of one rune instead of a byte array. The root cause was outdated string handling in test code that conflicted with newer Go language specifications. The solution was to replace it with byte slice conversion to correctly handle binary data.\n    - Action: edit 'const binaryValue = string(128)' 'const binaryValue = string([]byte{0x80})'\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Go\n  version_constraint: '1.21'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The installed Go version was outdated and incompatible with module-based builds\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the default package repository provided an older Go version (1.11) which lacked full support for Go modules, resulting in 'cannot use modules with build cache disabled' errors. The solution was to manually download and install a compatible version (1.13.15) from the official source, followed by updating the PATH to prioritize the new installation.\n    - Action: wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Go version in the environment was incompatible with the project, causing test failures when running the test suite.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project required Go version 1.16 (as specified in go.mod), but the environment had either an outdated version (1.16.15 was initially present but lacked features for dependency installation) or an incompatible newer version (1.22.1 caused build errors). This mismatch led to compilation failures during testing. The solution was to install the exact Go version 1.16.15 by downloading it from the official Go repository and configuring the PATH to prioritize this version.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go && wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The Go test command failed due to missing dependencies required for building the project\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the initial environment setup did not include all necessary Go dependencies for the project. When running 'go test -race ./...', the system attempted to download missing packages but encountered failures. This occurred because the Ubuntu environment lacked the required dependencies for building the project from source. The solution was to install the missing dependencies using 'go get' before running tests, ensuring the environment had all necessary packages.\n    - Action: go get ./...\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to outdated Go version incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The installed Go version (1.11.13) was too old and lacked required packages like log/slog, causing module resolution failures. The root cause was an incompatible runtime environment. The solution was to install a compatible Go version (1.21.0) via direct download and update the PATH to include it.\n    - Action: wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed when building the project from the root directory\n    - Solution: The Go project structure required installation from subdirectories rather than the root. The root cause was that the repository contained no main package files in the root directory, making the standard go install command ineffective. The solution was to target all subdirectories using the ./... pattern to build and install all packages.\n    - Action: go install ./...\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed due to missing standard library packages in the Go environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was an outdated Go version (1.16.15) that lacked newer standard library packages like 'net/netip' and 'slices', which are required by project dependencies. This environment configuration issue prevented tool installation. The solution was to download all necessary dependencies using go mod download, which resolved the missing package errors and enabled successful test execution.\n    - Action: go mod download\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Conflicting Go installation files caused build errors during test execution\n    - Solution: Residual files from previous Go installations conflicted with the new version, leading to 'redeclared' and 'defined in both' errors. The root cause was incomplete removal of old installations. The solution was to delete all residual Go directories and reinstall the correct version to ensure a clean environment.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go /usr/lib/go /usr/local/bin/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.12.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The Go toolchain was not installed on the system\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Go installation required for building and testing the Go project. The solution involved updating the package index and installing Go using the system package manager (apt-get). This addressed the initial 'go: command not found' error by providing the necessary compiler and tools.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The go command was not found when attempting to download Go module dependencies\n    - Solution: The Go programming language was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and testing Go projects. The root cause was a missing essential package in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Go using the apt package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The initial Go test command failed due to a compilation error in the transport package caused by invalid string conversion\n    - Solution: The code used 'string(128)' which is incompatible with Go 1.24+ as it produces a string of one rune instead of a byte array. The root cause was outdated string handling in test code that conflicted with newer Go language specifications. The solution was to replace it with byte slice conversion to correctly handle binary data.\n    - Action: edit 'const binaryValue = string(128)' 'const binaryValue = string([]byte{0x80})'\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Go\n  version_constraint: '1.21'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The installed Go version was outdated and incompatible with module-based builds\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the default package repository provided an older Go version (1.11) which lacked full support for Go modules, resulting in 'cannot use modules with build cache disabled' errors. The solution was to manually download and install a compatible version (1.13.15) from the official source, followed by updating the PATH to prioritize the new installation.\n    - Action: wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Go version in the environment was incompatible with the project, causing test failures when running the test suite.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project required Go version 1.16 (as specified in go.mod), but the environment had either an outdated version (1.16.15 was initially present but lacked features for dependency installation) or an incompatible newer version (1.22.1 caused build errors). This mismatch led to compilation failures during testing. The solution was to install the exact Go version 1.16.15 by downloading it from the official Go repository and configuring the PATH to prioritize this version.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go && wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The Go test command failed due to missing dependencies required for building the project\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the initial environment setup did not include all necessary Go dependencies for the project. When running 'go test -race ./...', the system attempted to download missing packages but encountered failures. This occurred because the Ubuntu environment lacked the required dependencies for building the project from source. The solution was to install the missing dependencies using 'go get' before running tests, ensuring the environment had all necessary packages.\n    - Action: go get ./...\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to outdated Go version incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The installed Go version (1.11.13) was too old and lacked required packages like log/slog, causing module resolution failures. The root cause was an incompatible runtime environment. The solution was to install a compatible Go version (1.21.0) via direct download and update the PATH to include it.\n    - Action: wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed when building the project from the root directory\n    - Solution: The Go project structure required installation from subdirectories rather than the root. The root cause was that the repository contained no main package files in the root directory, making the standard go install command ineffective. The solution was to target all subdirectories using the ./... pattern to build and install all packages.\n    - Action: go install ./...\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed due to missing standard library packages in the Go environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was an outdated Go version (1.16.15) that lacked newer standard library packages like 'net/netip' and 'slices', which are required by project dependencies. This environment configuration issue prevented tool installation. The solution was to download all necessary dependencies using go mod download, which resolved the missing package errors and enabled successful test execution.\n    - Action: go mod download\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Conflicting Go installation files caused build errors during test execution\n    - Solution: Residual files from previous Go installations conflicted with the new version, leading to 'redeclared' and 'defined in both' errors. The root cause was incomplete removal of old installations. The solution was to delete all residual Go directories and reinstall the correct version to ensure a clean environment.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go /usr/lib/go /usr/local/bin/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.12.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The Go toolchain was not installed on the system\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Go installation required for building and testing the Go project. The solution involved updating the package index and installing Go using the system package manager (apt-get). This addressed the initial 'go: command not found' error by providing the necessary compiler and tools.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The go command was not found when attempting to download Go module dependencies\n    - Solution: The Go programming language was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and testing Go projects. The root cause was a missing essential package in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Go using the apt package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The initial Go test command failed due to a compilation error in the transport package caused by invalid string conversion\n    - Solution: The code used 'string(128)' which is incompatible with Go 1.24+ as it produces a string of one rune instead of a byte array. The root cause was outdated string handling in test code that conflicted with newer Go language specifications. The solution was to replace it with byte slice conversion to correctly handle binary data.\n    - Action: edit 'const binaryValue = string(128)' 'const binaryValue = string([]byte{0x80})'\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Go\n  version_constraint: '1.21'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The installed Go version was outdated and incompatible with module-based builds\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the default package repository provided an older Go version (1.11) which lacked full support for Go modules, resulting in 'cannot use modules with build cache disabled' errors. The solution was to manually download and install a compatible version (1.13.15) from the official source, followed by updating the PATH to prioritize the new installation.\n    - Action: wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Go version in the environment was incompatible with the project, causing test failures when running the test suite.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project required Go version 1.16 (as specified in go.mod), but the environment had either an outdated version (1.16.15 was initially present but lacked features for dependency installation) or an incompatible newer version (1.22.1 caused build errors). This mismatch led to compilation failures during testing. The solution was to install the exact Go version 1.16.15 by downloading it from the official Go repository and configuring the PATH to prioritize this version.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go && wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The Go test command failed due to missing dependencies required for building the project\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the initial environment setup did not include all necessary Go dependencies for the project. When running 'go test -race ./...', the system attempted to download missing packages but encountered failures. This occurred because the Ubuntu environment lacked the required dependencies for building the project from source. The solution was to install the missing dependencies using 'go get' before running tests, ensuring the environment had all necessary packages.\n    - Action: go get ./...\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to outdated Go version incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The installed Go version (1.11.13) was too old and lacked required packages like log/slog, causing module resolution failures. The root cause was an incompatible runtime environment. The solution was to install a compatible Go version (1.21.0) via direct download and update the PATH to include it.\n    - Action: wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed when building the project from the root directory\n    - Solution: The Go project structure required installation from subdirectories rather than the root. The root cause was that the repository contained no main package files in the root directory, making the standard go install command ineffective. The solution was to target all subdirectories using the ./... pattern to build and install all packages.\n    - Action: go install ./...\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed due to missing standard library packages in the Go environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was an outdated Go version (1.16.15) that lacked newer standard library packages like 'net/netip' and 'slices', which are required by project dependencies. This environment configuration issue prevented tool installation. The solution was to download all necessary dependencies using go mod download, which resolved the missing package errors and enabled successful test execution.\n    - Action: go mod download\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Conflicting Go installation files caused build errors during test execution\n    - Solution: Residual files from previous Go installations conflicted with the new version, leading to 'redeclared' and 'defined in both' errors. The root cause was incomplete removal of old installations. The solution was to delete all residual Go directories and reinstall the correct version to ensure a clean environment.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go /usr/lib/go /usr/local/bin/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.12.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The Go toolchain was not installed on the system\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Go installation required for building and testing the Go project. The solution involved updating the package index and installing Go using the system package manager (apt-get). This addressed the initial 'go: command not found' error by providing the necessary compiler and tools.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The go command was not found when attempting to download Go module dependencies\n    - Solution: The Go programming language was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and testing Go projects. The root cause was a missing essential package in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Go using the apt package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The initial Go test command failed due to a compilation error in the transport package caused by invalid string conversion\n    - Solution: The code used 'string(128)' which is incompatible with Go 1.24+ as it produces a string of one rune instead of a byte array. The root cause was outdated string handling in test code that conflicted with newer Go language specifications. The solution was to replace it with byte slice conversion to correctly handle binary data.\n    - Action: edit 'const binaryValue = string(128)' 'const binaryValue = string([]byte{0x80})'\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Go\n  version_constraint: '1.21'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The installed Go version was outdated and incompatible with module-based builds\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the default package repository provided an older Go version (1.11) which lacked full support for Go modules, resulting in 'cannot use modules with build cache disabled' errors. The solution was to manually download and install a compatible version (1.13.15) from the official source, followed by updating the PATH to prioritize the new installation.\n    - Action: wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Go version in the environment was incompatible with the project, causing test failures when running the test suite.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project required Go version 1.16 (as specified in go.mod), but the environment had either an outdated version (1.16.15 was initially present but lacked features for dependency installation) or an incompatible newer version (1.22.1 caused build errors). This mismatch led to compilation failures during testing. The solution was to install the exact Go version 1.16.15 by downloading it from the official Go repository and configuring the PATH to prioritize this version.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go && wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The Go test command failed due to missing dependencies required for building the project\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the initial environment setup did not include all necessary Go dependencies for the project. When running 'go test -race ./...', the system attempted to download missing packages but encountered failures. This occurred because the Ubuntu environment lacked the required dependencies for building the project from source. The solution was to install the missing dependencies using 'go get' before running tests, ensuring the environment had all necessary packages.\n    - Action: go get ./...\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to outdated Go version incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The installed Go version (1.11.13) was too old and lacked required packages like log/slog, causing module resolution failures. The root cause was an incompatible runtime environment. The solution was to install a compatible Go version (1.21.0) via direct download and update the PATH to include it.\n    - Action: wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed when building the project from the root directory\n    - Solution: The Go project structure required installation from subdirectories rather than the root. The root cause was that the repository contained no main package files in the root directory, making the standard go install command ineffective. The solution was to target all subdirectories using the ./... pattern to build and install all packages.\n    - Action: go install ./...\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed due to missing standard library packages in the Go environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was an outdated Go version (1.16.15) that lacked newer standard library packages like 'net/netip' and 'slices', which are required by project dependencies. This environment configuration issue prevented tool installation. The solution was to download all necessary dependencies using go mod download, which resolved the missing package errors and enabled successful test execution.\n    - Action: go mod download\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Conflicting Go installation files caused build errors during test execution\n    - Solution: Residual files from previous Go installations conflicted with the new version, leading to 'redeclared' and 'defined in both' errors. The root cause was incomplete removal of old installations. The solution was to delete all residual Go directories and reinstall the correct version to ensure a clean environment.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go /usr/lib/go /usr/local/bin/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.12.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The Go toolchain was not installed on the system\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Go installation required for building and testing the Go project. The solution involved updating the package index and installing Go using the system package manager (apt-get). This addressed the initial 'go: command not found' error by providing the necessary compiler and tools.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The go command was not found when attempting to download Go module dependencies\n    - Solution: The Go programming language was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and testing Go projects. The root cause was a missing essential package in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Go using the apt package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The initial Go test command failed due to a compilation error in the transport package caused by invalid string conversion\n    - Solution: The code used 'string(128)' which is incompatible with Go 1.24+ as it produces a string of one rune instead of a byte array. The root cause was outdated string handling in test code that conflicted with newer Go language specifications. The solution was to replace it with byte slice conversion to correctly handle binary data.\n    - Action: edit 'const binaryValue = string(128)' 'const binaryValue = string([]byte{0x80})'\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Go\n  version_constraint: '1.21'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The installed Go version was outdated and incompatible with module-based builds\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the default package repository provided an older Go version (1.11) which lacked full support for Go modules, resulting in 'cannot use modules with build cache disabled' errors. The solution was to manually download and install a compatible version (1.13.15) from the official source, followed by updating the PATH to prioritize the new installation.\n    - Action: wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Go version in the environment was incompatible with the project, causing test failures when running the test suite.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project required Go version 1.16 (as specified in go.mod), but the environment had either an outdated version (1.16.15 was initially present but lacked features for dependency installation) or an incompatible newer version (1.22.1 caused build errors). This mismatch led to compilation failures during testing. The solution was to install the exact Go version 1.16.15 by downloading it from the official Go repository and configuring the PATH to prioritize this version.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go && wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The Go test command failed due to missing dependencies required for building the project\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the initial environment setup did not include all necessary Go dependencies for the project. When running 'go test -race ./...', the system attempted to download missing packages but encountered failures. This occurred because the Ubuntu environment lacked the required dependencies for building the project from source. The solution was to install the missing dependencies using 'go get' before running tests, ensuring the environment had all necessary packages.\n    - Action: go get ./...\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to outdated Go version incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The installed Go version (1.11.13) was too old and lacked required packages like log/slog, causing module resolution failures. The root cause was an incompatible runtime environment. The solution was to install a compatible Go version (1.21.0) via direct download and update the PATH to include it.\n    - Action: wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed when building the project from the root directory\n    - Solution: The Go project structure required installation from subdirectories rather than the root. The root cause was that the repository contained no main package files in the root directory, making the standard go install command ineffective. The solution was to target all subdirectories using the ./... pattern to build and install all packages.\n    - Action: go install ./...\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed due to missing standard library packages in the Go environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was an outdated Go version (1.16.15) that lacked newer standard library packages like 'net/netip' and 'slices', which are required by project dependencies. This environment configuration issue prevented tool installation. The solution was to download all necessary dependencies using go mod download, which resolved the missing package errors and enabled successful test execution.\n    - Action: go mod download\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Conflicting Go installation files caused build errors during test execution\n    - Solution: Residual files from previous Go installations conflicted with the new version, leading to 'redeclared' and 'defined in both' errors. The root cause was incomplete removal of old installations. The solution was to delete all residual Go directories and reinstall the correct version to ensure a clean environment.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go /usr/lib/go /usr/local/bin/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.12.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The Go toolchain was not installed on the system\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Go installation required for building and testing the Go project. The solution involved updating the package index and installing Go using the system package manager (apt-get). This addressed the initial 'go: command not found' error by providing the necessary compiler and tools.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The go command was not found when attempting to download Go module dependencies\n    - Solution: The Go programming language was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and testing Go projects. The root cause was a missing essential package in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Go using the apt package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The initial Go test command failed due to a compilation error in the transport package caused by invalid string conversion\n    - Solution: The code used 'string(128)' which is incompatible with Go 1.24+ as it produces a string of one rune instead of a byte array. The root cause was outdated string handling in test code that conflicted with newer Go language specifications. The solution was to replace it with byte slice conversion to correctly handle binary data.\n    - Action: edit 'const binaryValue = string(128)' 'const binaryValue = string([]byte{0x80})'\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

      "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Go\n  version_constraint: '1.21'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The installed Go version was outdated and incompatible with module-based builds\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the default package repository provided an older Go version (1.11) which lacked full support for Go modules, resulting in 'cannot use modules with build cache disabled' errors. The solution was to manually download and install a compatible version (1.13.15) from the official source, followed by updating the PATH to prioritize the new installation.\n    - Action: wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.13.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Go version in the environment was incompatible with the project, causing test failures when running the test suite.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project required Go version 1.16 (as specified in go.mod), but the environment had either an outdated version (1.16.15 was initially present but lacked features for dependency installation) or an incompatible newer version (1.22.1 caused build errors). This mismatch led to compilation failures during testing. The solution was to install the exact Go version 1.16.15 by downloading it from the official Go repository and configuring the PATH to prioritize this version.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go && wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.16.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The Go test command failed due to missing dependencies required for building the project\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the initial environment setup did not include all necessary Go dependencies for the project. When running 'go test -race ./...', the system attempted to download missing packages but encountered failures. This occurred because the Ubuntu environment lacked the required dependencies for building the project from source. The solution was to install the missing dependencies using 'go get' before running tests, ensuring the environment had all necessary packages.\n    - Action: go get ./...\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to outdated Go version incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The installed Go version (1.11.13) was too old and lacked required packages like log/slog, causing module resolution failures. The root cause was an incompatible runtime environment. The solution was to install a compatible Go version (1.21.0) via direct download and update the PATH to include it.\n    - Action: wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed when building the project from the root directory\n    - Solution: The Go project structure required installation from subdirectories rather than the root. The root cause was that the repository contained no main package files in the root directory, making the standard go install command ineffective. The solution was to target all subdirectories using the ./... pattern to build and install all packages.\n    - Action: go install ./...\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The go install command failed due to missing standard library packages in the Go environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was an outdated Go version (1.16.15) that lacked newer standard library packages like 'net/netip' and 'slices', which are required by project dependencies. This environment configuration issue prevented tool installation. The solution was to download all necessary dependencies using go mod download, which resolved the missing package errors and enabled successful test execution.\n    - Action: go mod download\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Conflicting Go installation files caused build errors during test execution\n    - Solution: Residual files from previous Go installations conflicted with the new version, leading to 'redeclared' and 'defined in both' errors. The root cause was incomplete removal of old installations. The solution was to delete all residual Go directories and reinstall the correct version to ensure a clean environment.\n    - Action: rm -rf /usr/local/go /usr/lib/go /usr/local/bin/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.12.linux-amd64.tar.gz && export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The Go toolchain was not installed on the system\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Go installation required for building and testing the Go project. The solution involved updating the package index and installing Go using the system package manager (apt-get). This addressed the initial 'go: command not found' error by providing the necessary compiler and tools.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The go command was not found when attempting to download Go module dependencies\n    - Solution: The Go programming language was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and testing Go projects. The root cause was a missing essential package in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Go using the apt package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y golang\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The initial Go test command failed due to a compilation error in the transport package caused by invalid string conversion\n    - Solution: The code used 'string(128)' which is incompatible with Go 1.24+ as it produces a string of one rune instead of a byte array. The root cause was outdated string handling in test code that conflicted with newer Go language specifications. The solution was to replace it with byte slice conversion to correctly handle binary data.\n    - Action: edit 'const binaryValue = string(128)' 'const binaryValue = string([]byte{0x80})'\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\",\"instance_template\":\"We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\\n\\n{{repo_related_info}}\\n\\n{{cross_repo_knowledge}}\\n\\nTASK TIPS:\\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them.
