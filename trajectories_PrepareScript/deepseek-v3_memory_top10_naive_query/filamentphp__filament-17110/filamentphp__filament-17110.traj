Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '8.1'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - mbstring\n  - pdo\n  - pdo_sqlite\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The build and installation step for the project was omitted in the environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project's test execution requires the package to be installed locally, as specified in the CI configuration, but this step was skipped initially. Without installation, the tests lacked access to compiled components and dependencies, causing internal errors and test failures. The solution was to add the installation command to properly configure the environment before running tests.\n    - Action: python3 setup.py install\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Permission denied error occurs when running tests as a non-root user due to insufficient access rights on the build directory.\n    - Solution: The build directory lacked write permissions for the non-root user, preventing test execution. The root cause was incorrect ownership settings for project files. The solution was to recursively change ownership of the project directory to grant necessary access.\n    - Action: chown -R testuser:testuser /home/tokio\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test runner command was unavailable despite dependency installation attempts\n    - Solution: Pytest was not found in the PATH after dependency installation attempts failed due to unresolved package conflicts. The root cause was partial dependency installation failure preventing test runner availability. The solution was to explicitly install pytest and its required plugins separately to ensure the test command became executable.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install -U pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because a required build tool was not installed\n    - Solution: The cargo-hack tool was not installed on the system, which is necessary for running comprehensive tests as specified in the project's CI configuration. The root cause was a missing tool dependency in the environment setup, as cargo-hack is an external utility not included in the default Rust installation. The solution was to install it using the cargo package manager.\n    - Action: cargo install cargo-hack\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test command file was missing at the required path during environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect path specification when creating the test command file, leading to the file not being found by the submission command. The solution was to create the file at the correct absolute path using the echo command to ensure the test command is accessible.\n    - Action: echo \"npm test -- --verbose\" > /home/test_commands.sh\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to create the file at the correct absolute path using the echo command to ensure the test command is accessible.\n    - Action: echo \"npm test -- --verbose\" > /home/test_commands.sh\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '8.1'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - mbstring\n  - pdo\n  - pdo_sqlite\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The build and installation step for the project was omitted in the environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project's test execution requires the package to be installed locally, as specified in the CI configuration, but this step was skipped initially. Without installation, the tests lacked access to compiled components and dependencies, causing internal errors and test failures. The solution was to add the installation command to properly configure the environment before running tests.\n    - Action: python3 setup.py install\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Permission denied error occurs when running tests as a non-root user due to insufficient access rights on the build directory.\n    - Solution: The build directory lacked write permissions for the non-root user, preventing test execution. The root cause was incorrect ownership settings for project files. The solution was to recursively change ownership of the project directory to grant necessary access.\n    - Action: chown -R testuser:testuser /home/tokio\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test runner command was unavailable despite dependency installation attempts\n    - Solution: Pytest was not found in the PATH after dependency installation attempts failed due to unresolved package conflicts. The root cause was partial dependency installation failure preventing test runner availability. The solution was to explicitly install pytest and its required plugins separately to ensure the test command became executable.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install -U pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because a required build tool was not installed\n    - Solution: The cargo-hack tool was not installed on the system, which is necessary for running comprehensive tests as specified in the project's CI configuration. The root cause was a missing tool dependency in the environment setup, as cargo-hack is an external utility not included in the default Rust installation. The solution was to install it using the cargo package manager.\n    - Action: cargo install cargo-hack\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test command file was missing at the required path during environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect path specification when creating the test command file, leading to the file not being found by the submission command.

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '8.1'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - mbstring\n  - pdo\n  - pdo_sqlite\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The build and installation step for the project was omitted in the environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project's test execution requires the package to be installed locally, as specified in the CI configuration, but this step was skipped initially. Without installation, the tests lacked access to compiled components and dependencies, causing internal errors and test failures. The solution was to add the installation command to properly configure the environment before running tests.\n    - Action: python3 setup.py install\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Permission denied error occurs when running tests as a non-root user due to insufficient access rights on the build directory.\n    - Solution: The build directory lacked write permissions for the non-root user, preventing test execution. The root cause was incorrect ownership settings for project files. The solution was to recursively change ownership of the project directory to grant necessary access.\n    - Action: chown -R testuser:testuser /home/tokio\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test runner command was unavailable despite dependency installation attempts\n    - Solution: Pytest was not found in the PATH after dependency installation attempts failed due to unresolved package conflicts. The root cause was partial dependency installation failure preventing test runner availability. The solution was to explicitly install pytest and its required plugins separately to ensure the test command became executable.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install -U pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because a required build tool was not installed\n    - Solution: The cargo-hack tool was not installed on the system, which is necessary for running comprehensive tests as specified in the project's CI configuration. The root cause was a missing tool dependency in the environment setup, as cargo-hack is an external utility not included in the default Rust installation. The solution was to install it using the cargo package manager.\n    - Action: cargo install cargo-hack\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test command file was missing at the required path during environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect path specification when creating the test command file, leading to the file not being found by the submission command. The solution was to create the file at the correct absolute path using the echo command to ensure the test command is accessible.\n    - Action: echo \"npm test -- --verbose\" > /home/test_commands.sh\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '8.1'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - mbstring\n  - pdo\n  - pdo_sqlite\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The build and installation step for the project was omitted in the environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project's test execution requires the package to be installed locally, as specified in the CI configuration, but this step was skipped initially. Without installation, the tests lacked access to compiled components and dependencies, causing internal errors and test failures. The solution was to add the installation command to properly configure the environment before running tests.\n    - Action: python3 setup.py install\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Permission denied error occurs when running tests as a non-root user due to insufficient access rights on the build directory.\n    - Solution: The build directory lacked write permissions for the non-root user, preventing test execution. The root cause was incorrect ownership settings for project files. The solution was to recursively change ownership of the project directory to grant necessary access.\n    - Action: chown -R testuser:testuser /home/tokio\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test runner command was unavailable despite dependency installation attempts\n    - Solution: Pytest was not found in the PATH after dependency installation attempts failed due to unresolved package conflicts. The root cause was partial dependency installation failure preventing test runner availability. The solution was to explicitly install pytest and its required plugins separately to ensure the test command became executable.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install -U pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because a required build tool was not installed\n    - Solution: The cargo-hack tool was not installed on the system, which is necessary for running comprehensive tests as specified in the project's CI configuration. The root cause was a missing tool dependency in the environment setup, as cargo-hack is an external utility not included in the default Rust installation. The solution was to install it using the cargo package manager.\n    - Action: cargo install cargo-hack\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test command file was missing at the required path during environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect path specification when creating the test command file, leading to the file not being found by the submission command. The solution was to create the file at the correct absolute path using the echo command to ensure the test command is accessible.\n    - Action: echo \"npm test -- --verbose\" > /home/test_commands.sh\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '8.1'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - mbstring\n  - pdo\n  - pdo_sqlite\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The build and installation step for the project was omitted in the environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project's test execution requires the package to be installed locally, as specified in the CI configuration, but this step was skipped initially. Without installation, the tests lacked access to compiled components and dependencies, causing internal errors and test failures. The solution was to add the installation command to properly configure the environment before running tests.\n    - Action: python3 setup.py install\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Permission denied error occurs when running tests as a non-root user due to insufficient access rights on the build directory.\n    - Solution: The build directory lacked write permissions for the non-root user, preventing test execution. The root cause was incorrect ownership settings for project files. The solution was to recursively change ownership of the project directory to grant necessary access.\n    - Action: chown -R testuser:testuser /home/tokio\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test runner command was unavailable despite dependency installation attempts\n    - Solution: Pytest was not found in the PATH after dependency installation attempts failed due to unresolved package conflicts. The root cause was partial dependency installation failure preventing test runner availability. The solution was to explicitly install pytest and its required plugins separately to ensure the test command became executable.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install -U pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because a required build tool was not installed\n    - Solution: The cargo-hack tool was not installed on the system, which is necessary for running comprehensive tests as specified in the project's CI configuration. The root cause was a missing tool dependency in the environment setup, as cargo-hack is an external utility not included in the default Rust installation. The solution was to install it using the cargo package manager.\n    - Action: cargo install cargo-hack\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test command file was missing at the required path during environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect path specification when creating the test command file, leading to the file not being found by the submission command. The solution was to create the file at the correct absolute path using the echo command to ensure the test command is accessible.\n    - Action: echo \"npm test -- --verbose\" > /home/test_commands.sh\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '8.1'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - mbstring\n  - pdo\n  - pdo_sqlite\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The build and installation step for the project was omitted in the environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project's test execution requires the package to be installed locally, as specified in the CI configuration, but this step was skipped initially. Without installation, the tests lacked access to compiled components and dependencies, causing internal errors and test failures. The solution was to add the installation command to properly configure the environment before running tests.\n    - Action: python3 setup.py install\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Permission denied error occurs when running tests as a non-root user due to insufficient access rights on the build directory.\n    - Solution: The build directory lacked write permissions for the non-root user, preventing test execution. The root cause was incorrect ownership settings for project files. The solution was to recursively change ownership of the project directory to grant necessary access.\n    - Action: chown -R testuser:testuser /home/tokio\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test runner command was unavailable despite dependency installation attempts\n    - Solution: Pytest was not found in the PATH after dependency installation attempts failed due to unresolved package conflicts. The root cause was partial dependency installation failure preventing test runner availability. The solution was to explicitly install pytest and its required plugins separately to ensure the test command became executable.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install -U pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because a required build tool was not installed\n    - Solution: The cargo-hack tool was not installed on the system, which is necessary for running comprehensive tests as specified in the project's CI configuration. The root cause was a missing tool dependency in the environment setup, as cargo-hack is an external utility not included in the default Rust installation. The solution was to install it using the cargo package manager.\n    - Action: cargo install cargo-hack\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test command file was missing at the required path during environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect path specification when creating the test command file, leading to the file not being found by the submission command. The solution was to create the file at the correct absolute path using the echo command to ensure the test command is accessible.\n    - Action: echo \"npm test -- --verbose\" > /home/test_commands.sh\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '8.1'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - mbstring\n  - pdo\n  - pdo_sqlite\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The build and installation step for the project was omitted in the environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project's test execution requires the package to be installed locally, as specified in the CI configuration, but this step was skipped initially. Without installation, the tests lacked access to compiled components and dependencies, causing internal errors and test failures. The solution was to add the installation command to properly configure the environment before running tests.\n    - Action: python3 setup.py install\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Permission denied error occurs when running tests as a non-root user due to insufficient access rights on the build directory.\n    - Solution: The build directory lacked write permissions for the non-root user, preventing test execution. The root cause was incorrect ownership settings for project files. The solution was to recursively change ownership of the project directory to grant necessary access.\n    - Action: chown -R testuser:testuser /home/tokio\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test runner command was unavailable despite dependency installation attempts\n    - Solution: Pytest was not found in the PATH after dependency installation attempts failed due to unresolved package conflicts. The root cause was partial dependency installation failure preventing test runner availability. The solution was to explicitly install pytest and its required plugins separately to ensure the test command became executable.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install -U pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because a required build tool was not installed\n    - Solution: The cargo-hack tool was not installed on the system, which is necessary for running comprehensive tests as specified in the project's CI configuration. The root cause was a missing tool dependency in the environment setup, as cargo-hack is an external utility not included in the default Rust installation. The solution was to install it using the cargo package manager.\n    - Action: cargo install cargo-hack\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test command file was missing at the required path during environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect path specification when creating the test command file, leading to the file not being found by the submission command. The solution was to create the file at the correct absolute path using the echo command to ensure the test command is accessible.\n    - Action: echo \"npm test -- --verbose\" > /home/test_commands.sh\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '8.1'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - mbstring\n  - pdo\n  - pdo_sqlite\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The build and installation step for the project was omitted in the environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project's test execution requires the package to be installed locally, as specified in the CI configuration, but this step was skipped initially. Without installation, the tests lacked access to compiled components and dependencies, causing internal errors and test failures. The solution was to add the installation command to properly configure the environment before running tests.\n    - Action: python3 setup.py install\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Permission denied error occurs when running tests as a non-root user due to insufficient access rights on the build directory.\n    - Solution: The build directory lacked write permissions for the non-root user, preventing test execution. The root cause was incorrect ownership settings for project files. The solution was to recursively change ownership of the project directory to grant necessary access.\n    - Action: chown -R testuser:testuser /home/tokio\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test runner command was unavailable despite dependency installation attempts\n    - Solution: Pytest was not found in the PATH after dependency installation attempts failed due to unresolved package conflicts. The root cause was partial dependency installation failure preventing test runner availability. The solution was to explicitly install pytest and its required plugins separately to ensure the test command became executable.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install -U pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because a required build tool was not installed\n    - Solution: The cargo-hack tool was not installed on the system, which is necessary for running comprehensive tests as specified in the project's CI configuration. The root cause was a missing tool dependency in the environment setup, as cargo-hack is an external utility not included in the default Rust installation. The solution was to install it using the cargo package manager.\n    - Action: cargo install cargo-hack\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test command file was missing at the required path during environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect path specification when creating the test command file, leading to the file not being found by the submission command. The solution was to create the file at the correct absolute path using the echo command to ensure the test command is accessible.\n    - Action: echo \"npm test -- --verbose\" > /home/test_commands.sh\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '8.1'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - mbstring\n  - pdo\n  - pdo_sqlite\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The build and installation step for the project was omitted in the environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project's test execution requires the package to be installed locally, as specified in the CI configuration, but this step was skipped initially. Without installation, the tests lacked access to compiled components and dependencies, causing internal errors and test failures. The solution was to add the installation command to properly configure the environment before running tests.\n    - Action: python3 setup.py install\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Permission denied error occurs when running tests as a non-root user due to insufficient access rights on the build directory.\n    - Solution: The build directory lacked write permissions for the non-root user, preventing test execution. The root cause was incorrect ownership settings for project files. The solution was to recursively change ownership of the project directory to grant necessary access.\n    - Action: chown -R testuser:testuser /home/tokio\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test runner command was unavailable despite dependency installation attempts\n    - Solution: Pytest was not found in the PATH after dependency installation attempts failed due to unresolved package conflicts. The root cause was partial dependency installation failure preventing test runner availability. The solution was to explicitly install pytest and its required plugins separately to ensure the test command became executable.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install -U pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because a required build tool was not installed\n    - Solution: The cargo-hack tool was not installed on the system, which is necessary for running comprehensive tests as specified in the project's CI configuration. The root cause was a missing tool dependency in the environment setup, as cargo-hack is an external utility not included in the default Rust installation. The solution was to install it using the cargo package manager.\n    - Action: cargo install cargo-hack\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test command file was missing at the required path during environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect path specification when creating the test command file, leading to the file not being found by the submission command. The solution was to create the file at the correct absolute path using the echo command to ensure the test command is accessible.\n    - Action: echo \"npm test -- --verbose\" > /home/test_commands.sh\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '8.1'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - mbstring\n  - pdo\n  - pdo_sqlite\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The build and installation step for the project was omitted in the environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project's test execution requires the package to be installed locally, as specified in the CI configuration, but this step was skipped initially. Without installation, the tests lacked access to compiled components and dependencies, causing internal errors and test failures. The solution was to add the installation command to properly configure the environment before running tests.\n    - Action: python3 setup.py install\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Permission denied error occurs when running tests as a non-root user due to insufficient access rights on the build directory.\n    - Solution: The build directory lacked write permissions for the non-root user, preventing test execution. The root cause was incorrect ownership settings for project files. The solution was to recursively change ownership of the project directory to grant necessary access.\n    - Action: chown -R testuser:testuser /home/tokio\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test runner command was unavailable despite dependency installation attempts\n    - Solution: Pytest was not found in the PATH after dependency installation attempts failed due to unresolved package conflicts. The root cause was partial dependency installation failure preventing test runner availability. The solution was to explicitly install pytest and its required plugins separately to ensure the test command became executable.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install -U pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because a required build tool was not installed\n    - Solution: The cargo-hack tool was not installed on the system, which is necessary for running comprehensive tests as specified in the project's CI configuration. The root cause was a missing tool dependency in the environment setup, as cargo-hack is an external utility not included in the default Rust installation. The solution was to install it using the cargo package manager.\n    - Action: cargo install cargo-hack\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test command file was missing at the required path during environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect path specification when creating the test command file, leading to the file not being found by the submission command. The solution was to create the file at the correct absolute path using the echo command to ensure the test command is accessible.\n    - Action: echo \"npm test -- --verbose\" > /home/test_commands.sh\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '8.1'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - mbstring\n  - pdo\n  - pdo_sqlite\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The build and installation step for the project was omitted in the environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project's test execution requires the package to be installed locally, as specified in the CI configuration, but this step was skipped initially. Without installation, the tests lacked access to compiled components and dependencies, causing internal errors and test failures. The solution was to add the installation command to properly configure the environment before running tests.\n    - Action: python3 setup.py install\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Permission denied error occurs when running tests as a non-root user due to insufficient access rights on the build directory.\n    - Solution: The build directory lacked write permissions for the non-root user, preventing test execution. The root cause was incorrect ownership settings for project files. The solution was to recursively change ownership of the project directory to grant necessary access.\n    - Action: chown -R testuser:testuser /home/tokio\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test runner command was unavailable despite dependency installation attempts\n    - Solution: Pytest was not found in the PATH after dependency installation attempts failed due to unresolved package conflicts. The root cause was partial dependency installation failure preventing test runner availability. The solution was to explicitly install pytest and its required plugins separately to ensure the test command became executable.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install -U pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because a required build tool was not installed\n    - Solution: The cargo-hack tool was not installed on the system, which is necessary for running comprehensive tests as specified in the project's CI configuration. The root cause was a missing tool dependency in the environment setup, as cargo-hack is an external utility not included in the default Rust installation. The solution was to install it using the cargo package manager.\n    - Action: cargo install cargo-hack\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test command file was missing at the required path during environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect path specification when creating the test command file, leading to the file not being found by the submission command. The solution was to create the file at the correct absolute path using the echo command to ensure the test command is accessible.\n    - Action: echo \"npm test -- --verbose\" > /home/test_commands.sh\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '8.1'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - mbstring\n  - pdo\n  - pdo_sqlite\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The build and installation step for the project was omitted in the environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project's test execution requires the package to be installed locally, as specified in the CI configuration, but this step was skipped initially. Without installation, the tests lacked access to compiled components and dependencies, causing internal errors and test failures. The solution was to add the installation command to properly configure the environment before running tests.\n    - Action: python3 setup.py install\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Permission denied error occurs when running tests as a non-root user due to insufficient access rights on the build directory.\n    - Solution: The build directory lacked write permissions for the non-root user, preventing test execution. The root cause was incorrect ownership settings for project files. The solution was to recursively change ownership of the project directory to grant necessary access.\n    - Action: chown -R testuser:testuser /home/tokio\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test runner command was unavailable despite dependency installation attempts\n    - Solution: Pytest was not found in the PATH after dependency installation attempts failed due to unresolved package conflicts. The root cause was partial dependency installation failure preventing test runner availability. The solution was to explicitly install pytest and its required plugins separately to ensure the test command became executable.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install -U pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because a required build tool was not installed\n    - Solution: The cargo-hack tool was not installed on the system, which is necessary for running comprehensive tests as specified in the project's CI configuration. The root cause was a missing tool dependency in the environment setup, as cargo-hack is an external utility not included in the default Rust installation. The solution was to install it using the cargo package manager.\n    - Action: cargo install cargo-hack\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test command file was missing at the required path during environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect path specification when creating the test command file, leading to the file not being found by the submission command. The solution was to create the file at the correct absolute path using the echo command to ensure the test command is accessible.\n    - Action: echo \"npm test -- --verbose\" > /home/test_commands.sh\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '8.1'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - mbstring\n  - pdo\n  - pdo_sqlite\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The build and installation step for the project was omitted in the environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project's test execution requires the package to be installed locally, as specified in the CI configuration, but this step was skipped initially. Without installation, the tests lacked access to compiled components and dependencies, causing internal errors and test failures. The solution was to add the installation command to properly configure the environment before running tests.\n    - Action: python3 setup.py install\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Permission denied error occurs when running tests as a non-root user due to insufficient access rights on the build directory.\n    - Solution: The build directory lacked write permissions for the non-root user, preventing test execution. The root cause was incorrect ownership settings for project files. The solution was to recursively change ownership of the project directory to grant necessary access.\n    - Action: chown -R testuser:testuser /home/tokio\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test runner command was unavailable despite dependency installation attempts\n    - Solution: Pytest was not found in the PATH after dependency installation attempts failed due to unresolved package conflicts. The root cause was partial dependency installation failure preventing test runner availability. The solution was to explicitly install pytest and its required plugins separately to ensure the test command became executable.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install -U pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because a required build tool was not installed\n    - Solution: The cargo-hack tool was not installed on the system, which is necessary for running comprehensive tests as specified in the project's CI configuration. The root cause was a missing tool dependency in the environment setup, as cargo-hack is an external utility not included in the default Rust installation. The solution was to install it using the cargo package manager.\n    - Action: cargo install cargo-hack\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test command file was missing at the required path during environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect path specification when creating the test command file, leading to the file not being found by the submission command. The solution was to create the file at the correct absolute path using the echo command to ensure the test command is accessible.\n    - Action: echo \"npm test -- --verbose\" > /home/test_commands.sh\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '8.1'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - mbstring\n  - pdo\n  - pdo_sqlite\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The build and installation step for the project was omitted in the environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project's test execution requires the package to be installed locally, as specified in the CI configuration, but this step was skipped initially. Without installation, the tests lacked access to compiled components and dependencies, causing internal errors and test failures. The solution was to add the installation command to properly configure the environment before running tests.\n    - Action: python3 setup.py install\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Permission denied error occurs when running tests as a non-root user due to insufficient access rights on the build directory.\n    - Solution: The build directory lacked write permissions for the non-root user, preventing test execution. The root cause was incorrect ownership settings for project files. The solution was to recursively change ownership of the project directory to grant necessary access.\n    - Action: chown -R testuser:testuser /home/tokio\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test runner command was unavailable despite dependency installation attempts\n    - Solution: Pytest was not found in the PATH after dependency installation attempts failed due to unresolved package conflicts. The root cause was partial dependency installation failure preventing test runner availability. The solution was to explicitly install pytest and its required plugins separately to ensure the test command became executable.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install -U pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because a required build tool was not installed\n    - Solution: The cargo-hack tool was not installed on the system, which is necessary for running comprehensive tests as specified in the project's CI configuration. The root cause was a missing tool dependency in the environment setup, as cargo-hack is an external utility not included in the default Rust installation. The solution was to install it using the cargo package manager.\n    - Action: cargo install cargo-hack\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test command file was missing at the required path during environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect path specification when creating the test command file, leading to the file not being found by the submission command. The solution was to create the file at the correct absolute path using the echo command to ensure the test command is accessible.\n    - Action: echo \"npm test -- --verbose\" > /home/test_commands.sh\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '8.1'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - mbstring\n  - pdo\n  - pdo_sqlite\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The build and installation step for the project was omitted in the environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project's test execution requires the package to be installed locally, as specified in the CI configuration, but this step was skipped initially. Without installation, the tests lacked access to compiled components and dependencies, causing internal errors and test failures. The solution was to add the installation command to properly configure the environment before running tests.\n    - Action: python3 setup.py install\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Permission denied error occurs when running tests as a non-root user due to insufficient access rights on the build directory.\n    - Solution: The build directory lacked write permissions for the non-root user, preventing test execution. The root cause was incorrect ownership settings for project files. The solution was to recursively change ownership of the project directory to grant necessary access.\n    - Action: chown -R testuser:testuser /home/tokio\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test runner command was unavailable despite dependency installation attempts\n    - Solution: Pytest was not found in the PATH after dependency installation attempts failed due to unresolved package conflicts. The root cause was partial dependency installation failure preventing test runner availability. The solution was to explicitly install pytest and its required plugins separately to ensure the test command became executable.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install -U pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because a required build tool was not installed\n    - Solution: The cargo-hack tool was not installed on the system, which is necessary for running comprehensive tests as specified in the project's CI configuration. The root cause was a missing tool dependency in the environment setup, as cargo-hack is an external utility not included in the default Rust installation. The solution was to install it using the cargo package manager.\n    - Action: cargo install cargo-hack\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test command file was missing at the required path during environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect path specification when creating the test command file, leading to the file not being found by the submission command. The solution was to create the file at the correct absolute path using the echo command to ensure the test command is accessible.\n    - Action: echo \"npm test -- --verbose\" > /home/test_commands.sh\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '8.1'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - mbstring\n  - pdo\n  - pdo_sqlite\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The build and installation step for the project was omitted in the environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project's test execution requires the package to be installed locally, as specified in the CI configuration, but this step was skipped initially. Without installation, the tests lacked access to compiled components and dependencies, causing internal errors and test failures. The solution was to add the installation command to properly configure the environment before running tests.\n    - Action: python3 setup.py install\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Permission denied error occurs when running tests as a non-root user due to insufficient access rights on the build directory.\n    - Solution: The build directory lacked write permissions for the non-root user, preventing test execution. The root cause was incorrect ownership settings for project files. The solution was to recursively change ownership of the project directory to grant necessary access.\n    - Action: chown -R testuser:testuser /home/tokio\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test runner command was unavailable despite dependency installation attempts\n    - Solution: Pytest was not found in the PATH after dependency installation attempts failed due to unresolved package conflicts. The root cause was partial dependency installation failure preventing test runner availability. The solution was to explicitly install pytest and its required plugins separately to ensure the test command became executable.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install -U pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because a required build tool was not installed\n    - Solution: The cargo-hack tool was not installed on the system, which is necessary for running comprehensive tests as specified in the project's CI configuration. The root cause was a missing tool dependency in the environment setup, as cargo-hack is an external utility not included in the default Rust installation. The solution was to install it using the cargo package manager.\n    - Action: cargo install cargo-hack\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test command file was missing at the required path during environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect path specification when creating the test command file, leading to the file not being found by the submission command. The solution was to create the file at the correct absolute path using the echo command to ensure the test command is accessible.\n    - Action: echo \"npm test -- --verbose\" > /home/test_commands.sh\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '8.1'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - mbstring\n  - pdo\n  - pdo_sqlite\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The build and installation step for the project was omitted in the environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project's test execution requires the package to be installed locally, as specified in the CI configuration, but this step was skipped initially. Without installation, the tests lacked access to compiled components and dependencies, causing internal errors and test failures. The solution was to add the installation command to properly configure the environment before running tests.\n    - Action: python3 setup.py install\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Permission denied error occurs when running tests as a non-root user due to insufficient access rights on the build directory.\n    - Solution: The build directory lacked write permissions for the non-root user, preventing test execution. The root cause was incorrect ownership settings for project files. The solution was to recursively change ownership of the project directory to grant necessary access.\n    - Action: chown -R testuser:testuser /home/tokio\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test runner command was unavailable despite dependency installation attempts\n    - Solution: Pytest was not found in the PATH after dependency installation attempts failed due to unresolved package conflicts. The root cause was partial dependency installation failure preventing test runner availability. The solution was to explicitly install pytest and its required plugins separately to ensure the test command became executable.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install -U pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because a required build tool was not installed\n    - Solution: The cargo-hack tool was not installed on the system, which is necessary for running comprehensive tests as specified in the project's CI configuration. The root cause was a missing tool dependency in the environment setup, as cargo-hack is an external utility not included in the default Rust installation. The solution was to install it using the cargo package manager.\n    - Action: cargo install cargo-hack\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test command file was missing at the required path during environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect path specification when creating the test command file, leading to the file not being found by the submission command. The solution was to create the file at the correct absolute path using the echo command to ensure the test command is accessible.\n    - Action: echo \"npm test -- --verbose\" > /home/test_commands.sh\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to add the installation command to properly configure the environment before running tests.\n    - Action: python3 setup.py install\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Permission denied error occurs when running tests as a non-root user due to insufficient access rights on the build directory.\n    - Solution: The build directory lacked write permissions for the non-root user, preventing test execution. The root cause was incorrect ownership settings for project files. The solution was to recursively change ownership of the project directory to grant necessary access.\n    - Action: chown -R testuser:testuser /home/tokio\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test runner command was unavailable despite dependency installation attempts\n    - Solution: Pytest was not found in the PATH after dependency installation attempts failed due to unresolved package conflicts. The root cause was partial dependency installation failure preventing test runner availability. The solution was to explicitly install pytest and its required plugins separately to ensure the test command became executable.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install -U pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because a required build tool was not installed\n    - Solution: The cargo-hack tool was not installed on the system, which is necessary for running comprehensive tests as specified in the project's CI configuration. The root cause was a missing tool dependency in the environment setup, as cargo-hack is an external utility not included in the default Rust installation. The solution was to install it using the cargo package manager.\n    - Action: cargo install cargo-hack\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test command file was missing at the required path during environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect path specification when creating the test command file, leading to the file not being found by the submission command. The solution was to create the file at the correct absolute path using the echo command to ensure the test command is accessible.\n    - Action: echo \"npm test -- --verbose\" > /home/test_commands.sh\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '8.1'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - mbstring\n  - pdo\n  - pdo_sqlite\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The build and installation step for the project was omitted in the environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project's test execution requires the package to be installed locally, as specified in the CI configuration, but this step was skipped initially. Without installation, the tests lacked access to compiled components and dependencies, causing internal errors and test failures. The solution was to add the installation command to properly configure the environment before running tests.\n    - Action: python3 setup.py install\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Permission denied error occurs when running tests as a non-root user due to insufficient access rights on the build directory.\n    - Solution: The build directory lacked write permissions for the non-root user, preventing test execution. The root cause was incorrect ownership settings for project files. The solution was to recursively change ownership of the project directory to grant necessary access.\n    - Action: chown -R testuser:testuser /home/tokio\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test runner command was unavailable despite dependency installation attempts\n    - Solution: Pytest was not found in the PATH after dependency installation attempts failed due to unresolved package conflicts. The root cause was partial dependency installation failure preventing test runner availability. The solution was to explicitly install pytest and its required plugins separately to ensure the test command became executable.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install -U pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because a required build tool was not installed\n    - Solution: The cargo-hack tool was not installed on the system, which is necessary for running comprehensive tests as specified in the project's CI configuration. The root cause was a missing tool dependency in the environment setup, as cargo-hack is an external utility not included in the default Rust installation. The solution was to install it using the cargo package manager.\n    - Action: cargo install cargo-hack\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test command file was missing at the required path during environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect path specification when creating the test command file, leading to the file not being found by the submission command. The solution was to create the file at the correct absolute path using the echo command to ensure the test command is accessible.\n    - Action: echo \"npm test -- --verbose\" > /home/test_commands.sh\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to add the installation command to properly configure the environment before running tests.\n    - Action: python3 setup.py install\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Permission denied error occurs when running tests as a non-root user due to insufficient access rights on the build directory.\n    - Solution: The build directory lacked write permissions for the non-root user, preventing test execution. The root cause was incorrect ownership settings for project files. The solution was to recursively change ownership of the project directory to grant necessary access.\n    - Action: chown -R testuser:testuser /home/tokio\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test runner command was unavailable despite dependency installation attempts\n    - Solution: Pytest was not found in the PATH after dependency installation attempts failed due to unresolved package conflicts. The root cause was partial dependency installation failure preventing test runner availability. The solution was to explicitly install pytest and its required plugins separately to ensure the test command became executable.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install -U pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because a required build tool was not installed\n    - Solution: The cargo-hack tool was not installed on the system, which is necessary for running comprehensive tests as specified in the project's CI configuration. The root cause was a missing tool dependency in the environment setup, as cargo-hack is an external utility not included in the default Rust installation. The solution was to install it using the cargo package manager.\n    - Action: cargo install cargo-hack\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test command file was missing at the required path during environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect path specification when creating the test command file, leading to the file not being found by the submission command. The solution was to create the file at the correct absolute path using the echo command to ensure the test command is accessible.\n    - Action: echo \"npm test -- --verbose\" > /home/test_commands.sh\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '8.1'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - mbstring\n  - pdo\n  - pdo_sqlite\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The build and installation step for the project was omitted in the environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project's test execution requires the package to be installed locally, as specified in the CI configuration, but this step was skipped initially. Without installation, the tests lacked access to compiled components and dependencies, causing internal errors and test failures. The solution was to add the installation command to properly configure the environment before running tests.\n    - Action: python3 setup.py install\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Permission denied error occurs when running tests as a non-root user due to insufficient access rights on the build directory.\n    - Solution: The build directory lacked write permissions for the non-root user, preventing test execution. The root cause was incorrect ownership settings for project files. The solution was to recursively change ownership of the project directory to grant necessary access.\n    - Action: chown -R testuser:testuser /home/tokio\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test runner command was unavailable despite dependency installation attempts\n    - Solution: Pytest was not found in the PATH after dependency installation attempts failed due to unresolved package conflicts. The root cause was partial dependency installation failure preventing test runner availability. The solution was to explicitly install pytest and its required plugins separately to ensure the test command became executable.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install -U pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because a required build tool was not installed\n    - Solution: The cargo-hack tool was not installed on the system, which is necessary for running comprehensive tests as specified in the project's CI configuration. The root cause was a missing tool dependency in the environment setup, as cargo-hack is an external utility not included in the default Rust installation. The solution was to install it using the cargo package manager.\n    - Action: cargo install cargo-hack\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test command file was missing at the required path during environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect path specification when creating the test command file, leading to the file not being found by the submission command. The solution was to create the file at the correct absolute path using the echo command to ensure the test command is accessible.\n    - Action: echo \"npm test -- --verbose\" > /home/test_commands.sh\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '8.1'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - mbstring\n  - pdo\n  - pdo_sqlite\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The build and installation step for the project was omitted in the environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project's test execution requires the package to be installed locally, as specified in the CI configuration, but this step was skipped initially. Without installation, the tests lacked access to compiled components and dependencies, causing internal errors and test failures. The solution was to add the installation command to properly configure the environment before running tests.\n    - Action: python3 setup.py install\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Permission denied error occurs when running tests as a non-root user due to insufficient access rights on the build directory.\n    - Solution: The build directory lacked write permissions for the non-root user, preventing test execution. The root cause was incorrect ownership settings for project files. The solution was to recursively change ownership of the project directory to grant necessary access.\n    - Action: chown -R testuser:testuser /home/tokio\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test runner command was unavailable despite dependency installation attempts\n    - Solution: Pytest was not found in the PATH after dependency installation attempts failed due to unresolved package conflicts. The root cause was partial dependency installation failure preventing test runner availability. The solution was to explicitly install pytest and its required plugins separately to ensure the test command became executable.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install -U pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because a required build tool was not installed\n    - Solution: The cargo-hack tool was not installed on the system, which is necessary for running comprehensive tests as specified in the project's CI configuration. The root cause was a missing tool dependency in the environment setup, as cargo-hack is an external utility not included in the default Rust installation. The solution was to install it using the cargo package manager.\n    - Action: cargo install cargo-hack\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test command file was missing at the required path during environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect path specification when creating the test command file, leading to the file not being found by the submission command. The solution was to create the file at the correct absolute path using the echo command to ensure the test command is accessible.\n    - Action: echo \"npm test -- --verbose\" > /home/test_commands.sh\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT!

      "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '8.1'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - mbstring\n  - pdo\n  - pdo_sqlite\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The build and installation step for the project was omitted in the environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was that the project's test execution requires the package to be installed locally, as specified in the CI configuration, but this step was skipped initially. Without installation, the tests lacked access to compiled components and dependencies, causing internal errors and test failures. The solution was to add the installation command to properly configure the environment before running tests.\n    - Action: python3 setup.py install\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Permission denied error occurs when running tests as a non-root user due to insufficient access rights on the build directory.\n    - Solution: The build directory lacked write permissions for the non-root user, preventing test execution. The root cause was incorrect ownership settings for project files. The solution was to recursively change ownership of the project directory to grant necessary access.\n    - Action: chown -R testuser:testuser /home/tokio\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test runner command was unavailable despite dependency installation attempts\n    - Solution: Pytest was not found in the PATH after dependency installation attempts failed due to unresolved package conflicts. The root cause was partial dependency installation failure preventing test runner availability. The solution was to explicitly install pytest and its required plugins separately to ensure the test command became executable.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install -U pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because a required build tool was not installed\n    - Solution: The cargo-hack tool was not installed on the system, which is necessary for running comprehensive tests as specified in the project's CI configuration. The root cause was a missing tool dependency in the environment setup, as cargo-hack is an external utility not included in the default Rust installation. The solution was to install it using the cargo package manager.\n    - Action: cargo install cargo-hack\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test command file was missing at the required path during environment setup\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect path specification when creating the test command file, leading to the file not being found by the submission command. The solution was to create the file at the correct absolute path using the echo command to ensure the test command is accessible.\n    - Action: echo \"npm test -- --verbose\" > /home/test_commands.sh\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT!

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\\n\\n{{repo_related_info}}\\n\\n{{cross_repo_knowledge}}\\n\\nTASK TIPS:\\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them.
