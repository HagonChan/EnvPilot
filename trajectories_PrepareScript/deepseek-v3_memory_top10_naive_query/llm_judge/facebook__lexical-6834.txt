"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The unit tests (`npm run test-unit`) completed successfully with 1637 tests passing and 2 skipped. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, meeting the first success criterion.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The successful execution of unit tests demonstrates that the core modules can be imported and used normally. The tests verify basic API calls and core features, meeting the second success criterion.\n\nWhile the integration tests encountered issues, the success criteria only require that at least one complete test suite executes successfully, which was achieved with the unit tests. The integration test failures are related to environment-specific issues with Playwright and server startup, which don't affect the core functionality verification."
