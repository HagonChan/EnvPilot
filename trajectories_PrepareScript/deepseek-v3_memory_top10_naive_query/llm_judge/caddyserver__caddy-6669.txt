"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed multiple test suites (`go test ./...` and `go test -v ./...`). While some tests initially appeared to fail, a more detailed run showed all tests passing. The testing framework generated complete test reports, including verbose output for debugging.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent built the project successfully (`go build` in cmd/caddy) and verified core functionality by running tests across multiple packages. Main modules were imported and used normally, as evidenced by the test execution logs.\n3. **Environment Configuration**: The agent properly installed Go 1.23.0 (meeting version requirements), fetched all dependencies, and resolved initial tooling issues (installing wget). The setup matches the CI configuration found in .github/workflows/ci.yml.\n4. **Success Criteria Met**: Despite initial test output confusion, the final verification showed all tests passing, and the build was successful. The agent demonstrated the environment was correctly configured by achieving both test suite completion and core functionality verification."
