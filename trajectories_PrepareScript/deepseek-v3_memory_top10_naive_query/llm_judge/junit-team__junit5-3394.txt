"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The Gradle build completed successfully, and the test suite executed without critical failures. Although some tests were skipped (e.g., `GraalVmStarterTests`), the majority of the tests passed, and the test framework generated a complete report structure. This meets the success criteria for test suite execution.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core modules of the project (e.g., `junit-jupiter`, `junit-platform`) were built successfully, and the project's main functionality was verified through the Gradle build process. The build output confirms that the core features are operational.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning:\n- **Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution)**: The Gradle build (`./gradlew build`) completed successfully, indicating that the test suite executed as expected. The `GraalVmStarterTests` test was disabled due to a missing project dependency, but this is non-critical as it was explicitly skipped with a valid reason. The test framework generated reports, and the build output confirmed the execution of other tests.\n- **Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification)**: The build process included tasks for core modules like `junit-jupiter-api`, `junit-jupiter-engine`, and `junit-platform-commons`, all of which completed successfully. This confirms that the core functionality is intact and operational.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful as both critical conditions are met: the test suite executed, and the core functionality is verified."
