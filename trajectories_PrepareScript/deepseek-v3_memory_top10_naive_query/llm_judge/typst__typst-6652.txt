"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite completed successfully with all unit tests passing. The output shows that multiple test suites (unit tests, doc tests, and integration tests) were executed without any critical failures. Some tests were ignored as expected, but this does not affect the overall success.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality was verified as the main modules were successfully compiled and imported. The test output confirms that the core features are operational, and the project's main functional modules can be used normally. The successful execution of the test suite also implies that basic API calls and core features are working as expected.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria, as the test suite completed successfully and the core functionality was verified."
