"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The Maven build process successfully executed multiple test suites including the main Gson tests, Java Platform Module System tests, and GraalVM Native Image tests. While the Code shrinking test failed due to an external dependency issue, this is not critical as the primary test suites completed successfully and generated reports.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core Gson module was successfully built and its basic functionality can be verified through the successful execution of multiple test suites. The main build process completed for the core components, indicating the core functionality is operational.\n\nThe failure in the Code shrinking test is related to an external dependency resolution issue (network connectivity to maven.google.com) rather than a problem with the environment configuration or core functionality. The environment meets both success criteria as the main test suites executed successfully and core functionality is verified."
