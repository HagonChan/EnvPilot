"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite ran successfully with 1402 passed tests and 60 skipped. Although there was 1 failure, the test suite completed execution and generated a complete test report structure. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The environment was properly configured with Python 3 and all required dependencies installed. The main functional modules can be imported and used normally, as evidenced by the successful execution of the test suite. This meets Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe single test failure does not impact the overall success of the environment configuration, as the criteria focus on framework operability rather than individual test pass rates. The core functionality is verified, and the test suite completes execution."
