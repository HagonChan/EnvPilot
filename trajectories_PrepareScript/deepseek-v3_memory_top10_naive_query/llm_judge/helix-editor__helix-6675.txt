"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed the test suite for the `helix-core` package (`cargo test --package helix-core`). Although some tests related to `tree-sitter` failed (due to missing dynamic libraries), the majority of the tests (113 out of 116) passed, and the test suite completed successfully. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish, even if some individual tests fail.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent verified that the core Rust environment was correctly set up (Rust version `1.65.0` installed, system dependencies like `libssl-dev` and `build-essential` installed). The ability to run tests and compile the project confirms that the core functionality is operational, even though some optional features (like `tree-sitter`) could not be fully configured due to dependency conflicts.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful because both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) were met, despite minor issues with optional dependencies. The agent followed a systematic approach to resolve issues and demonstrated the project's basic functionality."
