"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The PHPUnit test suite successfully executed all 1800 tests with 2645 assertions, completing without any failures. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The environment was properly configured with PHP 8.1.2 and Composer 2.2.6, and all dependencies were installed successfully. The ability to run the test suite confirms that the core functionality is working as expected. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, and the main functional modules were imported and used normally during the test execution.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful as both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) are fully satisfied. All 1800 tests passed, demonstrating that the environment is correctly set up and the project's functionality is operational."
