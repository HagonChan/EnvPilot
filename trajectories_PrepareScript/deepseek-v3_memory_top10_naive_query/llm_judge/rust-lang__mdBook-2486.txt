"FAILED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite could not be executed due to persistent SSL/network issues preventing the fetching of dependencies from `crates.io`. The `cargo test` command failed to start because essential dependencies like `ammonia` could not be downloaded. This violates Condition 1 of the success criteria, which requires at least one complete test suite to execute successfully.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality could not be verified because the project could not be built due to missing dependencies. The `cargo build` command failed for the same SSL/network reasons, preventing the compilation of the project and verification of core modules. This violates Condition 2 of the success criteria, which requires core functional modules to be importable and usable.\n\nDespite successfully installing the correct Rust toolchain version (`1.74.0`) and attempting various fixes (installing SSL libraries, updating CA certificates, bypassing SSL verification, and trying offline mode), the environment configuration could not overcome the network/SSL issues to fetch dependencies. Thus, the environment configuration task did not meet either of the two success criteria."
