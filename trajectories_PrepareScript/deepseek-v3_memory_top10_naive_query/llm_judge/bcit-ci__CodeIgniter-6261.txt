"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The PHPUnit test suite executed successfully, running 337 tests with 1094 assertions. While there were 11 warnings (related to deprecated assertions) and 24 skipped tests, the test suite completed its execution and generated a complete test report structure. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality was verified through the successful execution of the test suite. The tests covered various aspects of the application, including library loading, model handling, and driver functionality. The warnings do not indicate fundamental issues with core functionality but rather deprecation notices that can be addressed in future updates. This meets Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe environment configuration was successful as both conditions were met: the test suite completed execution, and core functionality was verified through the tests. The warnings and skipped tests do not affect the overall success of the environment configuration."
