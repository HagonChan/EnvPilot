"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully with `npm test`, completing with 3534 passing tests and 48 pending tests. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, meeting the success criteria for test suite execution.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality was verified by successfully running the test suite and generating a coverage report with `npm run test-coverage`. The main functional modules were imported and used normally, and basic API calls returned expected results as evidenced by the passing tests. The Deno test was skipped due to missing Deno installation, but this does not affect the core functionality verification.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria, ensuring the project is fully functional and ready for further development or deployment."
