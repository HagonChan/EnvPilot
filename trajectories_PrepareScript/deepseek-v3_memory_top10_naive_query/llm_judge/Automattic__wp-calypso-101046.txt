"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite ran successfully with most tests passing (321 passed out of 325 total). While there were 4 test failures, the test framework completed execution and generated a complete test report structure. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully, even with some individual test failures.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The environment was properly configured with:\n   - Correct Node.js version (v22.9.0) installed via nvm\n   - Correct Yarn version (4.0.2) installed\n   - Project dependencies installed (despite some build errors)\n   - Test framework executed successfully\n\nThe test execution demonstrates that core functionality is working, as evidenced by the high number of passing tests. The few test failures don't indicate fundamental environment configuration problems, but rather potential issues with specific test cases.\n\nThe agent successfully completed the environment configuration task by meeting both success criteria - test suite execution and core functionality verification."
