"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully with all tests passing (959 OK, 0 KO, 0 Crash). The test framework generated a complete test report structure, and the suite completed without any critical errors.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules were successfully compiled and built, as evidenced by the successful execution of the build process (`rake`). The core features were demonstrated through the test execution, and the binaries (e.g., `mrbc`, `mirb`, `mruby`) were generated and verified.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria: the test suite completed successfully, and the core functionality was verified. The project is fully operational in the configured environment."
