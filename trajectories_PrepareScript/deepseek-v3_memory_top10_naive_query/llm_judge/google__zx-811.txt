"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite ran successfully with all 118 tests passing after resolving the initial issues. The testing framework generated a complete test report structure, including details about passed tests, suites, and execution times. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules were imported and used normally. The core functionality was demonstrated through the successful execution of the test suite, including unit tests, type checks, and license checks. Basic API calls returned expected results, meeting Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\n**Detailed Reasoning**:\n- The environment was correctly configured with Node.js 20.x and all necessary dependencies, including `netcat` and `chalk`.\n- The test suite initially had failures due to missing `netcat` and ANSI color code issues, but these were resolved by installing `netcat` and forcing `chalk` to enable colors.\n- The project was successfully built and tested, confirming that the core functionality works as expected.\n- The test suite completed execution, and all tests passed, indicating that the environment is properly configured and the project is functional."
