"FAILED\n1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution) was not met: The test suite could not be executed because the PHPUnit binary was not available due to failed dependency installation. The Composer installation failed due to network/SSL issues, preventing the test framework from being installed.\n2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification) was not met: We couldn't verify core functionality because the project dependencies weren't installed. Without the dependencies, we couldn't import or test any core modules.\n3. The agent made significant progress in setting up the environment (installing PHP, extensions, and Composer), but the critical step of dependency installation failed due to external network issues beyond the agent's control.\n4. While the agent followed the correct procedure based on the CI configuration, the environment configuration cannot be considered successful as neither test execution nor core functionality verification was achieved."
