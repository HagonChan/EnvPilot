"PASSED\n1. Test Suite Execution: The test suite was successfully executed, with the majority of tests passing. The testing framework generated a complete test report structure, and while there were some test failures (like in `advanced.pidigits`), the suite completed successfully. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n\n2. Core Functionality Verification: The main functional modules were imported and used normally. Basic API calls returned expected results, and core features were demonstrated through example code execution. The project was successfully installed from source, and the test suite ran to completion, verifying core functionality. This meets Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe environment configuration was successful despite some test failures (which are acceptable as per the criteria) and the need to update deprecated imports to make the code compatible with Python 3.10. The agent successfully resolved these issues by modifying the necessary files to use modern Python imports from `collections.abc`. The remaining failure in `advanced.pidigits` is due to a deprecated function call (`time.clock()`) and does not affect the overall success of the environment configuration."
