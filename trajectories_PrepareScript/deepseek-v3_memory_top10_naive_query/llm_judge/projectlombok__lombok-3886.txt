"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed the test suite for the project. The tests for `javacCurrent`, `javac6`, and `javac8` goals all completed without errors, generating a complete test report structure. This meets the first success criterion.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent built the project successfully (`ant -noinput dist`) and verified core functionality by running the test suite. The main functional modules were imported and used normally, and the tests demonstrated that basic API calls return expected results. This meets the second success criterion.\n\nThe agent encountered initial issues with dependency downloads and a compilation error but resolved them by retrying the build and modifying the code to use a compatible method from the available `lombok.patcher` version. Despite these challenges, the final outcome was successful as both criteria were met."
