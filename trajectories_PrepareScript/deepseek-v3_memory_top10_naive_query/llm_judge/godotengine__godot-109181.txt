All 1239 test cases passed with no failures or errors, and the test framework generated a complete test report structure.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main executable (`godot.linuxbsd.editor.x86_64`) was built and ran successfully, demonstrating that the core functionality of the project is operational. The executable also supports additional features like the editor and project manager, as confirmed by the `--help` output.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria, as the test suite completed successfully and the core functionality was verified."
