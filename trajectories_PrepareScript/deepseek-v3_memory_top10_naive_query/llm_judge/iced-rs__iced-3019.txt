"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite successfully executed with `cargo test --workspace --all-features`, completing all 92 tests without failures. The test framework generated a complete report structure, confirming that the test suite ran to completion.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The successful compilation and execution of the test suite indicate that the core modules can be imported and used normally. The test results show that basic API calls and core features are functioning as expected.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria:\n- The test suite completed execution (Condition 1)\n- Core functionality was verified through successful test execution (Condition 2)\n\nThe agent successfully resolved all dependency issues (Rust toolchains, system libraries, build tools) to achieve a fully functional test environment."
