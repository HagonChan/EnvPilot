"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully with all tests passing. The output shows that 4870 tests were run, and they all completed without errors. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality was verified through the successful build and execution of the project. The CMake configuration completed without errors, and the build process using `make` was successful. Additionally, the test cases covered various modules and functionalities, confirming that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally. The example code executions and API calls returned expected results, as evidenced by the successful test outcomes.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful as both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) are met. The project is correctly configured, built, and tested."
