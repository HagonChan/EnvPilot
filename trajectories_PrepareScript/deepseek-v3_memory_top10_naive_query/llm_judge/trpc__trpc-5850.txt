"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed, as evidenced by the test runner completing and generating a report. Although some individual tests failed (e.g., `issue-3455-56-invalidate-queries.test.tsx`), the suite as a whole completed, which meets the success criteria. The failures appear to be test-specific timing issues rather than framework or environment problems.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality was verified through the successful execution of the majority of tests (678 passed out of 682). The project's main modules (e.g., `@trpc/server`, `@trpc/client`) were imported and used normally, and the test framework (Vitest) generated a complete report structure. The failures were isolated to specific test cases and did not indicate fundamental issues with the environment or core functionality.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful because both conditions (test suite completion and core functionality verification) were met, despite the non-critical test failures."
