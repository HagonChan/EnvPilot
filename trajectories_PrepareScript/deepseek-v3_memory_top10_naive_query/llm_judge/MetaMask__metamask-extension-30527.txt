"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed multiple test suites (unit, webpack, and integration tests) with Jest as the test framework. All test suites completed successfully, generating test reports. While there was one test failure in the unit tests (due to an environment-specific path mismatch), this is non-critical as the test suite completed execution and the majority of tests passed.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent demonstrated that core modules could be imported and used by successfully running the test suites. The project's main functional modules were verified through the execution of extensive test cases covering various aspects of the application. The test results show that the core functionality is operational, with only minor non-critical issues.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria:\n- At least one complete test suite executed successfully (in fact, all three did)\n- Core functionality was verified through test execution and module imports\n- The agent completed the task within the allowed call limit\n- No critical errors prevented test execution or core functionality verification"
