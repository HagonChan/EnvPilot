"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite for the `ext/standard` directory was successfully executed, with 3201 tests passing and 482 skipped (due to missing extensions). The test framework generated a complete test report structure, confirming that the test suite completed successfully. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The PHP build process completed successfully, and the core extensions were verified to be functional through the test execution. The ability to run the test suite and the successful execution of numerous test cases demonstrate that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally. This meets Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful as both conditions are satisfied. The skipped tests are non-critical as they are due to missing optional extensions, which do not affect the core functionality. The build and test processes confirm that the environment is correctly configured and operational."
