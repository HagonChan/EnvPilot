"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully with all tests passing (`test result: ok. 127 passed; 0 failed` for unit tests and `test result: ok. 44 passed; 0 failed` for integration tests). The testing framework generated a complete test report structure, including doc-tests, which also passed.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project built successfully (`Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s)`), and the tests verified that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally. The core features were demonstrated through the execution of example code in the tests.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria:\n- At least one complete test suite executed and finished successfully.\n- Core functionality was verified through test execution and successful builds."
