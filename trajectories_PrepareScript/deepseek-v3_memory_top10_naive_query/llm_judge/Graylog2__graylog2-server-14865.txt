"FAILED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent was unable to successfully execute any complete test suite. While the `graylog-plugin-archetype` module was built successfully, no test suite was executed to completion. The build process for other modules failed due to missing dependencies (specifically `graylog2-server`), preventing the execution of any test suites.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent did not verify the core functionality of the repository. Although the environment was correctly configured with Java 17 and Maven, the build process did not reach a point where core modules could be imported and used normally. The failure to resolve dependencies for critical modules like `graylog2-server` prevented any meaningful verification of core functionality.\n\nThe environment configuration did not meet the success criteria because:\n- No test suite completed execution\n- Core functionality could not be verified due to unresolved dependencies\n- The build process failed for most modules, indicating the environment was not fully functional for the repository's requirements"
