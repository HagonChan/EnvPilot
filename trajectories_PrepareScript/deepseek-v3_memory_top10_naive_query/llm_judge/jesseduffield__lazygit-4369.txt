"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully ran the test suite using `go test ./... -short -cover`, which completed without errors. The output shows test results and coverage percentages for various packages, indicating the test framework executed normally and generated a complete test report structure. While some packages show 0% coverage or have no test files, this doesn't constitute a framework-level failure as per the success criteria.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent properly set up the environment by:\n   - Installing the correct Go version (1.22.0)\n   - Installing all required system dependencies\n   - Downloading project dependencies via `go mod download`\n   The successful test execution implies core functionality is working since the tests wouldn't run if fundamental imports were broken.\n\nThe agent met both success criteria by ensuring the test suite could execute to completion and that the core functionality was operational, despite some individual test packages showing low coverage. The environment configuration is correct and functional."
