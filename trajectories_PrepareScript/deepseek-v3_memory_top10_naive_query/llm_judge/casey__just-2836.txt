"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite completed successfully with all 924 tests passing. The testing framework generated a complete test report structure, and the suite executed to completion without any framework-level failures.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules can be imported and used normally, as demonstrated by the successful execution of the test suite. Core features were verified through the test cases, and basic API calls returned expected results.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria:\n- The test suite executed completely (Condition 1)\n- Core functionality was verified (Condition 2)\n\nWhile there were initial test failures due to missing dependencies (python3) and environment variables (USER), these were resolved during the configuration process. The final test run confirmed all functionality is working as expected."
