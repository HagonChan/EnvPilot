"PASSED\n1. Test Suite Execution: The test suite executed successfully as evidenced by the output of `make test`. Multiple test packages were run, and all tests passed with coverage reports generated for each package. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n2. Core Functionality Verification: The environment was properly configured with Go 1.21, all dependencies were successfully downloaded, and the build system (make) worked correctly. The ability to run the test suite and get meaningful output demonstrates that core functionality is working. This meets Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe agent successfully installed all required dependencies (Go 1.21, wget, make), configured the environment correctly, and executed the test suite without any critical failures. While some packages showed low test coverage, this doesn't affect the success criteria as the test framework completed execution and core functionality was verified."
