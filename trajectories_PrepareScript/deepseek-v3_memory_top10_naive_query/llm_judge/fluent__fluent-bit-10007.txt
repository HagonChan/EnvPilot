"FAILED\nDetailed Reasoning:\n\n1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**:\n   - The agent attempted to run tests but encountered multiple issues:\n     - The `run-unit-tests.sh` script specified in the CI configuration was not found in the repository.\n     - The `ctest` command reported \"No test configuration file found\", indicating tests were not properly built or configured.\n     - No test binaries were found in expected locations (`bin` directory or elsewhere).\n   - While the project was successfully built, no test suite could be executed to completion, failing Condition 1.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**:\n   - The agent successfully:\n     - Installed all required dependencies\n     - Configured the project with CMake\n     - Built the project from source\n   - However, there was no explicit verification of core functionality through:\n     - Importing/using main functional modules\n     - Making basic API calls\n     - Executing example code\n   - The build process completed but core functionality wasn't demonstrated, failing Condition 2.\n\n3. Additional Observations:\n   - The environment configuration was mostly successful (dependencies installed, project built)\n   - Test infrastructure appears incomplete/misconfigured in the repository\n   - The agent made reasonable attempts to locate and execute tests but couldn't overcome the missing test configuration\n   - Both success criteria must be met, and neither was fully satisfied in this case"
