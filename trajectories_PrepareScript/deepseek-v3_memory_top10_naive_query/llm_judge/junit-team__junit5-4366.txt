"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The Gradle build successfully executed multiple test suites (platform-tests, jupiter-tests, platform-tooling-support-tests) with all tests passing. The output shows test reports being generated (\"generateOpenTestHtmlReport\") and the build completing successfully with \"BUILD SUCCESSFUL\".\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The environment was properly configured with Java 21 and Graphviz, and the Gradle wrapper successfully built the project. The successful test execution demonstrates that core modules can be imported and used, as the tests wouldn't pass if fundamental functionality was broken.\n\nThe initial build failure due to a transient network issue (Eclipse JDT formatter timeout) was resolved in the subsequent attempt, and the final build shows all critical test suites completing successfully with no fundamental errors. The agent successfully configured the environment and verified both test execution and core functionality."
