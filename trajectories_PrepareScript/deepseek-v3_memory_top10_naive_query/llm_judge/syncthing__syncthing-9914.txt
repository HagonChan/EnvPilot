"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed using the command `go run build.go test`. The output shows multiple test packages running and completing successfully (e.g., `ok github.com/syncthing/syncthing/lib/api 17.6s`). The test framework generated a complete test report structure, and all test cases passed.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality was verified by successfully installing the project dependencies (`go get ./...`) and running the tests. The main functional modules were imported and used normally, as evidenced by the successful test execution across multiple packages. Basic API calls and core features were demonstrated through the test execution.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria: the test suite completed successfully, and the core functionality was verified. Individual test failures were not observed, and the agent did not exceed the maximum call limit. The environment is correctly configured for the repository."
