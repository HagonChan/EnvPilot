"FAILED\n1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**: The test suite did not complete successfully. Attempts to run tests directly with `go test -race ./...` resulted in build failures across multiple packages, indicating the environment was not properly configured to execute the tests. The error messages suggest fundamental issues with the Go toolchain setup, including version mismatches and cgo configuration problems.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**: Core functionality could not be verified as the build process failed before any meaningful execution could occur. The inability to even compile the code suggests the environment is not correctly configured for basic operations.\n\nThe environment configuration failed due to:\n- Unresolved Go version conflicts (invalid version 1.23.0 specified in go.mod)\n- Build toolchain issues preventing successful compilation\n- Docker dependency for test execution that couldn't be satisfied\n- Multiple attempts to configure the environment properly were unsuccessful\n\nThe agent made reasonable attempts to configure the environment but was ultimately unable to satisfy both success criteria due to fundamental configuration issues in the repository setup."
