"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The Go tests were successfully executed using `go test ./...`, and all test suites completed without build failures. The output shows that multiple test packages (e.g., `gorm.io/gorm`, `gorm.io/gorm/callbacks`, `gorm.io/gorm/clause`) passed with execution times reported. This meets the success criterion of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully, even though Docker-dependent tests were skipped due to environmental constraints.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The successful execution of the Go tests implies that the core functionality of the repository is operational. The tests cover various modules (e.g., callbacks, schema, utils), and their passing indicates that these modules can be imported and used normally. Additionally, the agent verified the Go version and dependencies, ensuring the environment was correctly configured for the project.\n\nThe Docker-related issues were environmental limitations and did not prevent the core Go tests from running successfully. The agent addressed all resolvable issues (Go version conflicts, missing packages) and achieved the primary goals of environment configuration."
