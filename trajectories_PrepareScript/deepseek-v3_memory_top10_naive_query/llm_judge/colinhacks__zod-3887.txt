"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The Node.js test suite (`yarn test`) executed successfully, with all 57 test suites passing and 488 tests completed. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully, even though the Deno tests could not be run due to network issues.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The build process (`yarn build`) completed without errors, and the main functional modules were verified through the successful execution of the test suite. Core functionality was demonstrated by the passing tests, which cover various aspects of the project's features.\n\nThe Deno tests were not executed due to network issues during installation, but this does not affect the overall success since the Node.js tests already satisfy the criteria. The environment configuration is considered successful as both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) are met."
