"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed the test suite using `npm test`, which ran 679 test cases with all passing. The test framework (mocha) generated a complete test report structure, meeting the first success criterion.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent verified core functionality by successfully installing dependencies (`npm ci`) and running the main test suite. The project's main modules were imported and used normally during the test execution, as evidenced by the successful test results.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria:\n- At least one complete test suite executed successfully (679 passing tests)\n- Core functionality was verified through test execution and dependency installation\n- No critical errors occurred during the process (import failures or test framework issues)"
