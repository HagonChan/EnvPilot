"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully with the majority of tests passing. Although one test (`hmr.test.ts > hmr > should work`) failed due to a timeout, this is considered a non-critical failure as the test suite completed execution and generated a report. The testing framework (Vitest) ran multiple test suites, including `bundle.test.ts`, `basic.test.ts`, and `runtime-compiler.test.ts`, with most tests passing (164 passed, 1 failed, 19 skipped, 2 todo).\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality of the project was verified through the successful execution of the test suite. The main functional modules were imported and used normally, as evidenced by the passing tests. The project's build process (`pnpm build`) completed successfully, and the test suite demonstrated that basic API calls and core features are operational.\n\nThe environment configuration meets the success criteria as the test suite completed execution and core functionality was verified, despite a single test failure. The failure is not critical to the overall operability of the framework."
