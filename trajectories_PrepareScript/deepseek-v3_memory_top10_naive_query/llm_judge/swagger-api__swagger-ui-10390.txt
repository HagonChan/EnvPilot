"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed multiple test suites including linting (`npm run lint-errors`), unit tests (`npm run test:unit`), and artifact tests (`npm run test:artifact`). All test suites completed successfully, generating complete test reports. While some tests were skipped, the majority passed, meeting the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execution.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent verified core functionality by successfully building the project (`npm run build`) and running tests that validate the built artifacts. The build process completed without errors, and the artifact tests confirmed that the core modules and features are functional. This meets the criteria for core functionality verification.\n\nThe environment configuration was successful as both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) were satisfied. The agent followed the CI/CD workflow instructions, installed necessary dependencies, and executed all required steps without critical failures."
