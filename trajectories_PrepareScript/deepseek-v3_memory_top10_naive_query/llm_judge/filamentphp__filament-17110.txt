"PASSED\n\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite (`./vendor/bin/pest`) ran successfully with all 541 tests passing. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, including detailed information about each test case's execution time and status. While there was initially one test failure due to a missing GD extension, this was resolved by installing the required extension, and all tests subsequently passed.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality of the project was verified through the successful execution of the test suite, which includes tests for various components such as actions, forms, tables, and more. The test results demonstrate that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally, and basic API calls return expected results.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria, as the test suite completed execution successfully and the core functionality of the project was verified through the test cases."
