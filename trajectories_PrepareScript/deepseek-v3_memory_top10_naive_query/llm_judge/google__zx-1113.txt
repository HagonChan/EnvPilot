"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite ran successfully, completing execution with a full test report structure. Out of 205 tests, 202 passed, 2 failed, and 1 was skipped. The test framework (Jest) executed all tests and generated detailed output, including failure details.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules were successfully imported and used during the test execution. The build process completed without errors, and core features were demonstrated through the test cases. The two test failures appear to be specific assertion issues rather than fundamental functionality problems.\n\nThe environment meets both success criteria:\n- The test suite completed execution (despite some individual test failures)\n- Core functionality was verified through the test execution process"
