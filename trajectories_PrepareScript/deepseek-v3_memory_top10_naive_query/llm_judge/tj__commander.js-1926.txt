"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully with all 99 test suites passing and 1073 tests completed. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, including coverage statistics, confirming that the test suite ran to completion without critical failures.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules were successfully imported and used, as evidenced by the successful execution of the test suite. The core features were demonstrated through the test execution, and the TypeScript type checking (`test-typings`) also passed without errors, indicating that the core functionality is intact.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria, as the test suite completed successfully and the core functionality was verified. The agent successfully installed the correct Node.js version, installed dependencies, and executed the tests without encountering any critical errors."
