"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite successfully executed with `tox -e py311`, completing with 482 passed tests and 2 skipped tests. The testing framework generated a complete test report structure, meeting Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality was verified implicitly by the successful execution of the test suite, which includes tests for basic URL generation, request context handling, and other core features. Additionally, the agent demonstrated the ability to import and use core modules (e.g., `werkzeug`, `click`) by resolving version conflicts and ensuring compatibility.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful because:\n- The test suite completed execution without framework-level failures (individual test failures were resolved by ensuring correct dependency versions).\n- Core modules were imported and used correctly after resolving version conflicts (e.g., `werkzeug>=2.2.2`, `click==8.0.0`).\n- The agent followed a systematic approach to diagnose and fix issues, ensuring the environment met the project's requirements."
