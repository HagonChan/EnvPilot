"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed the Jest test suites, with all 8 test suites passing. The test framework generated a complete test report showing 1204 passed tests and 121 passed snapshots. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent verified core functionality by successfully installing all dependencies using Yarn and running the test scripts. The project's main modules were imported and used normally during the test execution, as evidenced by the successful test results. The core features were demonstrated through the test execution.\n\nThe agent successfully configured the environment, installed dependencies, and executed the test cases, meeting both success criteria. The environment is now properly set up for further development or testing."
