"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite `./flattests` executed successfully and completed with the output \"ALL TESTS PASSED\". This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project was successfully built using `cmake` and `make`, and the main functional modules were verified by running the test executable. The core functionality is confirmed to be working as expected.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful as both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) are satisfied. The agent successfully installed the required dependencies, configured the build environment, and executed the tests without any critical failures."
