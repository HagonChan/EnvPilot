Core Functionality Verification: The successful execution of the test suite implies the core functionality is working. The build process completed without errors, and the test results show the main functional modules are operational. This meets Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful as both required conditions are satisfied: the test suite completed execution and core functionality is verified through the test results."
