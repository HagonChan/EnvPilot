"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed both C++ and Java test suites. The C++ tests (`generate_geocoding_data_test` and `libphonenumber_test`) ran without errors, producing a complete test report with all tests passing. The Java tests were executed via Maven (`mvn test -P github-actions`) and also completed successfully, as indicated by the \"BUILD SUCCESS\" message and the absence of test failures.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent verified core functionality by:\n   - Building the C++ project successfully using CMake and Make, confirming the build system works.\n   - Running the C++ tests, which exercise core functionality (e.g., phone number parsing/formatting in `libphonenumber_test`).\n   - Building and testing the Java components via Maven, including the main library and demo applications.\n   - The Maven build process included compilation of all Java modules and execution of tests, demonstrating core functionality is operational.\n\nBoth success criteria are fully met - test suites completed execution and core functionality was verified through successful builds and test executions. The agent properly configured the environment (installing dependencies, setting up JDK 8, etc.) to achieve this result."
