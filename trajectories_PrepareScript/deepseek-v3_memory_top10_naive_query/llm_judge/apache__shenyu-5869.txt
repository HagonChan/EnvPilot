"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The Maven build process successfully executed multiple test suites across different modules. While there were some test failures in the `shenyu-admin` module, the test framework generated complete test reports (as seen in the `surefire-reports` directory), indicating that the test suite completed execution. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The build process successfully compiled and executed tests for multiple core modules (e.g., `shenyu-common`, `shenyu-plugin`). The presence of test reports and the fact that many modules were built successfully demonstrate that core functionality can be imported and used normally. This meets Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nNote: While there were test failures, the success criteria explicitly state that individual test case failures are acceptable as long as the suite completes and core functionality works, which is the case here. The environment was properly configured with Java 17 and Maven, and the build system executed as expected."
