"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite completed successfully with 1833 tests passed, 80 skipped, and 6 expected failures. The testing framework generated a complete test report structure, meeting the success criteria for test execution.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project was successfully installed from source, and the core modules were imported and used normally during the test execution. The test results demonstrate that the main functional modules are operational.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful because:\n- The test suite executed to completion with a valid test report structure\n- Core functionality was verified through the passing tests\n- The agent resolved dependency conflicts by downgrading numpy, matplotlib, and pandas to compatible versions\n- All required system dependencies (Python, pip, pandoc) were properly installed\n\nNote: While there are some test failures (xfailed) and warnings, these are expected and documented behaviors that don't prevent the environment from being considered successfully configured according to the given criteria."
