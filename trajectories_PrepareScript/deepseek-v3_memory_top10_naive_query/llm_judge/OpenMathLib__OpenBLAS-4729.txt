"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The build process completed successfully, and the tests passed without errors. The output shows that multiple test suites (e.g., `cblas_cgemm3m`, `cblas_zgemm3m`) were executed and passed the computational tests. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, confirming that the test suite executed and finished successfully.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The library (`libopenblas_skylakexp-r0.3.27.dev.a`) was built and installed successfully. The core functionality was verified by the successful execution of the test suites and the correct installation of the library files (`libopenblas.a`, `libopenblas.so`) in `/usr/local/lib`. The installation includes all necessary header files and configuration files, confirming that the core modules can be imported and used normally.\n\nBoth success criteria are met: the test suite executed successfully, and the core functionality was verified."
