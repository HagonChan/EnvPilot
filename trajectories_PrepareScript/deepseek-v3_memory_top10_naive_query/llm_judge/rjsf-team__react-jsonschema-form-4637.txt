"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite (`npm test`) was successfully executed after building the project (`npm run build-serial`). Although some tests were flaky, the test framework completed execution and generated results for all projects. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project was successfully built, and dependencies were installed without critical errors. The ability to run the test suite indicates that core modules can be imported and used normally, meeting Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful as both conditions are satisfied: the test suite completed execution, and core functionality was verified. The flaky tests and deprecation warnings do not affect the overall success as they are non-critical issues."
