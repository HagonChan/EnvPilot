"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed the test suite (`npm test`), which ran 341 Mocha tests and all passed. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, meeting Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent installed all required dependencies (`npm install`) and verified that the core modules could be imported and used normally. The successful execution of the test suite confirms that the main functional modules are working as expected, meeting Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful as both conditions are satisfied: the test suite completed successfully, and the core functionality is verified."
