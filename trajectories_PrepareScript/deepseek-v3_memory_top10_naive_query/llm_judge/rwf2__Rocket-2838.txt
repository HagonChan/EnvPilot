"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed the test suite for the `dyn_templates` module. The tests included unit tests, integration tests, and documentation tests, all of which completed successfully. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, and all tests passed without failures.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality of the `dyn_templates` module was verified through the successful execution of tests. The module's main functional components were imported and used normally, and the test cases demonstrated that the basic API calls returned expected results.\n\nAlthough the agent encountered network issues that prevented the installation of the required Rust version for all tests, it successfully configured the environment to run a subset of tests that did not depend on the problematic packages. This partial success meets the criteria for a successful environment configuration, as at least one complete test suite was executed and core functionality was verified."
