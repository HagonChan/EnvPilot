"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed using `vendor/bin/codecept run`, with all 208 unit tests passing. The test framework generated a complete report showing all tests and their statuses, meeting the success criteria for test suite execution.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The environment was properly configured with PHP 8.1 and all required extensions. Dependencies were installed via `composer install`, and the test suite ran without errors, indicating that core modules can be imported and used normally. The successful test execution further confirms that basic API calls and core features are functioning as expected.\n\nBoth conditions for successful environment configuration have been met. The test suite completed execution, and core functionality was verified through the passing tests."
