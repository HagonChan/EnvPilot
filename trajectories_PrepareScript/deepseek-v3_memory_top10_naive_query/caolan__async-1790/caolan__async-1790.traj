Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '>=12.x'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: npm ci\n  name: npm\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- mocha\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The node command was not found when checking the Node.js version\n    - Solution: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running JavaScript-based projects. The root cause was a missing Node.js installation in the environment. The solution was to install Node.js using the NodeSource script to configure the repository and then install it via the system package manager.\n    - Action: curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The Node.js runtime was missing, which is required for building and running the Express.js project. The root cause was the absence of the Node.js package in the environment configuration.

The solution is to review common documentation patterns and use more flexible search terms like 'build', 'install', or 'test' to locate relevant instructions.\n    - Action: search_file 'build' OR search_file 'install' OR search_file 'test'\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: npm was not available after Node.js installation, causing dependency installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was npm not being installed or accessible in the path, despite Node.js being present, likely due to incomplete Node.js package setup or path issues. The solution was to install yarn globally using npm (which became available after Node.js installation) and then use yarn to install project dependencies, bypassing npm issues.\n    - Action: npm install -g yarn && yarn install\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '>=12.x'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: npm ci\n  name: npm\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- mocha\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The node command was not found when checking the Node.js version\n    - Solution: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running JavaScript-based projects. The root cause was a missing Node.js installation in the environment. The solution was to install Node.js using the NodeSource script to configure the repository and then install it via the system package manager.\n    - Action: curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The Node.js runtime was missing, which is required for building and running the Express.js project. The root cause was the absence of the Node.js package in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after resolving a dpkg state issue.\n    - Action: apt update && apt install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial search for build instructions in README.md failed due to incorrect section header pattern\n    - Solution: The root cause was using an incorrect search pattern ('## Building') that didn't match the actual structure of the README. The solution is to review common documentation patterns and use more flexible search terms like 'build', 'install', or 'test' to locate relevant instructions.\n    - Action: search_file 'build' OR search_file 'install' OR search_file 'test'\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: npm was not available after Node.js installation, causing dependency installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was npm not being installed or accessible in the path, despite Node.js being present, likely due to incomplete Node.js package setup or path issues. The solution was to install yarn globally using npm (which became available after Node.js installation) and then use yarn to install project dependencies, bypassing npm issues.\n    - Action: npm install -g yarn && yarn install\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1.

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '>=12.x'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: npm ci\n  name: npm\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- mocha\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The node command was not found when checking the Node.js version\n    - Solution: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running JavaScript-based projects. The root cause was a missing Node.js installation in the environment. The solution was to install Node.js using the NodeSource script to configure the repository and then install it via the system package manager.\n    - Action: curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The Node.js runtime was missing, which is required for building and running the Express.js project. The root cause was the absence of the Node.js package in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after resolving a dpkg state issue.\n    - Action: apt update && apt install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial search for build instructions in README.md failed due to incorrect section header pattern\n    - Solution: The root cause was using an incorrect search pattern ('## Building') that didn't match the actual structure of the README. The solution is to review common documentation patterns and use more flexible search terms like 'build', 'install', or 'test' to locate relevant instructions.\n    - Action: search_file 'build' OR search_file 'install' OR search_file 'test'\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: npm was not available after Node.js installation, causing dependency installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was npm not being installed or accessible in the path, despite Node.js being present, likely due to incomplete Node.js package setup or path issues. The solution was to install yarn globally using npm (which became available after Node.js installation) and then use yarn to install project dependencies, bypassing npm issues.\n    - Action: npm install -g yarn && yarn install\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '>=12.x'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: npm ci\n  name: npm\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- mocha\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The node command was not found when checking the Node.js version\n    - Solution: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running JavaScript-based projects. The root cause was a missing Node.js installation in the environment. The solution was to install Node.js using the NodeSource script to configure the repository and then install it via the system package manager.\n    - Action: curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The Node.js runtime was missing, which is required for building and running the Express.js project. The root cause was the absence of the Node.js package in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after resolving a dpkg state issue.\n    - Action: apt update && apt install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial search for build instructions in README.md failed due to incorrect section header pattern\n    - Solution: The root cause was using an incorrect search pattern ('## Building') that didn't match the actual structure of the README. The solution is to review common documentation patterns and use more flexible search terms like 'build', 'install', or 'test' to locate relevant instructions.\n    - Action: search_file 'build' OR search_file 'install' OR search_file 'test'\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: npm was not available after Node.js installation, causing dependency installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was npm not being installed or accessible in the path, despite Node.js being present, likely due to incomplete Node.js package setup or path issues. The solution was to install yarn globally using npm (which became available after Node.js installation) and then use yarn to install project dependencies, bypassing npm issues.\n    - Action: npm install -g yarn && yarn install\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '>=12.x'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: npm ci\n  name: npm\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- mocha\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The node command was not found when checking the Node.js version\n    - Solution: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running JavaScript-based projects. The root cause was a missing Node.js installation in the environment. The solution was to install Node.js using the NodeSource script to configure the repository and then install it via the system package manager.\n    - Action: curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The Node.js runtime was missing, which is required for building and running the Express.js project. The root cause was the absence of the Node.js package in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after resolving a dpkg state issue.\n    - Action: apt update && apt install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial search for build instructions in README.md failed due to incorrect section header pattern\n    - Solution: The root cause was using an incorrect search pattern ('## Building') that didn't match the actual structure of the README. The solution is to review common documentation patterns and use more flexible search terms like 'build', 'install', or 'test' to locate relevant instructions.\n    - Action: search_file 'build' OR search_file 'install' OR search_file 'test'\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: npm was not available after Node.js installation, causing dependency installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was npm not being installed or accessible in the path, despite Node.js being present, likely due to incomplete Node.js package setup or path issues. The solution was to install yarn globally using npm (which became available after Node.js installation) and then use yarn to install project dependencies, bypassing npm issues.\n    - Action: npm install -g yarn && yarn install\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '>=12.x'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: npm ci\n  name: npm\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- mocha\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The node command was not found when checking the Node.js version\n    - Solution: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running JavaScript-based projects. The root cause was a missing Node.js installation in the environment. The solution was to install Node.js using the NodeSource script to configure the repository and then install it via the system package manager.\n    - Action: curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The Node.js runtime was missing, which is required for building and running the Express.js project. The root cause was the absence of the Node.js package in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after resolving a dpkg state issue.\n    - Action: apt update && apt install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial search for build instructions in README.md failed due to incorrect section header pattern\n    - Solution: The root cause was using an incorrect search pattern ('## Building') that didn't match the actual structure of the README. The solution is to review common documentation patterns and use more flexible search terms like 'build', 'install', or 'test' to locate relevant instructions.\n    - Action: search_file 'build' OR search_file 'install' OR search_file 'test'\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: npm was not available after Node.js installation, causing dependency installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was npm not being installed or accessible in the path, despite Node.js being present, likely due to incomplete Node.js package setup or path issues. The solution was to install yarn globally using npm (which became available after Node.js installation) and then use yarn to install project dependencies, bypassing npm issues.\n    - Action: npm install -g yarn && yarn install\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '>=12.x'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: npm ci\n  name: npm\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- mocha\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The node command was not found when checking the Node.js version\n    - Solution: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running JavaScript-based projects. The root cause was a missing Node.js installation in the environment. The solution was to install Node.js using the NodeSource script to configure the repository and then install it via the system package manager.\n    - Action: curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The Node.js runtime was missing, which is required for building and running the Express.js project. The root cause was the absence of the Node.js package in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after resolving a dpkg state issue.\n    - Action: apt update && apt install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial search for build instructions in README.md failed due to incorrect section header pattern\n    - Solution: The root cause was using an incorrect search pattern ('## Building') that didn't match the actual structure of the README. The solution is to review common documentation patterns and use more flexible search terms like 'build', 'install', or 'test' to locate relevant instructions.\n    - Action: search_file 'build' OR search_file 'install' OR search_file 'test'\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: npm was not available after Node.js installation, causing dependency installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was npm not being installed or accessible in the path, despite Node.js being present, likely due to incomplete Node.js package setup or path issues. The solution was to install yarn globally using npm (which became available after Node.js installation) and then use yarn to install project dependencies, bypassing npm issues.\n    - Action: npm install -g yarn && yarn install\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '>=12.x'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: npm ci\n  name: npm\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- mocha\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The node command was not found when checking the Node.js version\n    - Solution: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running JavaScript-based projects. The root cause was a missing Node.js installation in the environment. The solution was to install Node.js using the NodeSource script to configure the repository and then install it via the system package manager.\n    - Action: curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The Node.js runtime was missing, which is required for building and running the Express.js project. The root cause was the absence of the Node.js package in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after resolving a dpkg state issue.\n    - Action: apt update && apt install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial search for build instructions in README.md failed due to incorrect section header pattern\n    - Solution: The root cause was using an incorrect search pattern ('## Building') that didn't match the actual structure of the README. The solution is to review common documentation patterns and use more flexible search terms like 'build', 'install', or 'test' to locate relevant instructions.\n    - Action: search_file 'build' OR search_file 'install' OR search_file 'test'\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: npm was not available after Node.js installation, causing dependency installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was npm not being installed or accessible in the path, despite Node.js being present, likely due to incomplete Node.js package setup or path issues. The solution was to install yarn globally using npm (which became available after Node.js installation) and then use yarn to install project dependencies, bypassing npm issues.\n    - Action: npm install -g yarn && yarn install\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '>=12.x'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: npm ci\n  name: npm\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- mocha\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The node command was not found when checking the Node.js version\n    - Solution: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running JavaScript-based projects. The root cause was a missing Node.js installation in the environment. The solution was to install Node.js using the NodeSource script to configure the repository and then install it via the system package manager.\n    - Action: curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The Node.js runtime was missing, which is required for building and running the Express.js project. The root cause was the absence of the Node.js package in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after resolving a dpkg state issue.\n    - Action: apt update && apt install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial search for build instructions in README.md failed due to incorrect section header pattern\n    - Solution: The root cause was using an incorrect search pattern ('## Building') that didn't match the actual structure of the README. The solution is to review common documentation patterns and use more flexible search terms like 'build', 'install', or 'test' to locate relevant instructions.\n    - Action: search_file 'build' OR search_file 'install' OR search_file 'test'\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: npm was not available after Node.js installation, causing dependency installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was npm not being installed or accessible in the path, despite Node.js being present, likely due to incomplete Node.js package setup or path issues. The solution was to install yarn globally using npm (which became available after Node.js installation) and then use yarn to install project dependencies, bypassing npm issues.\n    - Action: npm install -g yarn && yarn install\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '>=12.x'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: npm ci\n  name: npm\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- mocha\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The node command was not found when checking the Node.js version\n    - Solution: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running JavaScript-based projects. The root cause was a missing Node.js installation in the environment. The solution was to install Node.js using the NodeSource script to configure the repository and then install it via the system package manager.\n    - Action: curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The Node.js runtime was missing, which is required for building and running the Express.js project. The root cause was the absence of the Node.js package in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after resolving a dpkg state issue.\n    - Action: apt update && apt install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial search for build instructions in README.md failed due to incorrect section header pattern\n    - Solution: The root cause was using an incorrect search pattern ('## Building') that didn't match the actual structure of the README. The solution is to review common documentation patterns and use more flexible search terms like 'build', 'install', or 'test' to locate relevant instructions.\n    - Action: search_file 'build' OR search_file 'install' OR search_file 'test'\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: npm was not available after Node.js installation, causing dependency installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was npm not being installed or accessible in the path, despite Node.js being present, likely due to incomplete Node.js package setup or path issues. The solution was to install yarn globally using npm (which became available after Node.js installation) and then use yarn to install project dependencies, bypassing npm issues.\n    - Action: npm install -g yarn && yarn install\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '>=12.x'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: npm ci\n  name: npm\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- mocha\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The node command was not found when checking the Node.js version\n    - Solution: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running JavaScript-based projects. The root cause was a missing Node.js installation in the environment. The solution was to install Node.js using the NodeSource script to configure the repository and then install it via the system package manager.\n    - Action: curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The Node.js runtime was missing, which is required for building and running the Express.js project. The root cause was the absence of the Node.js package in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after resolving a dpkg state issue.\n    - Action: apt update && apt install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial search for build instructions in README.md failed due to incorrect section header pattern\n    - Solution: The root cause was using an incorrect search pattern ('## Building') that didn't match the actual structure of the README. The solution is to review common documentation patterns and use more flexible search terms like 'build', 'install', or 'test' to locate relevant instructions.\n    - Action: search_file 'build' OR search_file 'install' OR search_file 'test'\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: npm was not available after Node.js installation, causing dependency installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was npm not being installed or accessible in the path, despite Node.js being present, likely due to incomplete Node.js package setup or path issues. The solution was to install yarn globally using npm (which became available after Node.js installation) and then use yarn to install project dependencies, bypassing npm issues.\n    - Action: npm install -g yarn && yarn install\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Here's what I've gathered:\n\n1. **Node.js Versions**: The workflow tests the project against Node.js versions 12, 14, 16, and 17.\n2. **Dependency Installation**: The command `npm ci` is used to install dependencies.\n3. **Test Execution**: The command `npm test` runs the tests, and `npm run mocha-browser-test` runs browser-specific tests.\n4. **Linting**: The command `npm run lint` is used for linting.\n\nSince the project requires Node.js >=12.x, I'll proceed with the following steps:\n1. Install Node.js (version 14.x, as it's commonly used in the workflow).\n2. Install project dependencies using `npm ci`.\n3.

      "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '>=12.x'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: npm ci\n  name: npm\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- mocha\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The node command was not found when checking the Node.js version\n    - Solution: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running JavaScript-based projects. The root cause was a missing Node.js installation in the environment. The solution was to install Node.js using the NodeSource script to configure the repository and then install it via the system package manager.\n    - Action: curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The Node.js runtime was missing, which is required for building and running the Express.js project. The root cause was the absence of the Node.js package in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after resolving a dpkg state issue.\n    - Action: apt update && apt install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The initial search for build instructions in README.md failed due to incorrect section header pattern\n    - Solution: The root cause was using an incorrect search pattern ('## Building') that didn't match the actual structure of the README. The solution is to review common documentation patterns and use more flexible search terms like 'build', 'install', or 'test' to locate relevant instructions.\n    - Action: search_file 'build' OR search_file 'install' OR search_file 'test'\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: npm was not available after Node.js installation, causing dependency installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was npm not being installed or accessible in the path, despite Node.js being present, likely due to incomplete Node.js package setup or path issues. The solution was to install yarn globally using npm (which became available after Node.js installation) and then use yarn to install project dependencies, bypassing npm issues.\n    - Action: npm install -g yarn && yarn install\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: cross-env dependency not installed globally\n    - Solution: cross-env was required to run environment-dependent test scripts but was not available globally. The root cause was missing global npm dependencies in the environment. The solution was to install cross-env globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g cross-env\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\",\"instance_template\":\"We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\\n\\n{{repo_related_info}}\\n\\n{{cross_repo_knowledge}}\\n\\nTASK TIPS:\\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.\",\"next_step_template\":\"{{observation}}\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"next_step_no_output_template\":\"Your command ran successfully and did not produce any output.\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"strategy_template\":null,\"demonstration_template\":null,\"success_reflection_template\":\"You are an expert code assistant who just successfully repaired a software project in an automated programming session.
