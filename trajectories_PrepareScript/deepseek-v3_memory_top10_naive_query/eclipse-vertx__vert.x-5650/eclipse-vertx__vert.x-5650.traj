The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 using the system package manager, providing the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- Maven\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: 8, 11, 21\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: pom.xml\n  install_command: mvn package\n  name: Maven\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - JDK (Java Development Kit)\ntest_framework:\n- Maven (via mvn test)\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle test command failed due to missing Java Development Kit (JDK).\n    - Solution: The JDK was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for Java-based projects. The root cause was the absence of Java in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing the default JDK package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle build command failed due to the JAVA_HOME environment variable not being set and Java not being installed.\n    - Solution: Java was required for building the Gradle-based project but was missing from the Ubuntu environment. The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) installation. The solution involved installing the default JDK package using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed Java version is incompatible with the project's build tool.\n    - Solution: The Gradle wrapper version was outdated and incompatible with the newer Java version (e.g., Java 21), causing build failures. The root cause was a version mismatch between the Java runtime and the build tool. The solution was to install an older, compatible Java version (OpenJDK 11).\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The Java Development Kit (JDK) was not installed, causing the initial Maven build command to fail.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a JDK installation, which is required for compiling and running Java projects. The solution was to install OpenJDK 11 using the system package manager, ensuring the necessary Java runtime and development tools were available in the environment.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle build failed due to missing Java Development Kit (JDK) installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java runtime environment required for Gradle operations. The Dockerfile specified 'openjdk-11-jdk-headless' as a dependency, but it was not installed in the environment. The solution involved updating the package index and installing the required JDK package using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk-headless\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: A build tool requiring Java was missing from the environment.\n    - Solution: The ANTLR parser generation step failed because the Java executable was not found, indicating that the Java Development Kit (JDK) was not installed. The root cause was the absence of JDK in the environment configuration. The solution was to install the default JDK using the system package manager to enable tools like ANTLR to run.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was missing, causing test failures during project execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Maven package in the environment. Maven is required for running certain integration tests in the project, specifically for the jib-maven-plugin module. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the command not found errors and allowed tests to pass.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was not installed on the system, causing the 'mvn' command to be unavailable for building the Java project.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Maven in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the unavailability of the build tool.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The initial build command failed due to Java not being installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) in the environment, which is required for building and running Java-based projects. This prevented Maven commands from executing. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 11 using the system package manager to provide the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Java runtime not installed, causing Maven build failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) in the environment, which is required for compiling and running Java projects. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 using the system package manager, providing the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- Maven\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: 8, 11, 21\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: pom.xml\n  install_command: mvn package\n  name: Maven\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - JDK (Java Development Kit)\ntest_framework:\n- Maven (via mvn test)\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle test command failed due to missing Java Development Kit (JDK).\n    - Solution: The JDK was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for Java-based projects. The root cause was the absence of Java in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing the default JDK package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle build command failed due to the JAVA_HOME environment variable not being set and Java not being installed.\n    - Solution: Java was required for building the Gradle-based project but was missing from the Ubuntu environment. The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) installation. The solution involved installing the default JDK package using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed Java version is incompatible with the project's build tool.\n    - Solution: The Gradle wrapper version was outdated and incompatible with the newer Java version (e.g., Java 21), causing build failures. The root cause was a version mismatch between the Java runtime and the build tool. The solution was to install an older, compatible Java version (OpenJDK 11).\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The Java Development Kit (JDK) was not installed, causing the initial Maven build command to fail.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a JDK installation, which is required for compiling and running Java projects. The solution was to install OpenJDK 11 using the system package manager, ensuring the necessary Java runtime and development tools were available in the environment.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle build failed due to missing Java Development Kit (JDK) installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java runtime environment required for Gradle operations. The Dockerfile specified 'openjdk-11-jdk-headless' as a dependency, but it was not installed in the environment. The solution involved updating the package index and installing the required JDK package using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk-headless\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: A build tool requiring Java was missing from the environment.\n    - Solution: The ANTLR parser generation step failed because the Java executable was not found, indicating that the Java Development Kit (JDK) was not installed. The root cause was the absence of JDK in the environment configuration. The solution was to install the default JDK using the system package manager to enable tools like ANTLR to run.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was missing, causing test failures during project execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Maven package in the environment. Maven is required for running certain integration tests in the project, specifically for the jib-maven-plugin module. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the command not found errors and allowed tests to pass.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was not installed on the system, causing the 'mvn' command to be unavailable for building the Java project.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Maven in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the unavailability of the build tool.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The initial build command failed due to Java not being installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) in the environment, which is required for building and running Java-based projects. This prevented Maven commands from executing. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 11 using the system package manager to provide the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Java runtime not installed, causing Maven build failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) in the environment, which is required for compiling and running Java projects. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 using the system package manager, providing the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- Maven\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: 8, 11, 21\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: pom.xml\n  install_command: mvn package\n  name: Maven\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - JDK (Java Development Kit)\ntest_framework:\n- Maven (via mvn test)\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle test command failed due to missing Java Development Kit (JDK).\n    - Solution: The JDK was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for Java-based projects. The root cause was the absence of Java in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing the default JDK package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle build command failed due to the JAVA_HOME environment variable not being set and Java not being installed.\n    - Solution: Java was required for building the Gradle-based project but was missing from the Ubuntu environment. The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) installation. The solution involved installing the default JDK package using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed Java version is incompatible with the project's build tool.\n    - Solution: The Gradle wrapper version was outdated and incompatible with the newer Java version (e.g., Java 21), causing build failures. The root cause was a version mismatch between the Java runtime and the build tool. The solution was to install an older, compatible Java version (OpenJDK 11).\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The Java Development Kit (JDK) was not installed, causing the initial Maven build command to fail.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a JDK installation, which is required for compiling and running Java projects. The solution was to install OpenJDK 11 using the system package manager, ensuring the necessary Java runtime and development tools were available in the environment.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle build failed due to missing Java Development Kit (JDK) installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java runtime environment required for Gradle operations. The Dockerfile specified 'openjdk-11-jdk-headless' as a dependency, but it was not installed in the environment. The solution involved updating the package index and installing the required JDK package using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk-headless\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: A build tool requiring Java was missing from the environment.\n    - Solution: The ANTLR parser generation step failed because the Java executable was not found, indicating that the Java Development Kit (JDK) was not installed. The root cause was the absence of JDK in the environment configuration. The solution was to install the default JDK using the system package manager to enable tools like ANTLR to run.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was missing, causing test failures during project execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Maven package in the environment. Maven is required for running certain integration tests in the project, specifically for the jib-maven-plugin module. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the command not found errors and allowed tests to pass.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was not installed on the system, causing the 'mvn' command to be unavailable for building the Java project.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Maven in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the unavailability of the build tool.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The initial build command failed due to Java not being installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) in the environment, which is required for building and running Java-based projects. This prevented Maven commands from executing. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 11 using the system package manager to provide the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Java runtime not installed, causing Maven build failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) in the environment, which is required for compiling and running Java projects. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 using the system package manager, providing the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- Maven\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: 8, 11, 21\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: pom.xml\n  install_command: mvn package\n  name: Maven\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - JDK (Java Development Kit)\ntest_framework:\n- Maven (via mvn test)\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle test command failed due to missing Java Development Kit (JDK).\n    - Solution: The JDK was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for Java-based projects. The root cause was the absence of Java in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing the default JDK package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle build command failed due to the JAVA_HOME environment variable not being set and Java not being installed.\n    - Solution: Java was required for building the Gradle-based project but was missing from the Ubuntu environment. The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) installation. The solution involved installing the default JDK package using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed Java version is incompatible with the project's build tool.\n    - Solution: The Gradle wrapper version was outdated and incompatible with the newer Java version (e.g., Java 21), causing build failures. The root cause was a version mismatch between the Java runtime and the build tool. The solution was to install an older, compatible Java version (OpenJDK 11).\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The Java Development Kit (JDK) was not installed, causing the initial Maven build command to fail.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a JDK installation, which is required for compiling and running Java projects. The solution was to install OpenJDK 11 using the system package manager, ensuring the necessary Java runtime and development tools were available in the environment.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle build failed due to missing Java Development Kit (JDK) installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java runtime environment required for Gradle operations. The Dockerfile specified 'openjdk-11-jdk-headless' as a dependency, but it was not installed in the environment. The solution involved updating the package index and installing the required JDK package using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk-headless\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: A build tool requiring Java was missing from the environment.\n    - Solution: The ANTLR parser generation step failed because the Java executable was not found, indicating that the Java Development Kit (JDK) was not installed. The root cause was the absence of JDK in the environment configuration. The solution was to install the default JDK using the system package manager to enable tools like ANTLR to run.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was missing, causing test failures during project execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Maven package in the environment. Maven is required for running certain integration tests in the project, specifically for the jib-maven-plugin module. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the command not found errors and allowed tests to pass.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was not installed on the system, causing the 'mvn' command to be unavailable for building the Java project.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Maven in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the unavailability of the build tool.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The initial build command failed due to Java not being installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) in the environment, which is required for building and running Java-based projects. This prevented Maven commands from executing. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 11 using the system package manager to provide the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Java runtime not installed, causing Maven build failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) in the environment, which is required for compiling and running Java projects. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 using the system package manager, providing the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install an older, compatible Java version (OpenJDK 11).\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The Java Development Kit (JDK) was not installed, causing the initial Maven build command to fail.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a JDK installation, which is required for compiling and running Java projects. The solution was to install OpenJDK 11 using the system package manager, ensuring the necessary Java runtime and development tools were available in the environment.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle build failed due to missing Java Development Kit (JDK) installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java runtime environment required for Gradle operations. The Dockerfile specified 'openjdk-11-jdk-headless' as a dependency, but it was not installed in the environment. The solution involved updating the package index and installing the required JDK package using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk-headless\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: A build tool requiring Java was missing from the environment.\n    - Solution: The ANTLR parser generation step failed because the Java executable was not found, indicating that the Java Development Kit (JDK) was not installed. The root cause was the absence of JDK in the environment configuration. The solution was to install the default JDK using the system package manager to enable tools like ANTLR to run.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was missing, causing test failures during project execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Maven package in the environment. Maven is required for running certain integration tests in the project, specifically for the jib-maven-plugin module. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the command not found errors and allowed tests to pass.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was not installed on the system, causing the 'mvn' command to be unavailable for building the Java project.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Maven in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the unavailability of the build tool.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The initial build command failed due to Java not being installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) in the environment, which is required for building and running Java-based projects. This prevented Maven commands from executing. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 11 using the system package manager to provide the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Java runtime not installed, causing Maven build failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) in the environment, which is required for compiling and running Java projects. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 using the system package manager, providing the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

      "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- Maven\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: 8, 11, 21\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: pom.xml\n  install_command: mvn package\n  name: Maven\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - JDK (Java Development Kit)\ntest_framework:\n- Maven (via mvn test)\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle test command failed due to missing Java Development Kit (JDK).\n    - Solution: The JDK was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for Java-based projects. The root cause was the absence of Java in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing the default JDK package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle build command failed due to the JAVA_HOME environment variable not being set and Java not being installed.\n    - Solution: Java was required for building the Gradle-based project but was missing from the Ubuntu environment. The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) installation. The solution involved installing the default JDK package using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed Java version is incompatible with the project's build tool.\n    - Solution: The Gradle wrapper version was outdated and incompatible with the newer Java version (e.g., Java 21), causing build failures. The root cause was a version mismatch between the Java runtime and the build tool. The solution was to install an older, compatible Java version (OpenJDK 11).\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The Java Development Kit (JDK) was not installed, causing the initial Maven build command to fail.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a JDK installation, which is required for compiling and running Java projects. The solution was to install OpenJDK 11 using the system package manager, ensuring the necessary Java runtime and development tools were available in the environment.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle build failed due to missing Java Development Kit (JDK) installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java runtime environment required for Gradle operations. The Dockerfile specified 'openjdk-11-jdk-headless' as a dependency, but it was not installed in the environment. The solution involved updating the package index and installing the required JDK package using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk-headless\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: A build tool requiring Java was missing from the environment.\n    - Solution: The ANTLR parser generation step failed because the Java executable was not found, indicating that the Java Development Kit (JDK) was not installed. The root cause was the absence of JDK in the environment configuration. The solution was to install the default JDK using the system package manager to enable tools like ANTLR to run.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was missing, causing test failures during project execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Maven package in the environment. Maven is required for running certain integration tests in the project, specifically for the jib-maven-plugin module. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the command not found errors and allowed tests to pass.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was not installed on the system, causing the 'mvn' command to be unavailable for building the Java project.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Maven in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the unavailability of the build tool.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The initial build command failed due to Java not being installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) in the environment, which is required for building and running Java-based projects. This prevented Maven commands from executing. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 11 using the system package manager to provide the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Java runtime not installed, causing Maven build failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) in the environment, which is required for compiling and running Java projects. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 using the system package manager, providing the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\",\"instance_template\":\"We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\\n\\n{{repo_related_info}}\\n\\n{{cross_repo_knowledge}}\\n\\nTASK TIPS:\\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.\",\"next_step_template\":\"{{observation}}\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"next_step_no_output_template\":\"Your command ran successfully and did not produce any output.\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"strategy_template\":null,\"demonstration_template\":null,\"success_reflection_template\":\"You are an expert code assistant who just successfully repaired a software project in an automated programming session.
