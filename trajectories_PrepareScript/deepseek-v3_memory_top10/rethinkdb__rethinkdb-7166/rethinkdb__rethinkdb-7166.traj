The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager after updating the package index to resolve dependency issues.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

This led to errors during the build process. The solution was to install the required build dependencies using the system package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Externally managed environment blocking pip installations\n                - Solution: The environment enforced PEP 668 restrictions preventing system-wide pip installations. The root cause was security configurations blocking package installations. The solution was to create an isolated virtual environment to bypass these restrictions.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11-venv && python3.11 -m venv venv3.11\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: The initial setup command failed due to Python 3 not being installed in the environment\n                - Solution: The system lacked Python 3, required for project installation. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager after updating the package index to resolve dependency issues.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to create an isolated virtual environment to bypass these restrictions.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11-venv && python3.11 -m venv venv3.11\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: The initial setup command failed due to Python 3 not being installed in the environment\n                - Solution: The system lacked Python 3, required for project installation. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager after updating the package index to resolve dependency issues.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The root cause was an incomplete system package configuration. The solution was to update the local package index and install build-essential to provide the necessary tools for any compilation steps during environment setup.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n            \n            **Case2**:\n                - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n                - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n                - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n                - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing compilation failures for native dependencies\n                - Solution: The root cause was the lack of core development packages such as compilers, libraries, and configuration tools, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates with native code. This led to errors during the build process. The solution was to install the required build dependencies using the system package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Externally managed environment blocking pip installations\n                - Solution: The environment enforced PEP 668 restrictions preventing system-wide pip installations. The root cause was security configurations blocking package installations. The solution was to create an isolated virtual environment to bypass these restrictions.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11-venv && python3.11 -m venv venv3.11\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: The initial setup command failed due to Python 3 not being installed in the environment\n                - Solution: The system lacked Python 3, required for project installation. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager after updating the package index to resolve dependency issues.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n                - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n                - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n                - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing compilation failures for native dependencies\n                - Solution: The root cause was the lack of core development packages such as compilers, libraries, and configuration tools, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates with native code. This led to errors during the build process. The solution was to install the required build dependencies using the system package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Externally managed environment blocking pip installations\n                - Solution: The environment enforced PEP 668 restrictions preventing system-wide pip installations. The root cause was security configurations blocking package installations. The solution was to create an isolated virtual environment to bypass these restrictions.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11-venv && python3.11 -m venv venv3.11\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: The initial setup command failed due to Python 3 not being installed in the environment\n                - Solution: The system lacked Python 3, required for project installation. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager after updating the package index to resolve dependency issues.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n                - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n                - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n                - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing compilation failures for native dependencies\n                - Solution: The root cause was the lack of core development packages such as compilers, libraries, and configuration tools, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates with native code. This led to errors during the build process. The solution was to install the required build dependencies using the system package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Externally managed environment blocking pip installations\n                - Solution: The environment enforced PEP 668 restrictions preventing system-wide pip installations. The root cause was security configurations blocking package installations. The solution was to create an isolated virtual environment to bypass these restrictions.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11-venv && python3.11 -m venv venv3.11\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: The initial setup command failed due to Python 3 not being installed in the environment\n                - Solution: The system lacked Python 3, required for project installation. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager after updating the package index to resolve dependency issues.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n                - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n                - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n                - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing compilation failures for native dependencies\n                - Solution: The root cause was the lack of core development packages such as compilers, libraries, and configuration tools, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates with native code. This led to errors during the build process. The solution was to install the required build dependencies using the system package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Externally managed environment blocking pip installations\n                - Solution: The environment enforced PEP 668 restrictions preventing system-wide pip installations. The root cause was security configurations blocking package installations. The solution was to create an isolated virtual environment to bypass these restrictions.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11-venv && python3.11 -m venv venv3.11\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: The initial setup command failed due to Python 3 not being installed in the environment\n                - Solution: The system lacked Python 3, required for project installation. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager after updating the package index to resolve dependency issues.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n                - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n                - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing compilation failures for native dependencies\n                - Solution: The root cause was the lack of core development packages such as compilers, libraries, and configuration tools, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates with native code. This led to errors during the build process. The solution was to install the required build dependencies using the system package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Externally managed environment blocking pip installations\n                - Solution: The environment enforced PEP 668 restrictions preventing system-wide pip installations. The root cause was security configurations blocking package installations. The solution was to create an isolated virtual environment to bypass these restrictions.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11-venv && python3.11 -m venv venv3.11\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: The initial setup command failed due to Python 3 not being installed in the environment\n                - Solution: The system lacked Python 3, required for project installation. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager after updating the package index to resolve dependency issues.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The root cause was an incomplete system package configuration. The solution was to update the local package index and install build-essential to provide the necessary tools for any compilation steps during environment setup.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n            \n            **Case2**:\n                - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n                - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n                - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n                - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing compilation failures for native dependencies\n                - Solution: The root cause was the lack of core development packages such as compilers, libraries, and configuration tools, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates with native code. This led to errors during the build process. The solution was to install the required build dependencies using the system package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Externally managed environment blocking pip installations\n                - Solution: The environment enforced PEP 668 restrictions preventing system-wide pip installations. The root cause was security configurations blocking package installations. The solution was to create an isolated virtual environment to bypass these restrictions.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11-venv && python3.11 -m venv venv3.11\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: The initial setup command failed due to Python 3 not being installed in the environment\n                - Solution: The system lacked Python 3, required for project installation. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager after updating the package index to resolve dependency issues.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The root cause was an incomplete system package configuration. The solution was to update the local package index and install build-essential to provide the necessary tools for any compilation steps during environment setup.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n            \n            **Case2**:\n                - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n                - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n                - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n                - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing compilation failures for native dependencies\n                - Solution: The root cause was the lack of core development packages such as compilers, libraries, and configuration tools, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates with native code. This led to errors during the build process. The solution was to install the required build dependencies using the system package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Externally managed environment blocking pip installations\n                - Solution: The environment enforced PEP 668 restrictions preventing system-wide pip installations. The root cause was security configurations blocking package installations. The solution was to create an isolated virtual environment to bypass these restrictions.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11-venv && python3.11 -m venv venv3.11\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: The initial setup command failed due to Python 3 not being installed in the environment\n                - Solution: The system lacked Python 3, required for project installation. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager after updating the package index to resolve dependency issues.\n                - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\",\"instance_template\":\"We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\\n\\nHere is the repository related information:\\n{{repo_related_info}}\\n\\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\\n{{cross_repo_knowledge}}\\n\\nTASK TIPS:\\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.\",\"next_step_template\":\"{{observation}}\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"next_step_no_output_template\":\"Your command ran successfully and did not produce any output.\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"strategy_template\":null,\"demonstration_template\":null,\"success_reflection_template\":\"You are an expert code assistant who just successfully repaired a software project in an automated programming session.
