The root cause was the lack of development packages for OpenSSL. The solution was to install the libssl-dev package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The initial compiler and build tool check failed due to missing software\n    - Solution: The gcc and make tools were not installed on the Ubuntu system, which are essential for compiling and building C/C++ projects from source. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking the basic build toolchain. The solution was to install the build-essential package using apt-get, which provides gcc, make, and related dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The cmake build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the cmake package in the environment, which is required for building CMake-based projects. The solution involved updating the package index and installing cmake using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: OpenSSL development headers were missing during compilation\n    - Solution: The OpenSSL library headers were required for SSL support but were not present. The root cause was the absence of the OpenSSL development package. The solution was to install libssl-dev to provide the necessary headers.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The initial compiler and build tool check failed due to missing software\n    - Solution: The gcc and make tools were not installed on the Ubuntu system, which are essential for compiling and building C/C++ projects from source. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking the basic build toolchain. The solution was to install the build-essential package using apt-get, which provides gcc, make, and related dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The cmake build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the cmake package in the environment, which is required for building CMake-based projects. The solution involved updating the package index and installing cmake using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: OpenSSL development headers were missing during compilation\n    - Solution: The OpenSSL library headers were required for SSL support but were not present. The root cause was the absence of the OpenSSL development package. The solution was to install libssl-dev to provide the necessary headers.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - Flex\n  - Bison\n  - YAML library/headers\n  - OpenSSL library/headers\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libssl-dev\n  - libyaml-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Building CMake from source failed due to missing OpenSSL development libraries\n    - Solution: The CMake bootstrap process required OpenSSL headers and libraries, which were missing in the environment. The root cause was the lack of development packages for OpenSSL. The solution was to install the libssl-dev package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The initial compiler and build tool check failed due to missing software\n    - Solution: The gcc and make tools were not installed on the Ubuntu system, which are essential for compiling and building C/C++ projects from source. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking the basic build toolchain. The solution was to install the build-essential package using apt-get, which provides gcc, make, and related dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The cmake build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the cmake package in the environment, which is required for building CMake-based projects. The solution involved updating the package index and installing cmake using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: OpenSSL development headers were missing during compilation\n    - Solution: The OpenSSL library headers were required for SSL support but were not present. The root cause was the absence of the OpenSSL development package. The solution was to install libssl-dev to provide the necessary headers.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - Flex\n  - Bison\n  - YAML library/headers\n  - OpenSSL library/headers\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libssl-dev\n  - libyaml-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Building CMake from source failed due to missing OpenSSL development libraries\n    - Solution: The CMake bootstrap process required OpenSSL headers and libraries, which were missing in the environment. The root cause was the lack of development packages for OpenSSL. The solution was to install the libssl-dev package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The initial compiler and build tool check failed due to missing software\n    - Solution: The gcc and make tools were not installed on the Ubuntu system, which are essential for compiling and building C/C++ projects from source. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking the basic build toolchain. The solution was to install the build-essential package using apt-get, which provides gcc, make, and related dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The cmake build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the cmake package in the environment, which is required for building CMake-based projects. The solution involved updating the package index and installing cmake using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: OpenSSL development headers were missing during compilation\n    - Solution: The OpenSSL library headers were required for SSL support but were not present. The root cause was the absence of the OpenSSL development package. The solution was to install libssl-dev to provide the necessary headers.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - Flex\n  - Bison\n  - YAML library/headers\n  - OpenSSL library/headers\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libssl-dev\n  - libyaml-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Building CMake from source failed due to missing OpenSSL development libraries\n    - Solution: The CMake bootstrap process required OpenSSL headers and libraries, which were missing in the environment. The root cause was the lack of development packages for OpenSSL. The solution was to install the libssl-dev package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The initial compiler and build tool check failed due to missing software\n    - Solution: The gcc and make tools were not installed on the Ubuntu system, which are essential for compiling and building C/C++ projects from source. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking the basic build toolchain. The solution was to install the build-essential package using apt-get, which provides gcc, make, and related dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The cmake build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the cmake package in the environment, which is required for building CMake-based projects. The solution involved updating the package index and installing cmake using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: OpenSSL development headers were missing during compilation\n    - Solution: The OpenSSL library headers were required for SSL support but were not present. The root cause was the absence of the OpenSSL development package. The solution was to install libssl-dev to provide the necessary headers.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them.

The root cause was the lack of development packages for OpenSSL. The solution was to install the libssl-dev package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The initial compiler and build tool check failed due to missing software\n    - Solution: The gcc and make tools were not installed on the Ubuntu system, which are essential for compiling and building C/C++ projects from source. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking the basic build toolchain. The solution was to install the build-essential package using apt-get, which provides gcc, make, and related dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The cmake build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the cmake package in the environment, which is required for building CMake-based projects. The solution involved updating the package index and installing cmake using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: OpenSSL development headers were missing during compilation\n    - Solution: The OpenSSL library headers were required for SSL support but were not present. The root cause was the absence of the OpenSSL development package. The solution was to install libssl-dev to provide the necessary headers.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - Flex\n  - Bison\n  - YAML library/headers\n  - OpenSSL library/headers\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libssl-dev\n  - libyaml-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Building CMake from source failed due to missing OpenSSL development libraries\n    - Solution: The CMake bootstrap process required OpenSSL headers and libraries, which were missing in the environment. The root cause was the lack of development packages for OpenSSL. The solution was to install the libssl-dev package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The initial compiler and build tool check failed due to missing software\n    - Solution: The gcc and make tools were not installed on the Ubuntu system, which are essential for compiling and building C/C++ projects from source. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking the basic build toolchain. The solution was to install the build-essential package using apt-get, which provides gcc, make, and related dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The cmake build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the cmake package in the environment, which is required for building CMake-based projects. The solution involved updating the package index and installing cmake using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: OpenSSL development headers were missing during compilation\n    - Solution: The OpenSSL library headers were required for SSL support but were not present. The root cause was the absence of the OpenSSL development package. The solution was to install libssl-dev to provide the necessary headers.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - Flex\n  - Bison\n  - YAML library/headers\n  - OpenSSL library/headers\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libssl-dev\n  - libyaml-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Building CMake from source failed due to missing OpenSSL development libraries\n    - Solution: The CMake bootstrap process required OpenSSL headers and libraries, which were missing in the environment. The root cause was the lack of development packages for OpenSSL. The solution was to install the libssl-dev package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The initial compiler and build tool check failed due to missing software\n    - Solution: The gcc and make tools were not installed on the Ubuntu system, which are essential for compiling and building C/C++ projects from source. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking the basic build toolchain. The solution was to install the build-essential package using apt-get, which provides gcc, make, and related dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The cmake build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the cmake package in the environment, which is required for building CMake-based projects. The solution involved updating the package index and installing cmake using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: OpenSSL development headers were missing during compilation\n    - Solution: The OpenSSL library headers were required for SSL support but were not present. The root cause was the absence of the OpenSSL development package. The solution was to install libssl-dev to provide the necessary headers.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - Flex\n  - Bison\n  - YAML library/headers\n  - OpenSSL library/headers\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libssl-dev\n  - libyaml-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Building CMake from source failed due to missing OpenSSL development libraries\n    - Solution: The CMake bootstrap process required OpenSSL headers and libraries, which were missing in the environment. The root cause was the lack of development packages for OpenSSL. The solution was to install the libssl-dev package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The initial compiler and build tool check failed due to missing software\n    - Solution: The gcc and make tools were not installed on the Ubuntu system, which are essential for compiling and building C/C++ projects from source. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking the basic build toolchain. The solution was to install the build-essential package using apt-get, which provides gcc, make, and related dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The cmake build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the cmake package in the environment, which is required for building CMake-based projects. The solution involved updating the package index and installing cmake using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: OpenSSL development headers were missing during compilation\n    - Solution: The OpenSSL library headers were required for SSL support but were not present. The root cause was the absence of the OpenSSL development package. The solution was to install libssl-dev to provide the necessary headers.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you.

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - Flex\n  - Bison\n  - YAML library/headers\n  - OpenSSL library/headers\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libssl-dev\n  - libyaml-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Building CMake from source failed due to missing OpenSSL development libraries\n    - Solution: The CMake bootstrap process required OpenSSL headers and libraries, which were missing in the environment. The root cause was the lack of development packages for OpenSSL. The solution was to install the libssl-dev package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The initial compiler and build tool check failed due to missing software\n    - Solution: The gcc and make tools were not installed on the Ubuntu system, which are essential for compiling and building C/C++ projects from source. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking the basic build toolchain. The solution was to install the build-essential package using apt-get, which provides gcc, make, and related dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The cmake build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the cmake package in the environment, which is required for building CMake-based projects. The solution involved updating the package index and installing cmake using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: OpenSSL development headers were missing during compilation\n    - Solution: The OpenSSL library headers were required for SSL support but were not present. The root cause was the absence of the OpenSSL development package. The solution was to install libssl-dev to provide the necessary headers.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - Flex\n  - Bison\n  - YAML library/headers\n  - OpenSSL library/headers\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libssl-dev\n  - libyaml-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Building CMake from source failed due to missing OpenSSL development libraries\n    - Solution: The CMake bootstrap process required OpenSSL headers and libraries, which were missing in the environment. The root cause was the lack of development packages for OpenSSL. The solution was to install the libssl-dev package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The initial compiler and build tool check failed due to missing software\n    - Solution: The gcc and make tools were not installed on the Ubuntu system, which are essential for compiling and building C/C++ projects from source. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking the basic build toolchain. The solution was to install the build-essential package using apt-get, which provides gcc, make, and related dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The cmake build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the cmake package in the environment, which is required for building CMake-based projects. The solution involved updating the package index and installing cmake using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: OpenSSL development headers were missing during compilation\n    - Solution: The OpenSSL library headers were required for SSL support but were not present. The root cause was the absence of the OpenSSL development package. The solution was to install libssl-dev to provide the necessary headers.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - Flex\n  - Bison\n  - YAML library/headers\n  - OpenSSL library/headers\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libssl-dev\n  - libyaml-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Building CMake from source failed due to missing OpenSSL development libraries\n    - Solution: The CMake bootstrap process required OpenSSL headers and libraries, which were missing in the environment. The root cause was the lack of development packages for OpenSSL. The solution was to install the libssl-dev package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The initial compiler and build tool check failed due to missing software\n    - Solution: The gcc and make tools were not installed on the Ubuntu system, which are essential for compiling and building C/C++ projects from source. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking the basic build toolchain. The solution was to install the build-essential package using apt-get, which provides gcc, make, and related dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The cmake build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the cmake package in the environment, which is required for building CMake-based projects. The solution involved updating the package index and installing cmake using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: OpenSSL development headers were missing during compilation\n    - Solution: The OpenSSL library headers were required for SSL support but were not present. The root cause was the absence of the OpenSSL development package. The solution was to install libssl-dev to provide the necessary headers.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The root cause was the lack of development packages for OpenSSL. The solution was to install the libssl-dev package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The initial compiler and build tool check failed due to missing software\n    - Solution: The gcc and make tools were not installed on the Ubuntu system, which are essential for compiling and building C/C++ projects from source. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking the basic build toolchain. The solution was to install the build-essential package using apt-get, which provides gcc, make, and related dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The cmake build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the cmake package in the environment, which is required for building CMake-based projects. The solution involved updating the package index and installing cmake using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: OpenSSL development headers were missing during compilation\n    - Solution: The OpenSSL library headers were required for SSL support but were not present. The root cause was the absence of the OpenSSL development package. The solution was to install libssl-dev to provide the necessary headers.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - Flex\n  - Bison\n  - YAML library/headers\n  - OpenSSL library/headers\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libssl-dev\n  - libyaml-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Building CMake from source failed due to missing OpenSSL development libraries\n    - Solution: The CMake bootstrap process required OpenSSL headers and libraries, which were missing in the environment. The root cause was the lack of development packages for OpenSSL. The solution was to install the libssl-dev package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The initial compiler and build tool check failed due to missing software\n    - Solution: The gcc and make tools were not installed on the Ubuntu system, which are essential for compiling and building C/C++ projects from source. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking the basic build toolchain. The solution was to install the build-essential package using apt-get, which provides gcc, make, and related dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The cmake build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the cmake package in the environment, which is required for building CMake-based projects. The solution involved updating the package index and installing cmake using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: OpenSSL development headers were missing during compilation\n    - Solution: The OpenSSL library headers were required for SSL support but were not present. The root cause was the absence of the OpenSSL development package. The solution was to install libssl-dev to provide the necessary headers.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - Flex\n  - Bison\n  - YAML library/headers\n  - OpenSSL library/headers\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libssl-dev\n  - libyaml-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Building CMake from source failed due to missing OpenSSL development libraries\n    - Solution: The CMake bootstrap process required OpenSSL headers and libraries, which were missing in the environment. The root cause was the lack of development packages for OpenSSL. The solution was to install the libssl-dev package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The initial compiler and build tool check failed due to missing software\n    - Solution: The gcc and make tools were not installed on the Ubuntu system, which are essential for compiling and building C/C++ projects from source. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking the basic build toolchain. The solution was to install the build-essential package using apt-get, which provides gcc, make, and related dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The cmake build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the cmake package in the environment, which is required for building CMake-based projects. The solution involved updating the package index and installing cmake using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: OpenSSL development headers were missing during compilation\n    - Solution: The OpenSSL library headers were required for SSL support but were not present. The root cause was the absence of the OpenSSL development package. The solution was to install libssl-dev to provide the necessary headers.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - Flex\n  - Bison\n  - YAML library/headers\n  - OpenSSL library/headers\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libssl-dev\n  - libyaml-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Building CMake from source failed due to missing OpenSSL development libraries\n    - Solution: The CMake bootstrap process required OpenSSL headers and libraries, which were missing in the environment. The root cause was the lack of development packages for OpenSSL. The solution was to install the libssl-dev package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The initial compiler and build tool check failed due to missing software\n    - Solution: The gcc and make tools were not installed on the Ubuntu system, which are essential for compiling and building C/C++ projects from source. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking the basic build toolchain. The solution was to install the build-essential package using apt-get, which provides gcc, make, and related dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The cmake build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the cmake package in the environment, which is required for building CMake-based projects. The solution involved updating the package index and installing cmake using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: OpenSSL development headers were missing during compilation\n    - Solution: The OpenSSL library headers were required for SSL support but were not present. The root cause was the absence of the OpenSSL development package. The solution was to install libssl-dev to provide the necessary headers.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - Flex\n  - Bison\n  - YAML library/headers\n  - OpenSSL library/headers\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libssl-dev\n  - libyaml-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Building CMake from source failed due to missing OpenSSL development libraries\n    - Solution: The CMake bootstrap process required OpenSSL headers and libraries, which were missing in the environment. The root cause was the lack of development packages for OpenSSL. The solution was to install the libssl-dev package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The initial compiler and build tool check failed due to missing software\n    - Solution: The gcc and make tools were not installed on the Ubuntu system, which are essential for compiling and building C/C++ projects from source. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking the basic build toolchain. The solution was to install the build-essential package using apt-get, which provides gcc, make, and related dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The cmake build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the cmake package in the environment, which is required for building CMake-based projects. The solution involved updating the package index and installing cmake using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: OpenSSL development headers were missing during compilation\n    - Solution: The OpenSSL library headers were required for SSL support but were not present. The root cause was the absence of the OpenSSL development package. The solution was to install libssl-dev to provide the necessary headers.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - Flex\n  - Bison\n  - YAML library/headers\n  - OpenSSL library/headers\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libssl-dev\n  - libyaml-dev\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Building CMake from source failed due to missing OpenSSL development libraries\n    - Solution: The CMake bootstrap process required OpenSSL headers and libraries, which were missing in the environment. The root cause was the lack of development packages for OpenSSL. The solution was to install the libssl-dev package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: The initial compiler and build tool check failed due to missing software\n    - Solution: The gcc and make tools were not installed on the Ubuntu system, which are essential for compiling and building C/C++ projects from source. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking the basic build toolchain. The solution was to install the build-essential package using apt-get, which provides gcc, make, and related dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The cmake build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the cmake package in the environment, which is required for building CMake-based projects. The solution involved updating the package index and installing cmake using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: OpenSSL development headers were missing during compilation\n    - Solution: The OpenSSL library headers were required for SSL support but were not present. The root cause was the absence of the OpenSSL development package. The solution was to install libssl-dev to provide the necessary headers.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The root cause was the lack of development packages for OpenSSL. The solution was to install the libssl-dev package.\\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\\n\\n**Case2**:\\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\\n\\n**Case3**:\\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\\n\\n**Case4**:\\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\\n\\n**Case5**:\\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\\n\\n**Case6**:\\n    - Problem: The initial compiler and build tool check failed due to missing software\\n    - Solution: The gcc and make tools were not installed on the Ubuntu system, which are essential for compiling and building C/C++ projects from source. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking the basic build toolchain. The solution was to install the build-essential package using apt-get, which provides gcc, make, and related dependencies.\\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\\n\\n**Case7**:\\n    - Problem: The cmake build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system\\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the cmake package in the environment, which is required for building CMake-based projects. The solution involved updating the package index and installing cmake using the apt package manager.\\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake\\n\\n**Case8**:\\n    - Problem: OpenSSL development headers were missing during compilation\\n    - Solution: The OpenSSL library headers were required for SSL support but were not present. The root cause was the absence of the OpenSSL development package. The solution was to install libssl-dev to provide the necessary headers.\\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\\n\\n**Case9**:\\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\\n\\n**Case10**:\\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\\n\\n\\nTASK TIPS:\\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.\",\"next_step_template\":\"{{observation}}\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"next_step_no_output_template\":\"Your command ran successfully and did not produce any output.\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"strategy_template\":null,\"demonstration_template\":null,\"success_reflection_template\":\"You are an expert code assistant who just successfully repaired a software project in an automated programming session.
