"FAILED\n1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The test suite failed to execute successfully. Multiple attempts to run the tests resulted in errors, including \"WebAssembly.instantiate(): Out of memory\" and \"input.includes is not a function\". The test framework did not generate a complete test report structure.\n2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - While the core modules could be imported (as evidenced by the successful dependency installation), we were unable to verify core functionality through test execution or example code due to the test failures. The environment configuration process did not reach the stage of demonstrating core features.\n\nThe environment configuration process successfully installed the correct Node.js version (16.20.2) and Yarn, and completed dependency installation. However, the critical test execution phase failed repeatedly with different errors, preventing verification of both test suite execution and core functionality. The memory-related errors suggest potential environment constraints that would need to be addressed for successful test execution."
