"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The `go test ./...` command successfully executed multiple test suites across the project. While some tests failed due to missing external services (e.g., Redis, Memcached), many tests passed, and the test framework generated a complete test report structure. This meets the success criterion of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully, even if some individual test cases failed.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality of the project was verified through the successful execution of several test suites (e.g., `github.com/beego/beego/v2/core/logs`, `github.com/beego/beego/v2/server/web`). Additionally, the project was built and formatted successfully, indicating that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally. The basic API calls and core features were demonstrated through the test execution.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful because both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) were met, despite some test failures due to external dependencies not being available in the environment."
