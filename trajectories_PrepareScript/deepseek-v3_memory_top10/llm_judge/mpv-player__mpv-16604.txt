"FAILED\nDetailed reasoning:\n1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1): The build process failed to complete due to compilation errors related to FFmpeg API version mismatches. No test suite was able to start or execute, as the project could not be successfully built. The errors indicate missing definitions for AVChannelLayout and AV_FRAME_FLAG_* constants, which are critical for the build process.\n\n2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2): Since the build failed, core functional modules could not be imported or tested. The agent attempted to modify the code to work with older FFmpeg versions, but this was not sufficient to achieve a successful build. Basic API calls and core features could not be verified due to the build failure.\n\nThe environment configuration was unsuccessful because neither of the two success criteria were met. The fundamental issue appears to be a version incompatibility between the project's requirements and the available FFmpeg libraries in the environment."
