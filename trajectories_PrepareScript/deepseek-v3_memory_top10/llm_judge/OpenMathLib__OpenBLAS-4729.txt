"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed the test suite with all 120 test cases passing. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, and the suite completed without any critical failures.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules were built and installed correctly. The core features were demonstrated through the successful execution of the test cases, confirming that the library is functioning as expected. The installation of the library in `/usr/local/lib` and `/usr/local/include/openblas` ensures that it can be used by other applications.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria, as the test suite completed successfully and the core functionality was verified."
