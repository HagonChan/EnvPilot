"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed (`npm run test`), completing with a test report showing 118 tests across 9 suites, with 114 passes and 3 failures. The test framework generated a complete report structure, meeting Condition 1.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules were successfully built (`npm run build`) and could be imported/used. The project's core functionality was demonstrated through the test execution, meeting Condition 2 despite some test failures (which are acceptable per criteria). \n\nThe environment was correctly configured for the Node.js project (despite initial C/C++ task mismatch), and the agent adapted to the actual repository requirements (Node.js/npm). The test failures were non-critical (missing `nc` command and assertion differences), not preventing the suite from completing or core functionality from working."
