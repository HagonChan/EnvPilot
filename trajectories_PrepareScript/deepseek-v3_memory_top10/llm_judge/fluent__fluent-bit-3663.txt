"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully built the project and executed the test suite. Although 3 out of 68 tests failed, the majority (96%) passed, and the test framework completed execution, generating a full test report. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully, even with individual test failures.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent verified that the main functional modules could be imported and used normally. The build process completed successfully, and core features were demonstrated through the execution of example code (e.g., `hello_world`). This satisfies the condition that core functionality is operational.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning:\n- **Condition 1**: The test suite ran to completion, with 65 out of 68 tests passing. The failures were non-critical (e.g., Elasticsearch output plugin test) and did not prevent the test framework from generating a complete report.\n- **Condition 2**: The project built successfully, and core modules (e.g., `fluent-bit` binary, shared libraries) were verified to work. Example programs (`hello_world`, `hello_world_cpp`) executed without issues, demonstrating basic functionality.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful as both critical criteria were met. The minor test failures do not impact the overall success, as they are likely due to environment-specific issues (e.g., missing Elasticsearch service) rather than fundamental configuration problems."
