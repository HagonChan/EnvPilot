"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The `cargo test` command successfully executed multiple test suites, including unit tests and doc-tests, all of which passed. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, meeting Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality was verified by successfully installing `mdBook` from source using `cargo install mdbook` and checking its version with `mdbook --version`. The main functional modules were imported and used normally, and basic API calls returned expected results, meeting Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful as both conditions are satisfied: the test suite completed execution, and the core functionality was verified."
