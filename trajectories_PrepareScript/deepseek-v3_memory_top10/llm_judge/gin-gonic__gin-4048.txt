"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite for the repository was successfully executed. All individual test cases for the `gin`, `binding`, and `render` packages passed after resolving the time zone issue (`Asia/Chongqing`). The test framework generated a complete test report structure, and the coverage report showed 99.2% of statements covered. This meets the success criteria for test suite execution.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules (`gin`, `binding`, `render`) were imported and used normally. Basic API calls returned expected results, and core features were demonstrated through the execution of the test cases. This confirms that the core functionality of the repository is working as expected.\n\nThe environment configuration was successful as both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) were met. The initial issues (missing `make`, time zone configuration) were resolved, and the tests now pass without errors."
