"FAILED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite failed to execute successfully. The pytest command resulted in 788 errors during collection, primarily due to missing modules (`sklearn.__check_build._check_build`) and compilation issues. No test suite could complete execution, which violates Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: Core modules could not be imported or were fundamentally broken, as evidenced by the ImportError for `sklearn.__check_build._check_build`. Basic API calls and core features could not be demonstrated, failing Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe environment configuration was unsuccessful because:\n- The project could not be properly installed in development mode due to compatibility issues with Python 3.10 and dependency resolution problems\n- Critical compilation errors prevented the building of Cython extensions\n- No test suite could complete execution\n- Core functionality verification was impossible due to fundamental import failures\n\nThe agent exhausted all reasonable attempts to resolve the issues (including dependency version adjustments, system package installations, and Python version management) but could not achieve a working configuration within the given constraints."
