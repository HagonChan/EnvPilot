"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully, completing with a report showing 959 tests passed (OK: 959, KO: 0, Crash: 0). This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully, even with some skipped tests.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The build process completed without errors, and the core functionality was verified through the successful execution of the test suite. The main functional modules (e.g., mruby interpreter, mirb shell) were built and tested, confirming that the core features are operational.\n\nThe environment configuration was successful as both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) were met. The initial issues with Ruby 3.0 compatibility were resolved by updating the `Rakefile` to use modern syntax for `FileUtils` methods, allowing the tests to run and pass."
