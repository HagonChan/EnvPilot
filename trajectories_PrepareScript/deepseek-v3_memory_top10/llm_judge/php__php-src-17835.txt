"FAILED\n1. The repository being analyzed is clearly a PHP project (php-src) based on the README.md and file structure, not a Go project as specified in the task requirements\n2. No Go-related files (*.go, go.mod, go.sum) were found in the repository\n3. All CI/CD configurations found were PHP-specific and contained no Go-related setup or test commands\n4. The agent correctly identified the mismatch but couldn't proceed with the intended Go environment configuration\n5. Neither of the success criteria could be evaluated since the wrong project type was provided\n6. The task fundamentally cannot be completed due to the incorrect repository/language specification"
