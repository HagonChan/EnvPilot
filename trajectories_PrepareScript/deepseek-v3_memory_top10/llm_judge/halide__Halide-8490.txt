"FAILED\n1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**: The agent was unable to successfully execute any test suite. The build process failed due to incompatible LLVM versions (required 17-20, available 15). No test suite could be started or completed.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**: The agent could not verify core functionality as the project failed to build. Core modules could not be imported or tested due to the build failure.\n\nThe environment configuration did not meet either of the success criteria. The primary issue was the inability to install a compatible version of LLVM (17-20) required by the project, despite multiple attempts to resolve dependencies and version conflicts. The highest available LLVM version in the Ubuntu repositories (15) was insufficient, and attempts to manually install newer versions failed due to unavailable binaries."
