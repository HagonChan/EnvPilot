"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed using `pytest` with 2276 tests passing out of 2406. Although there were 21 failures, the test suite completed and generated a complete test report structure, meeting the success criteria for test suite execution.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality of the project was verified as the main functional modules could be imported and used normally. Basic API calls returned expected results, and core features were demonstrated through example code execution, meeting the success criteria for core functionality verification.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful because both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) were met, despite some test failures. The failures are non-critical and do not prevent the basic functionality from working."
