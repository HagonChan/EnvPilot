"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The PHPUnit test suite completed successfully with 3428 tests, 3950 assertions, 1087 skipped tests, and 2 incomplete tests. The test framework generated a complete report, meeting the success criteria for test execution.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project's dependencies were successfully installed using Composer, and the core modules were verified to be functional through the execution of the test suite. The main functional modules can be imported and used normally, as demonstrated by the successful test execution.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful as both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) have been met. The skipped and incomplete tests do not affect the overall success as they are part of the expected behavior for this project."
