"PASSED\n\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed the test suite (`ant -noinput test`) after resolving compatibility issues. The test suite completed successfully with all tests passing, as evidenced by the \"BUILD SUCCESSFUL\" message and the detailed test report showing numerous \"[PASS]\" entries for various test cases.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent verified core functionality by:\n   - Successfully building the project (`ant -noinput dist`)\n   - Running the test suite which exercises the main functional modules\n   - Ensuring the Java environment was properly configured (OpenJDK 17)\n   - Resolving dependency issues (lombok.patcher compatibility)\n   - Modifying code to maintain compatibility while preserving functionality\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria:\n- The test suite completed execution successfully\n- Core functionality was verified through successful build and test execution\n\nThe agent demonstrated proper troubleshooting by:\n1. Identifying and resolving the compilation error in EclipsePatcher.java\n2. Handling Java version compatibility issues\n3. Following the repository's build and test procedures as outlined in the CI configuration\n4. Making minimal necessary changes to achieve successful execution while maintaining project integrity"
