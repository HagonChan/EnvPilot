"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed the test suite, with all 1239 test cases passing and no failures. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, confirming that the test suite completed successfully.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent built the project from source and verified core functionality by running the executable in headless mode. Although the initial run failed due to the lack of an X11 display, the agent correctly identified the issue and successfully ran the tests in headless mode, demonstrating that the core modules can be imported and used normally.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria, as the test suite completed successfully and core functionality was verified. The agent addressed all encountered issues, such as missing dependencies and build configuration problems, ensuring the environment was properly set up."
