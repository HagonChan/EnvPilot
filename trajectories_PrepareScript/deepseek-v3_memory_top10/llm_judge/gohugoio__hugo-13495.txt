"FAILED\nDetailed Reasoning:\n1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**: The test suite failed to complete successfully. While some tests passed, several critical tests failed, including:\n   - The `dart-sass` binary failed to execute due to missing Dart runtime dependencies\n   - Multiple test cases in the Hugo test suite failed with errors\n   - The test command exited with a non-zero status code (1), indicating test failures\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**: While the basic Go environment was set up correctly and some core modules could be imported, the test failures indicate fundamental issues with the environment configuration that prevent proper verification of core functionality. The `dart-sass` dependency failure particularly affects the project's ability to process Sass files, which is likely a core feature.\n\n3. **Failure Analysis**:\n   - The environment lacks the complete set of required dependencies (specifically the Dart runtime for `dart-sass`)\n   - The test suite did not complete successfully as required by the success criteria\n   - While some tests passed, the presence of critical failures means the environment is not fully functional\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The environment configuration does not meet either of the two success criteria because:\n   - No complete test suite executed successfully (Condition 1 failed)\n   - Core functionality cannot be fully verified due to test failures (Condition 2 failed)"
