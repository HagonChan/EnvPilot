"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The Maven build process successfully executed multiple test suites, as evidenced by the test reports generated in the `shenyu-admin/target/surefire-reports` directory. While some tests failed (as indicated by the build failure message), the test framework completed execution and produced detailed reports for all test cases. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The build process successfully compiled the project and its dependencies, indicating that core modules can be imported and used. The test execution (even with failures) demonstrates that the basic framework is operational. The presence of comprehensive test reports confirms the testing infrastructure is working as expected, meeting Condition 2.\n\nNote: While some tests failed, this is acceptable per the success criteria which states \"Individual test case failures are acceptable as long as the suite completes.\" The key requirements of having a complete test suite execution and core functionality verification were both satisfied."
