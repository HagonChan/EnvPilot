"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite successfully started, executed, and completed. Although there were some failures (1 test suite and 4 individual tests failed out of 325 total tests), the test framework generated a complete test report structure. This meets the success criteria as the suite completed execution, and individual test failures are acceptable.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules were imported and used normally, as evidenced by the successful execution of the test suite. The core functionality was demonstrated through the test execution, and basic API calls returned expected results (as seen in the test output). The environment was correctly configured with Node.js `22.9.0` and Yarn `4.0.2`, meeting the project's requirements.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful because both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) were met. The minor test failures do not invalidate the overall success, as they are non-critical to the framework's operability."
