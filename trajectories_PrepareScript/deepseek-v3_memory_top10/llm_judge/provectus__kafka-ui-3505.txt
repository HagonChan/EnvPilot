"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The Maven build process successfully executed the test suite, as evidenced by the test reports generated in `kafka-ui-api/target/surefire-reports`. While there were 91 test failures, the test framework completed execution and produced detailed reports for each test class. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish, even with individual test failures.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project compiled successfully when running `./mvnw -B -V -ntp clean package -DskipTests`, demonstrating that the core modules can be built. The initial test run (before skipping tests) also showed that the test framework was able to initialize and attempt to run tests, indicating basic functionality of the testing infrastructure.\n\nThe test failures appear to be primarily related to missing Docker functionality, which is an environmental limitation rather than a configuration issue. The agent successfully installed all required dependencies (Java 17, Maven) and the build system operated as expected. The Docker-related issues don't invalidate the environment configuration success since they represent test-specific dependencies rather than core functionality problems."
