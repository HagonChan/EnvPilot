"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The unit tests (`npm run test-unit`) completed successfully with all 62 test suites passing and 1637 tests passing (2 skipped). This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully, even though some integration and E2E tests had failures.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project was successfully built (`npm run build`) and the main functional modules can be imported and used normally, as demonstrated by the successful execution of the unit tests. The core functionality is verified to be working.\n\nWhile there were some failures in integration and E2E tests (likely due to Playwright/browser setup issues), the success criteria only requires that at least one test suite completes successfully and core functionality works, both of which were achieved. The unit test execution provides sufficient validation of the environment configuration."
