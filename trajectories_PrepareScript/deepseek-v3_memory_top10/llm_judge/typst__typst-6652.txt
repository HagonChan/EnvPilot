"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed using `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast`. The output shows that multiple test suites ran across different crates in the workspace, with all tests either passing or being ignored as expected. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, meeting the first success criterion.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The environment was properly configured with all necessary dependencies (Rust 1.88.0, system libraries, etc.), and the core functionality was verified through the successful execution of the test suite. The ability to run the tests demonstrates that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally, meeting the second success criterion.\n\nThe agent successfully navigated through installation challenges (missing curl/wget, SSL issues) and ultimately achieved a fully functional environment where tests could run to completion. While some individual tests were ignored (as expected in doc-tests), the test framework executed fully and the core functionality was verified."
