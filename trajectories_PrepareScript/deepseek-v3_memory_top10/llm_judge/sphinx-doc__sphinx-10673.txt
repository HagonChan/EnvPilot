"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully configured the environment, installed dependencies, and ran the test suite. Although some tests failed, the test suite completed execution and generated a report, meeting the success criteria for Condition 1.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent verified that core modules could be imported and used normally. The main functional modules were operational, and basic API calls returned expected results, meeting the success criteria for Condition 2.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning:\n- **Condition 1**: The test suite executed to completion, with some tests passing and others failing. The failures were due to specific test case expectations (e.g., HTML markup mismatches) rather than environment configuration issues. The testing framework generated a complete report, indicating successful test suite execution.\n- **Condition 2**: The agent confirmed that core functionality was working by importing modules and running basic operations. The environment was correctly set up, and the project's main features were functional.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful as both conditions were met. The test failures were non-critical (specific test case issues) and did not prevent the test suite from completing or the core functionality from working."
