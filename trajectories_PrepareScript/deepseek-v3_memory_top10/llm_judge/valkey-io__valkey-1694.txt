"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed the test suite (`runtest` script) which completed without errors, generating a complete test report structure. The output showed \"All tests passed without errors!\" indicating the test suite ran to completion.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent also ran unit tests (`valkey-unit-tests`) which all passed, demonstrating that core functional modules can be imported and used normally. The successful execution of both integration tests and unit tests confirms basic API functionality.\n\nBoth success criteria were met - the test suite completed execution and core functionality was verified through multiple test types. The environment configuration was successful."
