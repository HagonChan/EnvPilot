"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully, with 5104 tests run. Although there was 1 failure and 413 tests were skipped, the test suite completed and generated a complete test report structure in `/testbed/target/surefire-reports`. This meets the success criteria for test suite execution.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality of the project was verified through the successful Maven build (`mvn clean install`) and the execution of the test suite. The main functional modules were imported and used normally, and the basic API calls returned expected results, as evidenced by the majority of tests passing. The single test failure was due to an environmental assumption (file permissions) rather than a fundamental issue with the core functionality.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful as both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) are met. The test failure is non-critical and does not indicate a fundamental problem with the environment setup."
