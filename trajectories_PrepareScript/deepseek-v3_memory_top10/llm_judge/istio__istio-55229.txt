"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The `go test ./...` command successfully executed multiple test suites across various packages in the repository. While there were a few failures (notably in the `istio-iptables` package), the majority of tests completed successfully and generated test reports. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria, as at least one complete test suite executed and finished successfully.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The environment was correctly configured with Go 1.23.0 (as specified in `go.mod`), build tools (`build-essential`), and all project dependencies (`go mod download`). The successful execution of most test suites demonstrates that core modules can be imported and used normally, meeting Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe few test failures observed are non-critical (specific test cases rather than framework or import failures) and do not invalidate the overall success of the environment configuration. The agent successfully installed all required dependencies and tools, and the test framework operated as expected."
