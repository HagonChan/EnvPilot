"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully with 3,534 passing tests and 48 pending tests. The test framework (Mocha) generated a complete test report structure, and the tests completed without critical failures. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project's core functionality was verified through the successful execution of the test suite. The main functional modules were imported and used normally, and the basic API calls returned expected results. This meets Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe environment configuration was successful as both conditions were met: the test suite completed execution, and the core functionality was verified. The agent successfully installed Node.js via `nvm`, resolved dependency conflicts, and ran the test suite to confirm the project's operability."
