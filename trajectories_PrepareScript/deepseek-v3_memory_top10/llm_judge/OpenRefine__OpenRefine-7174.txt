"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed the test suite for the OpenRefine project. The output shows a `BUILD SUCCESS` message, indicating that all test cases completed successfully across all modules (core, GREL, main, server, extensions, etc.). The test framework generated a complete test report structure, as evidenced by the Jacoco coverage reports and the detailed module-by-module test results.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent successfully built the project from source using the `./refine build` command, which compiled all components including core modules, extensions, and packaging. The build process completed without errors, confirming that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally. The successful test execution further verifies that basic API calls and core features are working as expected.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria:\n- At least one complete test suite executed and finished successfully\n- Core functionality was verified through successful build and test execution\n\nThe agent properly installed all required dependencies (JDK 11, Maven, Node.js 18) and resolved any version conflicts (Node.js upgrade). The build and test processes completed without critical errors, demonstrating a properly configured environment."
