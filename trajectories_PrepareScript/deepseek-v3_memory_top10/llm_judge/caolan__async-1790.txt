"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed the test suite using Mocha, with all 679 test cases passing. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, meeting the first success criterion.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent verified core functionality by installing dependencies and running the test suite, which implicitly tests the main functional modules. The successful test execution demonstrates that core modules can be imported and used normally, meeting the second success criterion.\n\nThe environment configuration was successful as both conditions were met: the test suite completed execution without critical failures, and core functionality was verified through test execution."
