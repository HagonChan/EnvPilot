"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite completed successfully with 1897 tests passed, 15 skipped, and 6 expected failures. The testing framework generated a complete test report structure, including coverage statistics. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules were imported and used normally during the test execution. Basic API calls returned expected results as evidenced by the high test pass rate. Core features were demonstrated through the extensive test suite execution. This meets Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe environment configuration was successful despite initial challenges with dependency versions. The agent systematically resolved version conflicts by:\n- Downgrading numpy to 1.23.5\n- Downgrading matplotlib to 3.6.0\n- Downgrading pandas to 1.5.3\n- Downgrading statsmodels to 0.13.2\n\nThe remaining warnings and skipped tests are non-critical and don't affect the core functionality. The agent successfully configured the environment to meet both success criteria."
