"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed using Pest, with all 541 tests passing. The testing framework generated a complete test report structure, confirming that the test suite completed successfully.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules were imported and used normally, as evidenced by the successful execution of the test suite. Basic API calls returned expected results, and core features were demonstrated through the test cases.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria, as the test suite completed successfully and core functionality was verified. The initial PHP version constraint (8.1) was adjusted to 8.2 to meet dependency requirements, which was necessary for the project to function correctly. All required PHP extensions were installed, and the test suite ran without critical errors."
