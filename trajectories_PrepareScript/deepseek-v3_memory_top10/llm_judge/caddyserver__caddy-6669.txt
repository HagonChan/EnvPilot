"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed with `go test ./...`. While there were some failures in the integration tests (`github.com/caddyserver/caddy/v2/caddytest/integration`), the majority of tests passed, and the test framework generated a complete test report structure. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria, as the test suite completed execution despite individual test failures.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project was successfully built from source using `go build`, and core modules were imported and used normally during the test execution. The main functional modules were operational, as evidenced by the successful execution of most test cases. This meets Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful because both conditions are satisfied: the test suite completed execution, and core functionality was verified. The presence of some test failures does not invalidate the success, as the criteria focus on framework operability rather than perfect test pass rates."
