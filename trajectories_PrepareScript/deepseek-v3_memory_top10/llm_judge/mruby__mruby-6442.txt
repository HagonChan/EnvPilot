"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully with `rake all test`. The output shows that 1610 tests passed, 0 failed, and 8 were skipped. The test framework generated a complete report structure, indicating that the test suite completed successfully.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The build process completed without errors, and the core functionality was verified through the execution of the test suite. The main functional modules were imported and used normally, as evidenced by the successful execution of the tests.\n\nBoth conditions for success are met: the test suite completed successfully, and the core functionality was verified. The skipped tests are non-critical and do not affect the overall success of the environment configuration."
