"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed multiple test suites (unit tests, integration tests, etc.) which completed without critical failures. The testing framework generated complete test reports, and all test suites finished execution as evidenced by the output showing \"test result: ok\" for various components like rocket, rocket_http, rocket_sync_db_pools, and rocket_ws.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules were successfully imported and used, as demonstrated by the successful build and test execution. Core features were verified through example code execution in the test cases, and basic API calls returned expected results. The project built successfully with default features, and all documented functionality was confirmed operational.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria despite initial build challenges (resolved by installing build-essential). The test suite completion and core functionality verification confirm the environment is correctly configured."
