"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite `cargo test --all` completed successfully with all 924 tests passing. The testing framework generated a complete test report structure, confirming that the test suite executed and finished without critical failures.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules can be imported and used normally. Basic API calls return expected results, and core features were demonstrated through example code execution. The Rust toolchain (version 1.77) and dependencies (`ripgrep`, `shellcheck`, `python3`) were correctly installed, enabling the project to build and test successfully.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning:\n- **Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution)**: The final test run showed all 924 tests passing, with 7 ignored tests (a normal configuration). The test suite completed execution, and the framework generated a structured report.\n- **Condition 2 (Core Functionality)**: The project built successfully, and core functionality was verified through test execution. The agent resolved issues like missing dependencies (`python3`, `build-essential`) and environment variables (`USER`), ensuring the project's operability.\n- **Failure Conditions Avoided**: No critical errors (e.g., import failures, test framework crashes) occurred. The agent stayed within call limits and achieved basic functionality."
