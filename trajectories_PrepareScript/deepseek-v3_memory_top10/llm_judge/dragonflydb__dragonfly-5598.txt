"FAILED\nDetailed Reasoning:\n1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**: The agent was unable to successfully execute any test suite. While the environment was configured with necessary dependencies (cmake, ninja, g++, etc.), the build process failed due to network issues preventing the download of critical dependencies like abseil-cpp, zstd, and mimalloc. This resulted in no test executables being generated, making it impossible to run any tests.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**: The agent couldn't verify core functionality because the build process didn't complete. Without successful compilation, there were no executable modules to import or test. The CMake configuration errors and missing dependencies prevented the project from reaching a state where core functionality could be demonstrated.\n\n3. **Failure Conditions Met**: The environment configuration failed because:\n   - No test suite could complete execution (all test binaries were missing)\n   - Core modules couldn't be built or imported\n   - The agent exhausted reasonable attempts to resolve dependency issues\n   - Network-related failures persisted despite multiple retries\n\n4. **Partial Successes**: The agent did successfully:\n   - Install all system-level dependencies\n   - Configure the CMake environment\n   - Partially resolve some dependency issues through manual intervention\n   - Follow proper debugging procedures when encountering failures\n\nThe task ultimately failed because the environment couldn't be fully configured to a state where either test execution or core functionality verification was possible, primarily due to unresolved network-related dependency issues."
