"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The build process completed successfully, and multiple test suites were executed. Although one test failed due to a timeout (`GradleKotlinExtensionsTests > gradle_wrapper(Path, OutputFiles)`), the majority of tests passed, and the test framework generated a complete test report structure. This meets the success criteria for test suite execution, as individual test failures are acceptable as long as the suite completes.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project's core modules were built successfully, and the main functional modules can be imported and used normally. The build process demonstrated that the core features are operational, and the project's basic functionality is intact. The isolated test failure does not indicate a fundamental issue with the core functionality.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful as both conditions are met: the test suite executed (with minor failures), and the core functionality is verified. The timeout issue in one test is non-critical and does not affect the overall success of the environment setup."
