"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully, with most tests passing. Although some tests were skipped (primarily GPU-related tests), this is expected due to the environment configuration (e.g., missing GPU support). The test framework generated a complete test report structure, and the suite completed execution.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The build process completed successfully, and the core functionality of the Halide project was verified through the execution of the test suite. The main functional modules were built and tested, demonstrating that the environment is correctly configured for the project's requirements.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria: the test suite executed successfully, and the core functionality was verified. The skipped tests do not affect the overall success, as they are related to optional features (e.g., GPU support) that were not part of the primary configuration goals."
