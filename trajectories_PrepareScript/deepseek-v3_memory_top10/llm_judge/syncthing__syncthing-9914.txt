"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed using `go run build.go test`. The output shows that multiple test packages were run, and all tests passed (indicated by `ok` status). This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project was successfully built from source using `go run build.go`, and the test suite execution demonstrates that the core functionality is working as expected. The test results indicate that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally, and basic API calls return expected results.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful as both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) are met. The agent successfully resolved dependency issues, installed the correct Go version, and ensured the project could be built and tested."
