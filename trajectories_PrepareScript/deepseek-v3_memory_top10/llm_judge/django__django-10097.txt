"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite (`./runtests.py`) was successfully executed, completing with a test report that includes failures, errors, and skipped tests. This meets the success criterion of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish, even if individual test cases fail.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core Django modules were successfully imported and used during the test execution, as evidenced by the test suite running and interacting with Django's core components. Basic API calls and core features were demonstrated through the test suite execution.\n\nThe environment was properly configured with all necessary system dependencies (`gcc`, `g++`, `cmake`, `make`, `libssl-dev`, `libyaml-dev`, `python3-pip`, and `tzdata`), and the project was installed from source in editable mode. The test suite ran to completion, indicating that the environment is correctly set up for development and testing. The remaining test failures are likely due to the specific state of the Django development version being tested and do not indicate a failure in environment configuration."
