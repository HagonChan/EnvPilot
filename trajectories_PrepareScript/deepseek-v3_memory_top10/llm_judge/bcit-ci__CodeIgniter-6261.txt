"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The PHPUnit test suite executed successfully, running 337 tests with 11 warnings and 24 skipped tests. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, including warnings about deprecated assertions. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The environment was properly configured with PHP and all required extensions, Composer was installed, and dependencies were successfully installed. The test execution demonstrates that the core functionality is operational, as evidenced by the large number of tests that ran successfully. This meets Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe warnings about deprecated assertions and skipped tests are non-critical issues that don't prevent the test suite from completing or the core functionality from working. The environment configuration is therefore considered successful."
