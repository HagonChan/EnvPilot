"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed using PHPUnit. Although there were some failures and warnings, the test suite completed its run, generating a complete test report structure. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully, even with individual test case failures.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules were imported and used normally. The core functionality was verified through the execution of the test suite, and basic API calls returned expected results. The environment was properly configured with PHP 8.1, necessary extensions, and Composer, allowing the project to function as intended.\n\nThe remaining test failures are non-critical and do not prevent the core functionality from working as expected. The environment configuration is considered successful as both primary conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) have been met."
