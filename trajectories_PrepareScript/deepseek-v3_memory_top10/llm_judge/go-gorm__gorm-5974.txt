"PASSED\n1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The test suite executed successfully with all tests passing (shown by \"ok\" status for each package). The output confirms the test framework generated a complete test report structure.\n2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The successful test execution implies the core functional modules can be imported and used normally. The agent also verified the Go installation and dependency management worked correctly before running tests.\n3. The agent properly followed the installation process for Go 1.21.0 as specified in the task requirements, resolved dependency issues, and successfully executed the test suite without modifying any test cases.\n4. Both success criteria were met: the test suite completed execution and core functionality was verified through successful test runs across all packages."
