"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed using PHPUnit. Although there were 2 errors and 4 failures out of 5805 tests, the test suite completed its execution and generated a detailed report. This meets the success criteria as the test framework was able to start, execute, and finish, producing a complete test report structure. Individual test case failures are acceptable as long as the suite completes.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality of the project was verified by successfully installing the project's dependencies using Composer and running the test suite. The main functional modules (Carbon library) can be imported and used normally, as evidenced by the test suite execution. Basic API calls and core features were demonstrated through the test cases, even though some tests failed.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful because both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) were met. The errors and failures encountered are related to specific test cases and do not indicate a fundamental break in the core functionality or test framework operability."
