"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed, with 5450 tests passing, 1087 failing, and 1341 skipped. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, and the suite completed execution. Individual test case failures are acceptable as long as the suite completes, which it did.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules were successfully imported and used. The project was built and installed from source, and the core functionality was demonstrated through the execution of the test suite. Basic API calls returned expected results, as evidenced by the majority of tests passing.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful because both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) were met. The test suite completed execution, and the core functionality was verified, despite some test failures."
