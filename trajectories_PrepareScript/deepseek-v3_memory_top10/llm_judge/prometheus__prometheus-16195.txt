"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The `make test` command successfully executed and completed, running all the Go tests and UI tests. The test suite generated a complete test report structure, and all tests passed. Although there were some linting warnings in the UI tests, these are non-critical and do not affect the test suite's completion or functionality.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project was successfully built from source using `make build`, and the main functional modules (e.g., `prometheus`, `promtool`) were compiled and can be imported/used normally. The core functionality was verified by the successful execution of the test suite, which includes basic API calls and feature tests. \n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria: the test suite completed successfully, and the core functionality is operational. The agent successfully installed all required dependencies (Go, Node.js, npm, system libraries) and resolved any conflicts (e.g., upgrading Go, removing conflicting Node.js packages). The project is now fully functional and testable."
