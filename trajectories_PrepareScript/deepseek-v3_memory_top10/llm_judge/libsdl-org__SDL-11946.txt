"FAILED\n1. The task was to configure a Go environment (version 1.21) and verify test execution, but the repository is actually a C project (SDL library) with no Go files or configuration.\n2. No Go test suite could be executed since the project doesn't contain any Go code or test files.\n3. Core Go functionality verification is impossible as there are no Go modules or packages to import and test.\n4. The repository contains C source files and uses CMake for building, which is completely different from the expected Go project structure.\n5. The agent correctly identified the mismatch between task requirements and actual repository contents, but couldn't proceed with the intended Go environment configuration."
