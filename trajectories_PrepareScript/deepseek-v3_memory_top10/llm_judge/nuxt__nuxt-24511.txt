"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite successfully started and executed, with most tests passing. Although one test (`test/hmr.test.ts > hmr > should work`) failed due to a timeout, the test framework generated a complete test report structure, and the majority of tests completed successfully. This meets the success criteria for Condition 1, as the test suite executed and finished, and individual test failures are acceptable as long as the suite completes.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality of the project was verified through the successful execution of multiple test cases. The main functional modules were imported and used normally, and basic API calls returned expected results. The build process also completed successfully, indicating that the core features are operational. This meets the success criteria for Condition 2.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning:\n- **Condition 1**: The test suite ran successfully for most tests, and the framework generated a detailed report. The failure of one test due to a timeout does not invalidate the overall success, as the suite completed execution.\n- **Condition 2**: The project's core functionality was demonstrated through successful test executions and builds. The ability to run the majority of tests and complete the build process confirms that the core modules are functional. \n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful as both conditions are met."
