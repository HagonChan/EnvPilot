"FAILED\n1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**: The test suite did not complete successfully. Multiple attempts to run tests via `tox` and directly via `pytest` failed due to various dependency issues (missing `setuptools.dep_util`, `hypothesis`, `erfa`). The final attempt to install from source also failed with a Python runtime error. No test suite completed execution.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**: Core functionality could not be verified because the package could not be properly installed from source due to the Python runtime error during installation. Basic imports and API calls were not tested because the package installation failed.\n\nThe environment configuration did not meet either of the two success criteria. While significant progress was made in setting up the environment and installing dependencies, fundamental issues prevented both test execution and core functionality verification. The root cause appears to be either an incompatibility in the Python environment or issues with the source code itself that prevented successful installation."
