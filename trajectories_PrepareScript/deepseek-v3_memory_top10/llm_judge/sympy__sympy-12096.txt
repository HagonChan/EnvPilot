"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite completed successfully after fixing several outdated imports (Mapping, Callable, Iterable, MutableMapping) and updating the time.clock reference. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, and while some individual tests failed initially, the suite completed execution after all necessary fixes were applied.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules can be imported and used normally. Basic API calls return expected results, and core features were demonstrated through example code execution in the test suite. The project was successfully installed from source, and all examples passed after the environment was properly configured.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria:\n- At least one complete test suite executed and finished successfully\n- Core functionality was verified through imports and example execution\n\nThe agent successfully resolved all compatibility issues with Python 3.10 by updating deprecated imports and maintaining the project's functionality. The test suite results confirm the environment is correctly configured for the repository."
