"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed using `npm test`. All 99 test suites passed with 1073 tests completed successfully. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, including coverage statistics.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules were imported and used normally. The core functionality was verified through the successful execution of all test cases, which cover the project's main features and API calls. The example code in the tests demonstrates that the core features are working as expected.\n\nBoth success criteria have been met:\n- At least one complete test suite executed and finished successfully (in fact, all test suites passed)\n- Core functionality was verified through test execution and coverage reports\n- The agent successfully configured the environment by installing Node.js, npm, and project dependencies\n- All tests passed without any critical failures"
