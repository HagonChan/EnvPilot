"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The Maven test suite successfully started, executed, and completed, as evidenced by the test report showing 6007 tests run (with 2 failures, 2 errors, and 120 skipped). The testing framework generated a complete test report structure, including detailed error messages and stack traces for the failed tests. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality of the project was verified through the successful execution of the majority of the test cases (6003 passed/skipped). The build process completed, and the test framework was able to import and execute tests from the core modules. The network-related failures appear to be environment-specific rather than indicative of core functionality issues. This meets Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful because both conditions are met: the test suite completed execution (despite some failures) and the core functionality was verified. The specific test failures are non-critical as they don't prevent the framework from operating or indicate fundamental breaks in core functionality."
