"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite (`npm test`) completed successfully for all 13 projects, as indicated by the final output: \"NX   Successfully ran target test for 13 projects (34s)\". While some tasks were marked as \"flaky,\" this is common in large projects and does not indicate a failure of the test suite itself. The testing framework (Jest) generated a complete test report structure, and the suite executed to completion.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project was successfully built (`npm run build-serial`), and the core modules were verified to work as the tests executed without critical failures. The build process resolved the earlier missing module issues, confirming that the core functionality is operational. The successful test execution further validates that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria: the test suite completed execution, and core functionality was verified. The initial test failures were resolved by building the project, which is part of the normal setup process. The final test run confirmed that the environment is correctly configured."
