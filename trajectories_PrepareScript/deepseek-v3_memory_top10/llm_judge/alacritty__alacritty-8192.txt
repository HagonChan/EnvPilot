"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully with all tests passing (127 passed in the main test suite and 44 in the reference tests). The testing framework generated a complete test report structure, and the test suite completed without any critical errors.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project was successfully built from source using `cargo build --release`, and the main functional modules were verified through the test suite execution. Core features were demonstrated through the test cases, and the project's basic functionality was confirmed to be working as expected.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria: the test suite completed successfully, and the core functionality was verified. The agent successfully installed all necessary dependencies (Rust toolchain, build-essential, libfontconfig1-dev, etc.) and resolved build issues to achieve a working environment."
