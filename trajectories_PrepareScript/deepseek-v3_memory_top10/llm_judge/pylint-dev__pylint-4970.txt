"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed, with 1378 tests passing, 66 skipped, and 200 deselected. Although there were 8 failures and 11 errors, the test suite completed its execution and generated a comprehensive test report. This meets the success criterion of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully, even with individual test case failures.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality of the project was verified as the main modules (`pylint` and `astroid`) were successfully imported and used during the test execution. The test suite's ability to run and produce results demonstrates that the core functional modules are operational.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful because both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) were met. The presence of some test failures does not invalidate the success, as the criteria focus on framework operability rather than test pass rates."
