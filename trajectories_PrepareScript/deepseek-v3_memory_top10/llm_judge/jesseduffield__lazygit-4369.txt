"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed the test suite (`make test`), which completed without errors. The output shows multiple test packages passing, including integration tests that took 7.916s to complete. This meets the success criterion of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully, even if some individual test files were marked as having no tests.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent built the project from source (`make build`) successfully after resolving dependency issues (Go version mismatch, missing vendor packages). The ability to build and run tests confirms that core modules can be imported and used normally, and basic functionality is operational (e.g., Git operations after configuring user details). The project's main functionality was demonstrated through the test execution.\n\n**Key Points**:\n- The environment was correctly configured with Go 1.22, build tools, and system dependencies.\n- The initial test failure due to Git configuration was resolved, and subsequent tests passed.\n- The project's build and test processes completed, confirming both framework operability and core functionality."
