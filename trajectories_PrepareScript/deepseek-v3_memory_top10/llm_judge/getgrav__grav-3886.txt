"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite ran successfully with all 208 unit tests passing. The output shows a complete test report structure with detailed results for each test case, confirming that the testing framework executed normally and completed without critical errors.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The environment was properly configured with PHP 8.1 and all required extensions (including `mbstring`, which was initially missing but installed later). The Composer dependencies were installed successfully, and the test suite execution demonstrates that core functionality is operational. The successful test run implies that main functional modules can be imported and used normally.\n\nBoth success criteria are fully met:\n- The test suite completed execution with a full report.\n- Core functionality is verified through the passing tests and successful dependency installation."
