"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: Both C++ and Java test suites were successfully executed. The C++ tests ran via specific binaries (`generate_geocoding_data_test` and `libphonenumber_test`), and the Java tests ran via Maven's `mvn test` command. All tests passed without failures.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules for both C++ and Java were successfully built and imported. The C++ project was built using CMake and Make, and the Java project was built using Maven. Core features were demonstrated through the execution of test cases, which verified the functionality of the libraries.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria, as the test suites completed successfully and the core functionality was verified."
