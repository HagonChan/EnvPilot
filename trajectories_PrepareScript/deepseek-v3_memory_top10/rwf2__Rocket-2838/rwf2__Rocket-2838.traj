Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: Cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n            **Case1**:\n                - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n                - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n                - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n            \n            **Case2**:\n                - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n                - Action: cargo test\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: The Rust project required a nightly toolchain for specific features in the rayon-demo package, but the environment only had the stable toolchain installed.\n                - Solution: The rayon-demo package used the unstable '#![feature(test)]' attribute, which is incompatible with the stable Rust toolchain. The root cause was a toolchain version mismatch in the environment configuration. The solution was to exclude the rayon-demo package from test execution to avoid compilation errors.\n                - Action: cargo test --workspace --exclude rayon-demo\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n                - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n                - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Existing Rust installation conflicted with rustup installation\n                - Solution: An existing Rust installation was detected at /usr/local/cargo/bin during rustup installation, causing a conflict as rustup requires being the primary Rust installation. The root cause was an incompatible pre-existing environment configuration. The solution was to force installation using the -y flag to override the conflict.\n                - Action: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n                - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n                - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n                - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: The cargo command failed due to missing shared library libgcc_s.so.1\n                - Solution: The GCC runtime library was not installed in the Alpine-based environment, which is required for executing Rust binaries. The root cause was an incomplete build environment setup. The solution was to install GCC using the Alpine package manager.\n                - Action: apk add gcc\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies failed to compile during Rust project testing.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools (e.g., gcc, make) were missing, causing native dependency compilation failures. The root cause was an incomplete build environment lacking development toolchains. The solution was to install the build-essential package to provide necessary compilation tools.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies were missing, causing failures when compiling Rust projects or installing tools like cross.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools and libraries (build-essential, pkg-config, libssl-dev, libclang-dev, cmake) are required for compiling Rust projects and their dependencies. The root cause was incomplete system packages in the environment. The solution was to install these packages to resolve compilation and installation errors.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libclang-dev cmake\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install the build-essential package to provide necessary compilation tools.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies were missing, causing failures when compiling Rust projects or installing tools like cross.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools and libraries (build-essential, pkg-config, libssl-dev, libclang-dev, cmake) are required for compiling Rust projects and their dependencies. The root cause was incomplete system packages in the environment. The solution was to install these packages to resolve compilation and installation errors.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libclang-dev cmake\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n                - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n            \n            **Case2**:\n                - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n                - Action: cargo test\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: The Rust project required a nightly toolchain for specific features in the rayon-demo package, but the environment only had the stable toolchain installed.\n                - Solution: The rayon-demo package used the unstable '#![feature(test)]' attribute, which is incompatible with the stable Rust toolchain. The root cause was a toolchain version mismatch in the environment configuration. The solution was to exclude the rayon-demo package from test execution to avoid compilation errors.\n                - Action: cargo test --workspace --exclude rayon-demo\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n                - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n                - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Existing Rust installation conflicted with rustup installation\n                - Solution: An existing Rust installation was detected at /usr/local/cargo/bin during rustup installation, causing a conflict as rustup requires being the primary Rust installation. The root cause was an incompatible pre-existing environment configuration. The solution was to force installation using the -y flag to override the conflict.\n                - Action: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n                - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n                - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n                - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: The cargo command failed due to missing shared library libgcc_s.so.1\n                - Solution: The GCC runtime library was not installed in the Alpine-based environment, which is required for executing Rust binaries. The root cause was an incomplete build environment setup. The solution was to install GCC using the Alpine package manager.\n                - Action: apk add gcc\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies failed to compile during Rust project testing.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools (e.g., gcc, make) were missing, causing native dependency compilation failures. The root cause was an incomplete build environment lacking development toolchains. The solution was to install the build-essential package to provide necessary compilation tools.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies were missing, causing failures when compiling Rust projects or installing tools like cross.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools and libraries (build-essential, pkg-config, libssl-dev, libclang-dev, cmake) are required for compiling Rust projects and their dependencies. The root cause was incomplete system packages in the environment. The solution was to install these packages to resolve compilation and installation errors.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libclang-dev cmake\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n                - Action: cargo test\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: The Rust project required a nightly toolchain for specific features in the rayon-demo package, but the environment only had the stable toolchain installed.\n                - Solution: The rayon-demo package used the unstable '#![feature(test)]' attribute, which is incompatible with the stable Rust toolchain. The root cause was a toolchain version mismatch in the environment configuration. The solution was to exclude the rayon-demo package from test execution to avoid compilation errors.\n                - Action: cargo test --workspace --exclude rayon-demo\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n                - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n                - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Existing Rust installation conflicted with rustup installation\n                - Solution: An existing Rust installation was detected at /usr/local/cargo/bin during rustup installation, causing a conflict as rustup requires being the primary Rust installation. The root cause was an incompatible pre-existing environment configuration. The solution was to force installation using the -y flag to override the conflict.\n                - Action: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n                - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n                - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n                - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: The cargo command failed due to missing shared library libgcc_s.so.1\n                - Solution: The GCC runtime library was not installed in the Alpine-based environment, which is required for executing Rust binaries. The root cause was an incomplete build environment setup. The solution was to install GCC using the Alpine package manager.\n                - Action: apk add gcc\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies failed to compile during Rust project testing.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools (e.g., gcc, make) were missing, causing native dependency compilation failures. The root cause was an incomplete build environment lacking development toolchains. The solution was to install the build-essential package to provide necessary compilation tools.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies were missing, causing failures when compiling Rust projects or installing tools like cross.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools and libraries (build-essential, pkg-config, libssl-dev, libclang-dev, cmake) are required for compiling Rust projects and their dependencies. The root cause was incomplete system packages in the environment. The solution was to install these packages to resolve compilation and installation errors.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libclang-dev cmake\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: Cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n            **Case1**:\n                - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n                - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n                - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n            \n            **Case2**:\n                - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n                - Action: cargo test\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: The Rust project required a nightly toolchain for specific features in the rayon-demo package, but the environment only had the stable toolchain installed.\n                - Solution: The rayon-demo package used the unstable '#![feature(test)]' attribute, which is incompatible with the stable Rust toolchain. The root cause was a toolchain version mismatch in the environment configuration. The solution was to exclude the rayon-demo package from test execution to avoid compilation errors.\n                - Action: cargo test --workspace --exclude rayon-demo\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n                - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n                - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Existing Rust installation conflicted with rustup installation\n                - Solution: An existing Rust installation was detected at /usr/local/cargo/bin during rustup installation, causing a conflict as rustup requires being the primary Rust installation. The root cause was an incompatible pre-existing environment configuration. The solution was to force installation using the -y flag to override the conflict.\n                - Action: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n                - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n                - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n                - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: The cargo command failed due to missing shared library libgcc_s.so.1\n                - Solution: The GCC runtime library was not installed in the Alpine-based environment, which is required for executing Rust binaries. The root cause was an incomplete build environment setup. The solution was to install GCC using the Alpine package manager.\n                - Action: apk add gcc\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies failed to compile during Rust project testing.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools (e.g., gcc, make) were missing, causing native dependency compilation failures. The root cause was an incomplete build environment lacking development toolchains. The solution was to install the build-essential package to provide necessary compilation tools.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies were missing, causing failures when compiling Rust projects or installing tools like cross.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools and libraries (build-essential, pkg-config, libssl-dev, libclang-dev, cmake) are required for compiling Rust projects and their dependencies. The root cause was incomplete system packages in the environment. The solution was to install these packages to resolve compilation and installation errors.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libclang-dev cmake\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: Cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n            **Case1**:\n                - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n                - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n                - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n            \n            **Case2**:\n                - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n                - Action: cargo test\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: The Rust project required a nightly toolchain for specific features in the rayon-demo package, but the environment only had the stable toolchain installed.\n                - Solution: The rayon-demo package used the unstable '#![feature(test)]' attribute, which is incompatible with the stable Rust toolchain. The root cause was a toolchain version mismatch in the environment configuration. The solution was to exclude the rayon-demo package from test execution to avoid compilation errors.\n                - Action: cargo test --workspace --exclude rayon-demo\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n                - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n                - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Existing Rust installation conflicted with rustup installation\n                - Solution: An existing Rust installation was detected at /usr/local/cargo/bin during rustup installation, causing a conflict as rustup requires being the primary Rust installation. The root cause was an incompatible pre-existing environment configuration. The solution was to force installation using the -y flag to override the conflict.\n                - Action: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n                - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n                - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n                - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: The cargo command failed due to missing shared library libgcc_s.so.1\n                - Solution: The GCC runtime library was not installed in the Alpine-based environment, which is required for executing Rust binaries. The root cause was an incomplete build environment setup. The solution was to install GCC using the Alpine package manager.\n                - Action: apk add gcc\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies failed to compile during Rust project testing.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools (e.g., gcc, make) were missing, causing native dependency compilation failures. The root cause was an incomplete build environment lacking development toolchains. The solution was to install the build-essential package to provide necessary compilation tools.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies were missing, causing failures when compiling Rust projects or installing tools like cross.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools and libraries (build-essential, pkg-config, libssl-dev, libclang-dev, cmake) are required for compiling Rust projects and their dependencies. The root cause was incomplete system packages in the environment. The solution was to install these packages to resolve compilation and installation errors.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libclang-dev cmake\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: Cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n            **Case1**:\n                - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n                - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n                - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n            \n            **Case2**:\n                - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n                - Action: cargo test\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: The Rust project required a nightly toolchain for specific features in the rayon-demo package, but the environment only had the stable toolchain installed.\n                - Solution: The rayon-demo package used the unstable '#![feature(test)]' attribute, which is incompatible with the stable Rust toolchain. The root cause was a toolchain version mismatch in the environment configuration. The solution was to exclude the rayon-demo package from test execution to avoid compilation errors.\n                - Action: cargo test --workspace --exclude rayon-demo\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n                - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n                - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Existing Rust installation conflicted with rustup installation\n                - Solution: An existing Rust installation was detected at /usr/local/cargo/bin during rustup installation, causing a conflict as rustup requires being the primary Rust installation. The root cause was an incompatible pre-existing environment configuration. The solution was to force installation using the -y flag to override the conflict.\n                - Action: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n                - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n                - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n                - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: The cargo command failed due to missing shared library libgcc_s.so.1\n                - Solution: The GCC runtime library was not installed in the Alpine-based environment, which is required for executing Rust binaries. The root cause was an incomplete build environment setup. The solution was to install GCC using the Alpine package manager.\n                - Action: apk add gcc\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies failed to compile during Rust project testing.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools (e.g., gcc, make) were missing, causing native dependency compilation failures. The root cause was an incomplete build environment lacking development toolchains. The solution was to install the build-essential package to provide necessary compilation tools.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies were missing, causing failures when compiling Rust projects or installing tools like cross.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools and libraries (build-essential, pkg-config, libssl-dev, libclang-dev, cmake) are required for compiling Rust projects and their dependencies. The root cause was incomplete system packages in the environment. The solution was to install these packages to resolve compilation and installation errors.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libclang-dev cmake\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: Cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n            **Case1**:\n                - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n                - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n                - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n            \n            **Case2**:\n                - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n                - Action: cargo test\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: The Rust project required a nightly toolchain for specific features in the rayon-demo package, but the environment only had the stable toolchain installed.\n                - Solution: The rayon-demo package used the unstable '#![feature(test)]' attribute, which is incompatible with the stable Rust toolchain. The root cause was a toolchain version mismatch in the environment configuration. The solution was to exclude the rayon-demo package from test execution to avoid compilation errors.\n                - Action: cargo test --workspace --exclude rayon-demo\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n                - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n                - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Existing Rust installation conflicted with rustup installation\n                - Solution: An existing Rust installation was detected at /usr/local/cargo/bin during rustup installation, causing a conflict as rustup requires being the primary Rust installation. The root cause was an incompatible pre-existing environment configuration. The solution was to force installation using the -y flag to override the conflict.\n                - Action: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n                - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n                - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n                - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: The cargo command failed due to missing shared library libgcc_s.so.1\n                - Solution: The GCC runtime library was not installed in the Alpine-based environment, which is required for executing Rust binaries. The root cause was an incomplete build environment setup. The solution was to install GCC using the Alpine package manager.\n                - Action: apk add gcc\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies failed to compile during Rust project testing.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools (e.g., gcc, make) were missing, causing native dependency compilation failures. The root cause was an incomplete build environment lacking development toolchains. The solution was to install the build-essential package to provide necessary compilation tools.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies were missing, causing failures when compiling Rust projects or installing tools like cross.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools and libraries (build-essential, pkg-config, libssl-dev, libclang-dev, cmake) are required for compiling Rust projects and their dependencies. The root cause was incomplete system packages in the environment. The solution was to install these packages to resolve compilation and installation errors.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libclang-dev cmake\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: Cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n            **Case1**:\n                - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n                - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n                - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n            \n            **Case2**:\n                - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n                - Action: cargo test\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: The Rust project required a nightly toolchain for specific features in the rayon-demo package, but the environment only had the stable toolchain installed.\n                - Solution: The rayon-demo package used the unstable '#![feature(test)]' attribute, which is incompatible with the stable Rust toolchain. The root cause was a toolchain version mismatch in the environment configuration. The solution was to exclude the rayon-demo package from test execution to avoid compilation errors.\n                - Action: cargo test --workspace --exclude rayon-demo\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n                - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n                - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Existing Rust installation conflicted with rustup installation\n                - Solution: An existing Rust installation was detected at /usr/local/cargo/bin during rustup installation, causing a conflict as rustup requires being the primary Rust installation. The root cause was an incompatible pre-existing environment configuration. The solution was to force installation using the -y flag to override the conflict.\n                - Action: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n                - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n                - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n                - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: The cargo command failed due to missing shared library libgcc_s.so.1\n                - Solution: The GCC runtime library was not installed in the Alpine-based environment, which is required for executing Rust binaries. The root cause was an incomplete build environment setup. The solution was to install GCC using the Alpine package manager.\n                - Action: apk add gcc\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies failed to compile during Rust project testing.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools (e.g., gcc, make) were missing, causing native dependency compilation failures. The root cause was an incomplete build environment lacking development toolchains. The solution was to install the build-essential package to provide necessary compilation tools.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies were missing, causing failures when compiling Rust projects or installing tools like cross.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools and libraries (build-essential, pkg-config, libssl-dev, libclang-dev, cmake) are required for compiling Rust projects and their dependencies. The root cause was incomplete system packages in the environment. The solution was to install these packages to resolve compilation and installation errors.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libclang-dev cmake\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: Cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n            **Case1**:\n                - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n                - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n                - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n            \n            **Case2**:\n                - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n                - Action: cargo test\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: The Rust project required a nightly toolchain for specific features in the rayon-demo package, but the environment only had the stable toolchain installed.\n                - Solution: The rayon-demo package used the unstable '#![feature(test)]' attribute, which is incompatible with the stable Rust toolchain. The root cause was a toolchain version mismatch in the environment configuration. The solution was to exclude the rayon-demo package from test execution to avoid compilation errors.\n                - Action: cargo test --workspace --exclude rayon-demo\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n                - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n                - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Existing Rust installation conflicted with rustup installation\n                - Solution: An existing Rust installation was detected at /usr/local/cargo/bin during rustup installation, causing a conflict as rustup requires being the primary Rust installation. The root cause was an incompatible pre-existing environment configuration. The solution was to force installation using the -y flag to override the conflict.\n                - Action: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n                - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n                - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n                - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: The cargo command failed due to missing shared library libgcc_s.so.1\n                - Solution: The GCC runtime library was not installed in the Alpine-based environment, which is required for executing Rust binaries. The root cause was an incomplete build environment setup. The solution was to install GCC using the Alpine package manager.\n                - Action: apk add gcc\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies failed to compile during Rust project testing.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools (e.g., gcc, make) were missing, causing native dependency compilation failures. The root cause was an incomplete build environment lacking development toolchains. The solution was to install the build-essential package to provide necessary compilation tools.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies were missing, causing failures when compiling Rust projects or installing tools like cross.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools and libraries (build-essential, pkg-config, libssl-dev, libclang-dev, cmake) are required for compiling Rust projects and their dependencies. The root cause was incomplete system packages in the environment. The solution was to install these packages to resolve compilation and installation errors.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libclang-dev cmake\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: Cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n            **Case1**:\n                - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n                - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n                - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n            \n            **Case2**:\n                - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n                - Action: cargo test\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: The Rust project required a nightly toolchain for specific features in the rayon-demo package, but the environment only had the stable toolchain installed.\n                - Solution: The rayon-demo package used the unstable '#![feature(test)]' attribute, which is incompatible with the stable Rust toolchain. The root cause was a toolchain version mismatch in the environment configuration. The solution was to exclude the rayon-demo package from test execution to avoid compilation errors.\n                - Action: cargo test --workspace --exclude rayon-demo\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n                - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n                - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Existing Rust installation conflicted with rustup installation\n                - Solution: An existing Rust installation was detected at /usr/local/cargo/bin during rustup installation, causing a conflict as rustup requires being the primary Rust installation. The root cause was an incompatible pre-existing environment configuration. The solution was to force installation using the -y flag to override the conflict.\n                - Action: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n                - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n                - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n                - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: The cargo command failed due to missing shared library libgcc_s.so.1\n                - Solution: The GCC runtime library was not installed in the Alpine-based environment, which is required for executing Rust binaries. The root cause was an incomplete build environment setup. The solution was to install GCC using the Alpine package manager.\n                - Action: apk add gcc\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies failed to compile during Rust project testing.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools (e.g., gcc, make) were missing, causing native dependency compilation failures. The root cause was an incomplete build environment lacking development toolchains. The solution was to install the build-essential package to provide necessary compilation tools.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies were missing, causing failures when compiling Rust projects or installing tools like cross.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools and libraries (build-essential, pkg-config, libssl-dev, libclang-dev, cmake) are required for compiling Rust projects and their dependencies. The root cause was incomplete system packages in the environment. The solution was to install these packages to resolve compilation and installation errors.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libclang-dev cmake\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: Cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n            **Case1**:\n                - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n                - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n                - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n            \n            **Case2**:\n                - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n                - Action: cargo test\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: The Rust project required a nightly toolchain for specific features in the rayon-demo package, but the environment only had the stable toolchain installed.\n                - Solution: The rayon-demo package used the unstable '#![feature(test)]' attribute, which is incompatible with the stable Rust toolchain. The root cause was a toolchain version mismatch in the environment configuration. The solution was to exclude the rayon-demo package from test execution to avoid compilation errors.\n                - Action: cargo test --workspace --exclude rayon-demo\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n                - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n                - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Existing Rust installation conflicted with rustup installation\n                - Solution: An existing Rust installation was detected at /usr/local/cargo/bin during rustup installation, causing a conflict as rustup requires being the primary Rust installation. The root cause was an incompatible pre-existing environment configuration. The solution was to force installation using the -y flag to override the conflict.\n                - Action: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n                - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n                - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n                - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: The cargo command failed due to missing shared library libgcc_s.so.1\n                - Solution: The GCC runtime library was not installed in the Alpine-based environment, which is required for executing Rust binaries. The root cause was an incomplete build environment setup. The solution was to install GCC using the Alpine package manager.\n                - Action: apk add gcc\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies failed to compile during Rust project testing.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools (e.g., gcc, make) were missing, causing native dependency compilation failures. The root cause was an incomplete build environment lacking development toolchains. The solution was to install the build-essential package to provide necessary compilation tools.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies were missing, causing failures when compiling Rust projects or installing tools like cross.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools and libraries (build-essential, pkg-config, libssl-dev, libclang-dev, cmake) are required for compiling Rust projects and their dependencies. The root cause was incomplete system packages in the environment. The solution was to install these packages to resolve compilation and installation errors.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libclang-dev cmake\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: Cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n            **Case1**:\n                - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n                - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n                - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n            \n            **Case2**:\n                - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n                - Action: cargo test\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: The Rust project required a nightly toolchain for specific features in the rayon-demo package, but the environment only had the stable toolchain installed.\n                - Solution: The rayon-demo package used the unstable '#![feature(test)]' attribute, which is incompatible with the stable Rust toolchain. The root cause was a toolchain version mismatch in the environment configuration. The solution was to exclude the rayon-demo package from test execution to avoid compilation errors.\n                - Action: cargo test --workspace --exclude rayon-demo\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n                - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n                - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Existing Rust installation conflicted with rustup installation\n                - Solution: An existing Rust installation was detected at /usr/local/cargo/bin during rustup installation, causing a conflict as rustup requires being the primary Rust installation. The root cause was an incompatible pre-existing environment configuration. The solution was to force installation using the -y flag to override the conflict.\n                - Action: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n                - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n                - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n                - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: The cargo command failed due to missing shared library libgcc_s.so.1\n                - Solution: The GCC runtime library was not installed in the Alpine-based environment, which is required for executing Rust binaries. The root cause was an incomplete build environment setup. The solution was to install GCC using the Alpine package manager.\n                - Action: apk add gcc\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies failed to compile during Rust project testing.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools (e.g., gcc, make) were missing, causing native dependency compilation failures. The root cause was an incomplete build environment lacking development toolchains. The solution was to install the build-essential package to provide necessary compilation tools.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies were missing, causing failures when compiling Rust projects or installing tools like cross.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools and libraries (build-essential, pkg-config, libssl-dev, libclang-dev, cmake) are required for compiling Rust projects and their dependencies. The root cause was incomplete system packages in the environment. The solution was to install these packages to resolve compilation and installation errors.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libclang-dev cmake\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: Cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n            **Case1**:\n                - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n                - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n                - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n            \n            **Case2**:\n                - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n                - Action: cargo test\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: The Rust project required a nightly toolchain for specific features in the rayon-demo package, but the environment only had the stable toolchain installed.\n                - Solution: The rayon-demo package used the unstable '#![feature(test)]' attribute, which is incompatible with the stable Rust toolchain. The root cause was a toolchain version mismatch in the environment configuration. The solution was to exclude the rayon-demo package from test execution to avoid compilation errors.\n                - Action: cargo test --workspace --exclude rayon-demo\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n                - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n                - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Existing Rust installation conflicted with rustup installation\n                - Solution: An existing Rust installation was detected at /usr/local/cargo/bin during rustup installation, causing a conflict as rustup requires being the primary Rust installation. The root cause was an incompatible pre-existing environment configuration. The solution was to force installation using the -y flag to override the conflict.\n                - Action: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n                - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n                - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n                - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: The cargo command failed due to missing shared library libgcc_s.so.1\n                - Solution: The GCC runtime library was not installed in the Alpine-based environment, which is required for executing Rust binaries. The root cause was an incomplete build environment setup. The solution was to install GCC using the Alpine package manager.\n                - Action: apk add gcc\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies failed to compile during Rust project testing.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools (e.g., gcc, make) were missing, causing native dependency compilation failures. The root cause was an incomplete build environment lacking development toolchains. The solution was to install the build-essential package to provide necessary compilation tools.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies were missing, causing failures when compiling Rust projects or installing tools like cross.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools and libraries (build-essential, pkg-config, libssl-dev, libclang-dev, cmake) are required for compiling Rust projects and their dependencies. The root cause was incomplete system packages in the environment. The solution was to install these packages to resolve compilation and installation errors.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libclang-dev cmake\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: Cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n            **Case1**:\n                - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n                - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n                - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n            \n            **Case2**:\n                - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n                - Action: cargo test\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: The Rust project required a nightly toolchain for specific features in the rayon-demo package, but the environment only had the stable toolchain installed.\n                - Solution: The rayon-demo package used the unstable '#![feature(test)]' attribute, which is incompatible with the stable Rust toolchain. The root cause was a toolchain version mismatch in the environment configuration. The solution was to exclude the rayon-demo package from test execution to avoid compilation errors.\n                - Action: cargo test --workspace --exclude rayon-demo\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n                - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n                - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Existing Rust installation conflicted with rustup installation\n                - Solution: An existing Rust installation was detected at /usr/local/cargo/bin during rustup installation, causing a conflict as rustup requires being the primary Rust installation. The root cause was an incompatible pre-existing environment configuration. The solution was to force installation using the -y flag to override the conflict.\n                - Action: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n                - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n                - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n                - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: The cargo command failed due to missing shared library libgcc_s.so.1\n                - Solution: The GCC runtime library was not installed in the Alpine-based environment, which is required for executing Rust binaries. The root cause was an incomplete build environment setup. The solution was to install GCC using the Alpine package manager.\n                - Action: apk add gcc\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies failed to compile during Rust project testing.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools (e.g., gcc, make) were missing, causing native dependency compilation failures. The root cause was an incomplete build environment lacking development toolchains. The solution was to install the build-essential package to provide necessary compilation tools.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies were missing, causing failures when compiling Rust projects or installing tools like cross.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools and libraries (build-essential, pkg-config, libssl-dev, libclang-dev, cmake) are required for compiling Rust projects and their dependencies. The root cause was incomplete system packages in the environment. The solution was to install these packages to resolve compilation and installation errors.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libclang-dev cmake\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: Cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n            **Case1**:\n                - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n                - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n                - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n            \n            **Case2**:\n                - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n                - Action: cargo test\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: The Rust project required a nightly toolchain for specific features in the rayon-demo package, but the environment only had the stable toolchain installed.\n                - Solution: The rayon-demo package used the unstable '#![feature(test)]' attribute, which is incompatible with the stable Rust toolchain. The root cause was a toolchain version mismatch in the environment configuration. The solution was to exclude the rayon-demo package from test execution to avoid compilation errors.\n                - Action: cargo test --workspace --exclude rayon-demo\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n                - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n                - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Existing Rust installation conflicted with rustup installation\n                - Solution: An existing Rust installation was detected at /usr/local/cargo/bin during rustup installation, causing a conflict as rustup requires being the primary Rust installation. The root cause was an incompatible pre-existing environment configuration. The solution was to force installation using the -y flag to override the conflict.\n                - Action: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n                - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n                - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n                - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: The cargo command failed due to missing shared library libgcc_s.so.1\n                - Solution: The GCC runtime library was not installed in the Alpine-based environment, which is required for executing Rust binaries. The root cause was an incomplete build environment setup. The solution was to install GCC using the Alpine package manager.\n                - Action: apk add gcc\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies failed to compile during Rust project testing.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools (e.g., gcc, make) were missing, causing native dependency compilation failures. The root cause was an incomplete build environment lacking development toolchains. The solution was to install the build-essential package to provide necessary compilation tools.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies were missing, causing failures when compiling Rust projects or installing tools like cross.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools and libraries (build-essential, pkg-config, libssl-dev, libclang-dev, cmake) are required for compiling Rust projects and their dependencies. The root cause was incomplete system packages in the environment. The solution was to install these packages to resolve compilation and installation errors.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libclang-dev cmake\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: Cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n            **Case1**:\n                - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n                - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n                - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n            \n            **Case2**:\n                - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n                - Action: cargo test\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: The Rust project required a nightly toolchain for specific features in the rayon-demo package, but the environment only had the stable toolchain installed.\n                - Solution: The rayon-demo package used the unstable '#![feature(test)]' attribute, which is incompatible with the stable Rust toolchain. The root cause was a toolchain version mismatch in the environment configuration. The solution was to exclude the rayon-demo package from test execution to avoid compilation errors.\n                - Action: cargo test --workspace --exclude rayon-demo\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n                - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n                - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Existing Rust installation conflicted with rustup installation\n                - Solution: An existing Rust installation was detected at /usr/local/cargo/bin during rustup installation, causing a conflict as rustup requires being the primary Rust installation. The root cause was an incompatible pre-existing environment configuration. The solution was to force installation using the -y flag to override the conflict.\n                - Action: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n                - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n                - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n                - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: The cargo command failed due to missing shared library libgcc_s.so.1\n                - Solution: The GCC runtime library was not installed in the Alpine-based environment, which is required for executing Rust binaries. The root cause was an incomplete build environment setup. The solution was to install GCC using the Alpine package manager.\n                - Action: apk add gcc\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies failed to compile during Rust project testing.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools (e.g., gcc, make) were missing, causing native dependency compilation failures. The root cause was an incomplete build environment lacking development toolchains. The solution was to install the build-essential package to provide necessary compilation tools.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies were missing, causing failures when compiling Rust projects or installing tools like cross.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools and libraries (build-essential, pkg-config, libssl-dev, libclang-dev, cmake) are required for compiling Rust projects and their dependencies. The root cause was incomplete system packages in the environment. The solution was to install these packages to resolve compilation and installation errors.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libclang-dev cmake\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n                - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n            \n            **Case2**:\n                - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n                - Action: cargo test\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: The Rust project required a nightly toolchain for specific features in the rayon-demo package, but the environment only had the stable toolchain installed.\n                - Solution: The rayon-demo package used the unstable '#![feature(test)]' attribute, which is incompatible with the stable Rust toolchain. The root cause was a toolchain version mismatch in the environment configuration. The solution was to exclude the rayon-demo package from test execution to avoid compilation errors.\n                - Action: cargo test --workspace --exclude rayon-demo\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n                - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n                - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Existing Rust installation conflicted with rustup installation\n                - Solution: An existing Rust installation was detected at /usr/local/cargo/bin during rustup installation, causing a conflict as rustup requires being the primary Rust installation. The root cause was an incompatible pre-existing environment configuration. The solution was to force installation using the -y flag to override the conflict.\n                - Action: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n                - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n                - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n                - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: The cargo command failed due to missing shared library libgcc_s.so.1\n                - Solution: The GCC runtime library was not installed in the Alpine-based environment, which is required for executing Rust binaries. The root cause was an incomplete build environment setup. The solution was to install GCC using the Alpine package manager.\n                - Action: apk add gcc\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies failed to compile during Rust project testing.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools (e.g., gcc, make) were missing, causing native dependency compilation failures. The root cause was an incomplete build environment lacking development toolchains. The solution was to install the build-essential package to provide necessary compilation tools.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies were missing, causing failures when compiling Rust projects or installing tools like cross.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools and libraries (build-essential, pkg-config, libssl-dev, libclang-dev, cmake) are required for compiling Rust projects and their dependencies. The root cause was incomplete system packages in the environment. The solution was to install these packages to resolve compilation and installation errors.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libclang-dev cmake\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n                - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n            \n            **Case2**:\n                - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n                - Action: cargo test\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: The Rust project required a nightly toolchain for specific features in the rayon-demo package, but the environment only had the stable toolchain installed.\n                - Solution: The rayon-demo package used the unstable '#![feature(test)]' attribute, which is incompatible with the stable Rust toolchain. The root cause was a toolchain version mismatch in the environment configuration. The solution was to exclude the rayon-demo package from test execution to avoid compilation errors.\n                - Action: cargo test --workspace --exclude rayon-demo\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n                - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n                - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Existing Rust installation conflicted with rustup installation\n                - Solution: An existing Rust installation was detected at /usr/local/cargo/bin during rustup installation, causing a conflict as rustup requires being the primary Rust installation. The root cause was an incompatible pre-existing environment configuration. The solution was to force installation using the -y flag to override the conflict.\n                - Action: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n                - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n                - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n                - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: The cargo command failed due to missing shared library libgcc_s.so.1\n                - Solution: The GCC runtime library was not installed in the Alpine-based environment, which is required for executing Rust binaries. The root cause was an incomplete build environment setup. The solution was to install GCC using the Alpine package manager.\n                - Action: apk add gcc\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies failed to compile during Rust project testing.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools (e.g., gcc, make) were missing, causing native dependency compilation failures. The root cause was an incomplete build environment lacking development toolchains. The solution was to install the build-essential package to provide necessary compilation tools.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies were missing, causing failures when compiling Rust projects or installing tools like cross.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools and libraries (build-essential, pkg-config, libssl-dev, libclang-dev, cmake) are required for compiling Rust projects and their dependencies. The root cause was incomplete system packages in the environment. The solution was to install these packages to resolve compilation and installation errors.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libclang-dev cmake\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: Cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n            **Case1**:\n                - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n                - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n                - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n            \n            **Case2**:\n                - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n                - Action: cargo test\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: The Rust project required a nightly toolchain for specific features in the rayon-demo package, but the environment only had the stable toolchain installed.\n                - Solution: The rayon-demo package used the unstable '#![feature(test)]' attribute, which is incompatible with the stable Rust toolchain. The root cause was a toolchain version mismatch in the environment configuration. The solution was to exclude the rayon-demo package from test execution to avoid compilation errors.\n                - Action: cargo test --workspace --exclude rayon-demo\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n                - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n                - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Existing Rust installation conflicted with rustup installation\n                - Solution: An existing Rust installation was detected at /usr/local/cargo/bin during rustup installation, causing a conflict as rustup requires being the primary Rust installation. The root cause was an incompatible pre-existing environment configuration. The solution was to force installation using the -y flag to override the conflict.\n                - Action: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n                - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n                - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n                - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: The cargo command failed due to missing shared library libgcc_s.so.1\n                - Solution: The GCC runtime library was not installed in the Alpine-based environment, which is required for executing Rust binaries. The root cause was an incomplete build environment setup. The solution was to install GCC using the Alpine package manager.\n                - Action: apk add gcc\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies failed to compile during Rust project testing.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools (e.g., gcc, make) were missing, causing native dependency compilation failures. The root cause was an incomplete build environment lacking development toolchains. The solution was to install the build-essential package to provide necessary compilation tools.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies were missing, causing failures when compiling Rust projects or installing tools like cross.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools and libraries (build-essential, pkg-config, libssl-dev, libclang-dev, cmake) are required for compiling Rust projects and their dependencies. The root cause was incomplete system packages in the environment. The solution was to install these packages to resolve compilation and installation errors.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libclang-dev cmake\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: Cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n            **Case1**:\n                - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n                - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n                - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n            \n            **Case2**:\n                - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n                - Action: cargo test\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: The Rust project required a nightly toolchain for specific features in the rayon-demo package, but the environment only had the stable toolchain installed.\n                - Solution: The rayon-demo package used the unstable '#![feature(test)]' attribute, which is incompatible with the stable Rust toolchain. The root cause was a toolchain version mismatch in the environment configuration. The solution was to exclude the rayon-demo package from test execution to avoid compilation errors.\n                - Action: cargo test --workspace --exclude rayon-demo\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n                - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n                - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Existing Rust installation conflicted with rustup installation\n                - Solution: An existing Rust installation was detected at /usr/local/cargo/bin during rustup installation, causing a conflict as rustup requires being the primary Rust installation. The root cause was an incompatible pre-existing environment configuration. The solution was to force installation using the -y flag to override the conflict.\n                - Action: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n                - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n                - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n                - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: The cargo command failed due to missing shared library libgcc_s.so.1\n                - Solution: The GCC runtime library was not installed in the Alpine-based environment, which is required for executing Rust binaries. The root cause was an incomplete build environment setup. The solution was to install GCC using the Alpine package manager.\n                - Action: apk add gcc\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies failed to compile during Rust project testing.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools (e.g., gcc, make) were missing, causing native dependency compilation failures. The root cause was an incomplete build environment lacking development toolchains. The solution was to install the build-essential package to provide necessary compilation tools.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies were missing, causing failures when compiling Rust projects or installing tools like cross.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools and libraries (build-essential, pkg-config, libssl-dev, libclang-dev, cmake) are required for compiling Rust projects and their dependencies. The root cause was incomplete system packages in the environment. The solution was to install these packages to resolve compilation and installation errors.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libclang-dev cmake\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: Cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n            **Case1**:\n                - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n                - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n                - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n            \n            **Case2**:\n                - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n                - Action: cargo test\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: The Rust project required a nightly toolchain for specific features in the rayon-demo package, but the environment only had the stable toolchain installed.\n                - Solution: The rayon-demo package used the unstable '#![feature(test)]' attribute, which is incompatible with the stable Rust toolchain. The root cause was a toolchain version mismatch in the environment configuration. The solution was to exclude the rayon-demo package from test execution to avoid compilation errors.\n                - Action: cargo test --workspace --exclude rayon-demo\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n                - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n                - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Existing Rust installation conflicted with rustup installation\n                - Solution: An existing Rust installation was detected at /usr/local/cargo/bin during rustup installation, causing a conflict as rustup requires being the primary Rust installation. The root cause was an incompatible pre-existing environment configuration. The solution was to force installation using the -y flag to override the conflict.\n                - Action: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n                - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n                - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n                - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: The cargo command failed due to missing shared library libgcc_s.so.1\n                - Solution: The GCC runtime library was not installed in the Alpine-based environment, which is required for executing Rust binaries. The root cause was an incomplete build environment setup. The solution was to install GCC using the Alpine package manager.\n                - Action: apk add gcc\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies failed to compile during Rust project testing.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools (e.g., gcc, make) were missing, causing native dependency compilation failures. The root cause was an incomplete build environment lacking development toolchains. The solution was to install the build-essential package to provide necessary compilation tools.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies were missing, causing failures when compiling Rust projects or installing tools like cross.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools and libraries (build-essential, pkg-config, libssl-dev, libclang-dev, cmake) are required for compiling Rust projects and their dependencies. The root cause was incomplete system packages in the environment. The solution was to install these packages to resolve compilation and installation errors.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libclang-dev cmake\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: Cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n            **Case1**:\n                - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n                - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n                - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n            \n            **Case2**:\n                - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n                - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n                - Action: cargo test\n            \n            **Case3**:\n                - Problem: The Rust project required a nightly toolchain for specific features in the rayon-demo package, but the environment only had the stable toolchain installed.\n                - Solution: The rayon-demo package used the unstable '#![feature(test)]' attribute, which is incompatible with the stable Rust toolchain. The root cause was a toolchain version mismatch in the environment configuration. The solution was to exclude the rayon-demo package from test execution to avoid compilation errors.\n                - Action: cargo test --workspace --exclude rayon-demo\n            \n            **Case4**:\n                - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n                - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n                - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n            \n            **Case5**:\n                - Problem: Existing Rust installation conflicted with rustup installation\n                - Solution: An existing Rust installation was detected at /usr/local/cargo/bin during rustup installation, causing a conflict as rustup requires being the primary Rust installation. The root cause was an incompatible pre-existing environment configuration. The solution was to force installation using the -y flag to override the conflict.\n                - Action: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case6**:\n                - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n                - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n            \n            **Case7**:\n                - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n                - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n                - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n            \n            **Case8**:\n                - Problem: The cargo command failed due to missing shared library libgcc_s.so.1\n                - Solution: The GCC runtime library was not installed in the Alpine-based environment, which is required for executing Rust binaries. The root cause was an incomplete build environment setup. The solution was to install GCC using the Alpine package manager.\n                - Action: apk add gcc\n            \n            **Case9**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies failed to compile during Rust project testing.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools (e.g., gcc, make) were missing, causing native dependency compilation failures. The root cause was an incomplete build environment lacking development toolchains. The solution was to install the build-essential package to provide necessary compilation tools.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n            \n            **Case10**:\n                - Problem: Build dependencies were missing, causing failures when compiling Rust projects or installing tools like cross.\n                - Solution: Essential build tools and libraries (build-essential, pkg-config, libssl-dev, libclang-dev, cmake) are required for compiling Rust projects and their dependencies. The root cause was incomplete system packages in the environment. The solution was to install these packages to resolve compilation and installation errors.\n                - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libclang-dev cmake\n            \n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\",\"instance_template\":\"We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\\n\\n{{repo_related_info}}\\n\\n{{cross_repo_knowledge}}\\n\\nTASK TIPS:\\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.\",\"next_step_template\":\"{{observation}}\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"next_step_no_output_template\":\"Your command ran successfully and did not produce any output.\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"strategy_template\":null,\"demonstration_template\":null,\"success_reflection_template\":\"You are an expert code assistant who just successfully repaired a software project in an automated programming session.
