The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT!

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Install system dependencies (`python3-dev`, `python3-pip`, `build-essential`, etc.).\n2. Install `mpmath` (version >= 0.19).\n3. Create a virtual environment for isolation (optional but recommended).\n4. Install the project from source using `python setup.py install`.\n5. Run the test suite using `python setup.py test`.\n\nFirst, I'll install the system dependencies.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1.

For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4.

Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you.

      "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential system build tools were missing, causing Python package installation failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of compilation tools and development headers required for building Python extensions. The solution was to install the core build-essential package and Python development headers.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Pytest version incompatibility caused import errors of internal APIs.\n    - Solution: The test suite relied on pytest internal APIs (RaisesContext) that were removed in newer versions. The root cause was a version mismatch between the installed pytest and the test code's expectations. The solution was to downgrade pytest to a compatible version.\n    - Action: pip install 'pytest==7.4.4'\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The make command failed due to missing Python 3 during build\n    - Solution: The build process required Python 3 to execute a script (split.py), but it was not installed in the environment. The root cause was the absence of Python 3. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The alternative Python version lacked pip, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of pip for Python 3.11. The solution was to install the pip package for the system, enabling dependency management for the compatible Python version.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed pytest version was incompatible with the test code, causing import errors for RaisesContext\n    - Solution: The test code required an older pytest version due to API changes in pytest 7.0.0 that removed RaisesContext. The root cause was an unpinned pytest dependency in requirements. The solution was to pin pytest to version 6.2.5 for compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i 's/^pytest$/pytest==6.2.5/' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The make command was not found when attempting to build the project\n    - Solution: The make tool was missing in the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building projects using Makefiles. The root cause was an incomplete build toolchain installation. The solution was to install the build-essential package which includes make and other essential build tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\",\"instance_template\":\"We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\\n\\n{{repo_related_info}}\\n\\n{{cross_repo_knowledge}}\\n\\nTASK TIPS:\\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them.
