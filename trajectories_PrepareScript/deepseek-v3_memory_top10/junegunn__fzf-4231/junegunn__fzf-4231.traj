Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager was not installed on the system\n    - Solution: pnpm was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for dependency management in Node.js projects using pnpm. The root cause was the absence of pnpm in the environment configuration, preventing dependency installation. The solution was to install pnpm globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g pnpm@8.10.5\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Git dependency resolved to an incompatible revision\n    - Solution: The root cause was the iovec git dependency defaulting to the latest commit, potentially incompatible with the toolchain. The solution was to pin it to a specific revision (v0.1.4) known to be compatible with the project era and dependencies.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|iovec = { git = \"https://github.com/carllerche/iovec\" }|iovec = { git = \"https://github.com/carllerche/iovec\", rev = \"9dea281203e1779e12421188c0b67c3dcb5872bc\" }|' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The environment lacked clang, cmake, make, and python3, which are required for building and testing the project based on its CMake and Make-based setup. The root cause was an incomplete initial system configuration, as the tools were not pre-installed. The solution was to install the missing packages using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test executable was not found in the expected location after building the project\n    - Solution: The build process placed the SelfTest executable in a subdirectory ('projects') instead of the top-level build directory. This occurred because CMake's project structure output the executable to the directory corresponding to its source location. The root cause was incorrect path assumption during test execution. The solution involved locating the executable in the correct subdirectory and running it from there.\n    - Action: ./projects/SelfTest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The environment lacked clang, cmake, make, and python3, which are required for building and testing the project based on its CMake and Make-based setup. The root cause was an incomplete initial system configuration, as the tools were not pre-installed.

This occurred because CMake's project structure output the executable to the directory corresponding to its source location. The root cause was incorrect path assumption during test execution. The solution involved locating the executable in the correct subdirectory and running it from there.\n    - Action: ./projects/SelfTest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager was not installed on the system\n    - Solution: pnpm was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for dependency management in Node.js projects using pnpm. The root cause was the absence of pnpm in the environment configuration, preventing dependency installation. The solution was to install pnpm globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g pnpm@8.10.5\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Git dependency resolved to an incompatible revision\n    - Solution: The root cause was the iovec git dependency defaulting to the latest commit, potentially incompatible with the toolchain. The solution was to pin it to a specific revision (v0.1.4) known to be compatible with the project era and dependencies.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|iovec = { git = \"https://github.com/carllerche/iovec\" }|iovec = { git = \"https://github.com/carllerche/iovec\", rev = \"9dea281203e1779e12421188c0b67c3dcb5872bc\" }|' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The environment lacked clang, cmake, make, and python3, which are required for building and testing the project based on its CMake and Make-based setup. The root cause was an incomplete initial system configuration, as the tools were not pre-installed. The solution was to install the missing packages using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test executable was not found in the expected location after building the project\n    - Solution: The build process placed the SelfTest executable in a subdirectory ('projects') instead of the top-level build directory. This occurred because CMake's project structure output the executable to the directory corresponding to its source location. The root cause was incorrect path assumption during test execution. The solution involved locating the executable in the correct subdirectory and running it from there.\n    - Action: ./projects/SelfTest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: null\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager was not installed on the system\n    - Solution: pnpm was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for dependency management in Node.js projects using pnpm. The root cause was the absence of pnpm in the environment configuration, preventing dependency installation. The solution was to install pnpm globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g pnpm@8.10.5\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Git dependency resolved to an incompatible revision\n    - Solution: The root cause was the iovec git dependency defaulting to the latest commit, potentially incompatible with the toolchain. The solution was to pin it to a specific revision (v0.1.4) known to be compatible with the project era and dependencies.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|iovec = { git = \"https://github.com/carllerche/iovec\" }|iovec = { git = \"https://github.com/carllerche/iovec\", rev = \"9dea281203e1779e12421188c0b67c3dcb5872bc\" }|' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The environment lacked clang, cmake, make, and python3, which are required for building and testing the project based on its CMake and Make-based setup. The root cause was an incomplete initial system configuration, as the tools were not pre-installed. The solution was to install the missing packages using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test executable was not found in the expected location after building the project\n    - Solution: The build process placed the SelfTest executable in a subdirectory ('projects') instead of the top-level build directory. This occurred because CMake's project structure output the executable to the directory corresponding to its source location. The root cause was incorrect path assumption during test execution. The solution involved locating the executable in the correct subdirectory and running it from there.\n    - Action: ./projects/SelfTest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: null\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager was not installed on the system\n    - Solution: pnpm was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for dependency management in Node.js projects using pnpm. The root cause was the absence of pnpm in the environment configuration, preventing dependency installation. The solution was to install pnpm globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g pnpm@8.10.5\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Git dependency resolved to an incompatible revision\n    - Solution: The root cause was the iovec git dependency defaulting to the latest commit, potentially incompatible with the toolchain. The solution was to pin it to a specific revision (v0.1.4) known to be compatible with the project era and dependencies.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|iovec = { git = \"https://github.com/carllerche/iovec\" }|iovec = { git = \"https://github.com/carllerche/iovec\", rev = \"9dea281203e1779e12421188c0b67c3dcb5872bc\" }|' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The environment lacked clang, cmake, make, and python3, which are required for building and testing the project based on its CMake and Make-based setup. The root cause was an incomplete initial system configuration, as the tools were not pre-installed. The solution was to install the missing packages using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test executable was not found in the expected location after building the project\n    - Solution: The build process placed the SelfTest executable in a subdirectory ('projects') instead of the top-level build directory. This occurred because CMake's project structure output the executable to the directory corresponding to its source location. The root cause was incorrect path assumption during test execution. The solution involved locating the executable in the correct subdirectory and running it from there.\n    - Action: ./projects/SelfTest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: null\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager was not installed on the system\n    - Solution: pnpm was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for dependency management in Node.js projects using pnpm. The root cause was the absence of pnpm in the environment configuration, preventing dependency installation. The solution was to install pnpm globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g pnpm@8.10.5\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Git dependency resolved to an incompatible revision\n    - Solution: The root cause was the iovec git dependency defaulting to the latest commit, potentially incompatible with the toolchain. The solution was to pin it to a specific revision (v0.1.4) known to be compatible with the project era and dependencies.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|iovec = { git = \"https://github.com/carllerche/iovec\" }|iovec = { git = \"https://github.com/carllerche/iovec\", rev = \"9dea281203e1779e12421188c0b67c3dcb5872bc\" }|' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The environment lacked clang, cmake, make, and python3, which are required for building and testing the project based on its CMake and Make-based setup. The root cause was an incomplete initial system configuration, as the tools were not pre-installed. The solution was to install the missing packages using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test executable was not found in the expected location after building the project\n    - Solution: The build process placed the SelfTest executable in a subdirectory ('projects') instead of the top-level build directory. This occurred because CMake's project structure output the executable to the directory corresponding to its source location. The root cause was incorrect path assumption during test execution. The solution involved locating the executable in the correct subdirectory and running it from there.\n    - Action: ./projects/SelfTest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: null\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager was not installed on the system\n    - Solution: pnpm was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for dependency management in Node.js projects using pnpm. The root cause was the absence of pnpm in the environment configuration, preventing dependency installation. The solution was to install pnpm globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g pnpm@8.10.5\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Git dependency resolved to an incompatible revision\n    - Solution: The root cause was the iovec git dependency defaulting to the latest commit, potentially incompatible with the toolchain. The solution was to pin it to a specific revision (v0.1.4) known to be compatible with the project era and dependencies.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|iovec = { git = \"https://github.com/carllerche/iovec\" }|iovec = { git = \"https://github.com/carllerche/iovec\", rev = \"9dea281203e1779e12421188c0b67c3dcb5872bc\" }|' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The environment lacked clang, cmake, make, and python3, which are required for building and testing the project based on its CMake and Make-based setup. The root cause was an incomplete initial system configuration, as the tools were not pre-installed. The solution was to install the missing packages using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test executable was not found in the expected location after building the project\n    - Solution: The build process placed the SelfTest executable in a subdirectory ('projects') instead of the top-level build directory. This occurred because CMake's project structure output the executable to the directory corresponding to its source location. The root cause was incorrect path assumption during test execution. The solution involved locating the executable in the correct subdirectory and running it from there.\n    - Action: ./projects/SelfTest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager was not installed on the system\n    - Solution: pnpm was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for dependency management in Node.js projects using pnpm. The root cause was the absence of pnpm in the environment configuration, preventing dependency installation. The solution was to install pnpm globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g pnpm@8.10.5\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Git dependency resolved to an incompatible revision\n    - Solution: The root cause was the iovec git dependency defaulting to the latest commit, potentially incompatible with the toolchain. The solution was to pin it to a specific revision (v0.1.4) known to be compatible with the project era and dependencies.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|iovec = { git = \"https://github.com/carllerche/iovec\" }|iovec = { git = \"https://github.com/carllerche/iovec\", rev = \"9dea281203e1779e12421188c0b67c3dcb5872bc\" }|' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The environment lacked clang, cmake, make, and python3, which are required for building and testing the project based on its CMake and Make-based setup. The root cause was an incomplete initial system configuration, as the tools were not pre-installed. The solution was to install the missing packages using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test executable was not found in the expected location after building the project\n    - Solution: The build process placed the SelfTest executable in a subdirectory ('projects') instead of the top-level build directory. This occurred because CMake's project structure output the executable to the directory corresponding to its source location. The root cause was incorrect path assumption during test execution. The solution involved locating the executable in the correct subdirectory and running it from there.\n    - Action: ./projects/SelfTest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: null\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager was not installed on the system\n    - Solution: pnpm was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for dependency management in Node.js projects using pnpm. The root cause was the absence of pnpm in the environment configuration, preventing dependency installation. The solution was to install pnpm globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g pnpm@8.10.5\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Git dependency resolved to an incompatible revision\n    - Solution: The root cause was the iovec git dependency defaulting to the latest commit, potentially incompatible with the toolchain. The solution was to pin it to a specific revision (v0.1.4) known to be compatible with the project era and dependencies.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|iovec = { git = \"https://github.com/carllerche/iovec\" }|iovec = { git = \"https://github.com/carllerche/iovec\", rev = \"9dea281203e1779e12421188c0b67c3dcb5872bc\" }|' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The environment lacked clang, cmake, make, and python3, which are required for building and testing the project based on its CMake and Make-based setup. The root cause was an incomplete initial system configuration, as the tools were not pre-installed. The solution was to install the missing packages using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test executable was not found in the expected location after building the project\n    - Solution: The build process placed the SelfTest executable in a subdirectory ('projects') instead of the top-level build directory. This occurred because CMake's project structure output the executable to the directory corresponding to its source location. The root cause was incorrect path assumption during test execution. The solution involved locating the executable in the correct subdirectory and running it from there.\n    - Action: ./projects/SelfTest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: null\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager was not installed on the system\n    - Solution: pnpm was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for dependency management in Node.js projects using pnpm. The root cause was the absence of pnpm in the environment configuration, preventing dependency installation. The solution was to install pnpm globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g pnpm@8.10.5\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Git dependency resolved to an incompatible revision\n    - Solution: The root cause was the iovec git dependency defaulting to the latest commit, potentially incompatible with the toolchain. The solution was to pin it to a specific revision (v0.1.4) known to be compatible with the project era and dependencies.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|iovec = { git = \"https://github.com/carllerche/iovec\" }|iovec = { git = \"https://github.com/carllerche/iovec\", rev = \"9dea281203e1779e12421188c0b67c3dcb5872bc\" }|' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The environment lacked clang, cmake, make, and python3, which are required for building and testing the project based on its CMake and Make-based setup. The root cause was an incomplete initial system configuration, as the tools were not pre-installed. The solution was to install the missing packages using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test executable was not found in the expected location after building the project\n    - Solution: The build process placed the SelfTest executable in a subdirectory ('projects') instead of the top-level build directory. This occurred because CMake's project structure output the executable to the directory corresponding to its source location. The root cause was incorrect path assumption during test execution. The solution involved locating the executable in the correct subdirectory and running it from there.\n    - Action: ./projects/SelfTest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

      "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: null\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager was not installed on the system\n    - Solution: pnpm was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is necessary for dependency management in Node.js projects using pnpm. The root cause was the absence of pnpm in the environment configuration, preventing dependency installation. The solution was to install pnpm globally using npm.\n    - Action: npm install -g pnpm@8.10.5\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Git dependency resolved to an incompatible revision\n    - Solution: The root cause was the iovec git dependency defaulting to the latest commit, potentially incompatible with the toolchain. The solution was to pin it to a specific revision (v0.1.4) known to be compatible with the project era and dependencies.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|iovec = { git = \"https://github.com/carllerche/iovec\" }|iovec = { git = \"https://github.com/carllerche/iovec\", rev = \"9dea281203e1779e12421188c0b67c3dcb5872bc\" }|' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The environment lacked clang, cmake, make, and python3, which are required for building and testing the project based on its CMake and Make-based setup. The root cause was an incomplete initial system configuration, as the tools were not pre-installed. The solution was to install the missing packages using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The test executable was not found in the expected location after building the project\n    - Solution: The build process placed the SelfTest executable in a subdirectory ('projects') instead of the top-level build directory. This occurred because CMake's project structure output the executable to the directory corresponding to its source location. The root cause was incorrect path assumption during test execution. The solution involved locating the executable in the correct subdirectory and running it from there.\n    - Action: ./projects/SelfTest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\",\"instance_template\":\"We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\\n\\n{{repo_related_info}}\\n\\n{{cross_repo_knowledge}}\\n\\nTASK TIPS:\\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them.
