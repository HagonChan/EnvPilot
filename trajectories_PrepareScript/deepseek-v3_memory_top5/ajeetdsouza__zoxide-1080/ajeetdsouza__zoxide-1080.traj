Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo install zoxide --locked\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The cargo command was unavailable in the current shell after Rust installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the PATH environment variable not being updated to include the cargo binary directory. The solution was sourcing the environment configuration file provided by rustup to reload the PATH and enable Rust commands in the session.\n    - Action: . /usr/local/cargo/env\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing, causing the Rust project to fail during compilation with errors about missing system libraries\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of critical build dependencies (e.g., libgcc) in the minimal Alpine environment, required for Rust compilation. The solution was to install the build-base package to provide necessary compilers and libraries.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo install zoxide --locked\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The cargo command was unavailable in the current shell after Rust installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the PATH environment variable not being updated to include the cargo binary directory. The solution was sourcing the environment configuration file provided by rustup to reload the PATH and enable Rust commands in the session.\n    - Action: . /usr/local/cargo/env\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing, causing the Rust project to fail during compilation with errors about missing system libraries\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of critical build dependencies (e.g., libgcc) in the minimal Alpine environment, required for Rust compilation. The solution was to install the build-base package to provide necessary compilers and libraries.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo install zoxide --locked\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The cargo command was unavailable in the current shell after Rust installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the PATH environment variable not being updated to include the cargo binary directory. The solution was sourcing the environment configuration file provided by rustup to reload the PATH and enable Rust commands in the session.\n    - Action: . /usr/local/cargo/env\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing, causing the Rust project to fail during compilation with errors about missing system libraries\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of critical build dependencies (e.g., libgcc) in the minimal Alpine environment, required for Rust compilation. The solution was to install the build-base package to provide necessary compilers and libraries.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo install zoxide --locked\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The cargo command was unavailable in the current shell after Rust installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the PATH environment variable not being updated to include the cargo binary directory. The solution was sourcing the environment configuration file provided by rustup to reload the PATH and enable Rust commands in the session.\n    - Action: . /usr/local/cargo/env\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing, causing the Rust project to fail during compilation with errors about missing system libraries\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of critical build dependencies (e.g., libgcc) in the minimal Alpine environment, required for Rust compilation. The solution was to install the build-base package to provide necessary compilers and libraries.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo install zoxide --locked\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The cargo command was unavailable in the current shell after Rust installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the PATH environment variable not being updated to include the cargo binary directory. The solution was sourcing the environment configuration file provided by rustup to reload the PATH and enable Rust commands in the session.\n    - Action: . /usr/local/cargo/env\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing, causing the Rust project to fail during compilation with errors about missing system libraries\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of critical build dependencies (e.g., libgcc) in the minimal Alpine environment, required for Rust compilation. The solution was to install the build-base package to provide necessary compilers and libraries.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them.

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo install zoxide --locked\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The cargo command was unavailable in the current shell after Rust installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the PATH environment variable not being updated to include the cargo binary directory. The solution was sourcing the environment configuration file provided by rustup to reload the PATH and enable Rust commands in the session.\n    - Action: . /usr/local/cargo/env\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing, causing the Rust project to fail during compilation with errors about missing system libraries\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of critical build dependencies (e.g., libgcc) in the minimal Alpine environment, required for Rust compilation. The solution was to install the build-base package to provide necessary compilers and libraries.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo install zoxide --locked\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The cargo command was unavailable in the current shell after Rust installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the PATH environment variable not being updated to include the cargo binary directory. The solution was sourcing the environment configuration file provided by rustup to reload the PATH and enable Rust commands in the session.\n    - Action: . /usr/local/cargo/env\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing, causing the Rust project to fail during compilation with errors about missing system libraries\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of critical build dependencies (e.g., libgcc) in the minimal Alpine environment, required for Rust compilation. The solution was to install the build-base package to provide necessary compilers and libraries.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo install zoxide --locked\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The cargo command was unavailable in the current shell after Rust installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the PATH environment variable not being updated to include the cargo binary directory. The solution was sourcing the environment configuration file provided by rustup to reload the PATH and enable Rust commands in the session.\n    - Action: . /usr/local/cargo/env\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing, causing the Rust project to fail during compilation with errors about missing system libraries\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of critical build dependencies (e.g., libgcc) in the minimal Alpine environment, required for Rust compilation. The solution was to install the build-base package to provide necessary compilers and libraries.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo install zoxide --locked\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The cargo command was unavailable in the current shell after Rust installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the PATH environment variable not being updated to include the cargo binary directory. The solution was sourcing the environment configuration file provided by rustup to reload the PATH and enable Rust commands in the session.\n    - Action: . /usr/local/cargo/env\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing, causing the Rust project to fail during compilation with errors about missing system libraries\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of critical build dependencies (e.g., libgcc) in the minimal Alpine environment, required for Rust compilation. The solution was to install the build-base package to provide necessary compilers and libraries.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo install zoxide --locked\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The cargo command was unavailable in the current shell after Rust installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the PATH environment variable not being updated to include the cargo binary directory. The solution was sourcing the environment configuration file provided by rustup to reload the PATH and enable Rust commands in the session.\n    - Action: . /usr/local/cargo/env\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing, causing the Rust project to fail during compilation with errors about missing system libraries\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of critical build dependencies (e.g., libgcc) in the minimal Alpine environment, required for Rust compilation. The solution was to install the build-base package to provide necessary compilers and libraries.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo install zoxide --locked\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The cargo command was unavailable in the current shell after Rust installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the PATH environment variable not being updated to include the cargo binary directory. The solution was sourcing the environment configuration file provided by rustup to reload the PATH and enable Rust commands in the session.\n    - Action: . /usr/local/cargo/env\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing, causing the Rust project to fail during compilation with errors about missing system libraries\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of critical build dependencies (e.g., libgcc) in the minimal Alpine environment, required for Rust compilation. The solution was to install the build-base package to provide necessary compilers and libraries.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The cargo command was unavailable in the current shell after Rust installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the PATH environment variable not being updated to include the cargo binary directory. The solution was sourcing the environment configuration file provided by rustup to reload the PATH and enable Rust commands in the session.\n    - Action: . /usr/local/cargo/env\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing, causing the Rust project to fail during compilation with errors about missing system libraries\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of critical build dependencies (e.g., libgcc) in the minimal Alpine environment, required for Rust compilation. The solution was to install the build-base package to provide necessary compilers and libraries.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The cargo command was unavailable in the current shell after Rust installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the PATH environment variable not being updated to include the cargo binary directory. The solution was sourcing the environment configuration file provided by rustup to reload the PATH and enable Rust commands in the session.\n    - Action: . /usr/local/cargo/env\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing, causing the Rust project to fail during compilation with errors about missing system libraries\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of critical build dependencies (e.g., libgcc) in the minimal Alpine environment, required for Rust compilation. The solution was to install the build-base package to provide necessary compilers and libraries.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo install zoxide --locked\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The cargo command was unavailable in the current shell after Rust installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the PATH environment variable not being updated to include the cargo binary directory. The solution was sourcing the environment configuration file provided by rustup to reload the PATH and enable Rust commands in the session.\n    - Action: . /usr/local/cargo/env\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing, causing the Rust project to fail during compilation with errors about missing system libraries\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of critical build dependencies (e.g., libgcc) in the minimal Alpine environment, required for Rust compilation. The solution was to install the build-base package to provide necessary compilers and libraries.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo install zoxide --locked\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The cargo command was unavailable in the current shell after Rust installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the PATH environment variable not being updated to include the cargo binary directory. The solution was sourcing the environment configuration file provided by rustup to reload the PATH and enable Rust commands in the session.\n    - Action: . /usr/local/cargo/env\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing, causing the Rust project to fail during compilation with errors about missing system libraries\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of critical build dependencies (e.g., libgcc) in the minimal Alpine environment, required for Rust compilation. The solution was to install the build-base package to provide necessary compilers and libraries.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo install zoxide --locked\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The cargo command was unavailable in the current shell after Rust installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the PATH environment variable not being updated to include the cargo binary directory. The solution was sourcing the environment configuration file provided by rustup to reload the PATH and enable Rust commands in the session.\n    - Action: . /usr/local/cargo/env\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing, causing the Rust project to fail during compilation with errors about missing system libraries\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of critical build dependencies (e.g., libgcc) in the minimal Alpine environment, required for Rust compilation. The solution was to install the build-base package to provide necessary compilers and libraries.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo install zoxide --locked\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The cargo command was unavailable in the current shell after Rust installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the PATH environment variable not being updated to include the cargo binary directory. The solution was sourcing the environment configuration file provided by rustup to reload the PATH and enable Rust commands in the session.\n    - Action: . /usr/local/cargo/env\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing, causing the Rust project to fail during compilation with errors about missing system libraries\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of critical build dependencies (e.g., libgcc) in the minimal Alpine environment, required for Rust compilation. The solution was to install the build-base package to provide necessary compilers and libraries.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo install zoxide --locked\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The cargo command was unavailable in the current shell after Rust installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the PATH environment variable not being updated to include the cargo binary directory. The solution was sourcing the environment configuration file provided by rustup to reload the PATH and enable Rust commands in the session.\n    - Action: . /usr/local/cargo/env\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing, causing the Rust project to fail during compilation with errors about missing system libraries\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of critical build dependencies (e.g., libgcc) in the minimal Alpine environment, required for Rust compilation. The solution was to install the build-base package to provide necessary compilers and libraries.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo install zoxide --locked\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The cargo command was unavailable in the current shell after Rust installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the PATH environment variable not being updated to include the cargo binary directory. The solution was sourcing the environment configuration file provided by rustup to reload the PATH and enable Rust commands in the session.\n    - Action: . /usr/local/cargo/env\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing, causing the Rust project to fail during compilation with errors about missing system libraries\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of critical build dependencies (e.g., libgcc) in the minimal Alpine environment, required for Rust compilation. The solution was to install the build-base package to provide necessary compilers and libraries.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT!

      "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo install zoxide --locked\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The cargo command was unavailable in the current shell after Rust installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the PATH environment variable not being updated to include the cargo binary directory. The solution was sourcing the environment configuration file provided by rustup to reload the PATH and enable Rust commands in the session.\n    - Action: . /usr/local/cargo/env\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools were missing, causing the Rust project to fail during compilation with errors about missing system libraries\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of critical build dependencies (e.g., libgcc) in the minimal Alpine environment, required for Rust compilation. The solution was to install the build-base package to provide necessary compilers and libraries.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\",\"instance_template\":\"We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\\n\\n{{repo_related_info}}\\n\\n{{cross_repo_knowledge}}\\n\\nTASK TIPS:\\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.\",\"next_step_template\":\"{{observation}}\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"next_step_no_output_template\":\"Your command ran successfully and did not produce any output.\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"strategy_template\":null,\"demonstration_template\":null,\"success_reflection_template\":\"You are an expert code assistant who just successfully repaired a software project in an automated programming session.

If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\\n  signature: search_dir <search_term> [<dir>]\\n  arguments:\\n    - search_term (string) [required]: the term to search for\\n    - dir (string) [optional]: the directory to search in (if not provided, searches in the current directory)\\n\\nsearch_file:\\n  docstring: searches for search_term in file. If file is not provided, searches in the current open file\\n  signature: search_file <search_term> [<file>]\\n  arguments:\\n    - search_term (string) [required]: the term to search for\\n    - file (string) [optional]: the file to search in (if not provided, searches in the current open file)\\n\\nedit:\\n  docstring: Replace first occurrence of <search> with <replace> in the currently displayed lines. If replace-all is True , replace all occurrences of <search> with <replace>.\\nFor example, if you are looking at this file:\\ndef fct():\\n    print(\\\"Hello world\\\")\\n\\nand you want to edit the file to read:\\ndef fct():\\n    print(\\\"Hello\\\")\\n    print(\\\"world\\\")\\n\\nyou can search for `Hello world` and replace with `\\\"Hello\\\"\\\\n    print(\\\"world\\\")` (note the extra spaces before the print statement!).\\nTips:\\n1. Always include proper whitespace/indentation 2. When you are adding an if/with/try statement, you need to INDENT the block that follows, so make sure to include it in both your search and replace strings! 3. If you are wrapping code in a try statement, make sure to also add an 'except' or 'finally' block.\\nBefore every edit, please\\n1. Explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing the problem 2. Explain the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem 3. Explain how the edit does not break existing functionality\\n\\n  signature: edit <search> <replace> [<replace-all>]\\n\\n  arguments:\\n    - search (string) [required]: the text to search for (make sure to include proper whitespace if needed)\\n    - replace (string) [required]: the text to replace the search with (make sure to include proper whitespace if needed)\\n    - replace-all (boolean) [optional]: replace all occurrences rather than the first occurrence within the displayed lines\\n\\ninsert:\\n  docstring: Insert <text> at the end of the currently opened file or after <line> if specified.\\n\\n  signature: insert <text> [<line>]\\n\\n  arguments:\\n    - text (string) [required]: the text to insert\\n    - line (integer) [optional]: the line number to insert the text as new lines after\\n\\nsubmit:\\n  docstring: submits the current file\\n  signature: submit\\n\\n\",\"multi_line_command_endings\":{},\"submit_command_end_name\":null,\"reset_commands\":[],\"execution_timeout\":32400,\"install_timeout\":3600},\"history_processors\":[{\"n\":5,\"always_remove_output_for_tags\":[\"remove_output\"],\"always_keep_output_for_tags\":[\"keep_output\"],\"type\":\"last_n_observations\"}],\"model\":{\"name\":\"openai/deepseek-v3-250324\",\"per_instance_cost_limit\":3.0,\"total_cost_limit\":0.0,\"total_api_calls_limit\":50,\"temperature\":0.0,\"top_p\":1.0,\"api_base\":\"https://ark.cn-beijing.volces.com/api/v3\",\"api_version\":\"2024-03-01-preview\",\"api_key\":\"**********\",\"stop\":[],\"completion_kwargs\":{},\"convert_system_to_user\":false,\"retry\":{\"retries\":5,\"min_wait\":1.0,\"max_wait\":15.0},\"delay\":0.0,\"fallbacks\":[]},\"embedding_model\":{\"name\":\"huggingface/Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B\",\"per_instance_cost_limit\":3.0,\"total_cost_limit\":0.0,\"total_api_calls_limit\":0,\"temperature\":0.0,\"top_p\":1.0,\"api_base\":\"http://127.0.0.1:8080\",\"api_version\":null,\"api_key\":null,\"stop\":[],\"completion_kwargs\":{},\"convert_system_to_user\":false,\"retry\":{\"retries\":5,\"min_wait\":1.0,\"max_wait\":15.0},\"delay\":0.0,\"fallbacks\":[]},\"max_requeries\":3,\"use_memory\":true,\"topk\":5},\"problem_statement\":{\"text\":\"/home/lhy/work/Env-Bench-Code/EnvBench\",\"extra_fields\":{},\"type\":\"text\",\"id\":\"ajeetdsouza__zoxide-1080\"},\"output_dir\":\"DEFAULT\",\"actions\":{\"open_pr\":false,\"pr_config\":{\"skip_if_commits_reference_issue\":true},\"apply_patch_locally\":false},\"env_var_path\":null}",
