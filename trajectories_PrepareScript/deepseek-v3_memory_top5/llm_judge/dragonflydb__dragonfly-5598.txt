"FAILED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nBased on the agent's output trajectory, the environment configuration did not meet the success criteria:\n\n**Condition 1: Test Suite Execution**\n- No test suite was executed or completed successfully\n- The build process failed to generate the necessary build files (build.ninja)\n- The project could not be compiled due to missing AWS dependencies and subsequent configuration issues\n- No test framework (ctest) was invoked or executed\n\n**Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification**\n- Core modules could not be imported or built successfully\n- The build process failed at multiple stages:\n  - AWS dependency download failures\n  - Missing header files (absl, glog) even after installation\n  - Ninja build system configuration issues\n- No core functionality was demonstrated through example code execution\n\n**Key Failure Points:**\n1. AWS dependency download failures prevented successful compilation\n2. Even after disabling AWS, the build system failed to generate proper Ninja files\n3. Missing header files persisted despite package installations\n4. No test execution was attempted or completed\n5. The project never reached a state where core functionality could be verified\n\nThe environment configuration process encountered fundamental build system issues that prevented both test execution and core functionality verification, resulting in a failed configuration."
