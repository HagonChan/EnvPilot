"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite (`make test`) successfully started, executed, and completed, generating a comprehensive test report. While there were 2 test failures out of 1895 tests, the test framework (pytest) completed its execution and produced a detailed coverage report (98% coverage). This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execution, even with some individual test failures.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core modules of the project (seaborn) were successfully imported and installed in development mode. The majority of the test cases (1895 passed) demonstrate that the core functionality is working as expected. The two remaining failures are non-critical (one related to numerical precision in a statistical test and another related to SSL issues when fetching external datasets), which do not affect the fundamental operation of the library.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful as both criteria are met: the test suite completed execution and the core functionality is verified to be working. The minor test failures do not impact the overall success as they are edge cases or environment-specific issues."
