"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully built the Halide project and executed internal tests, as evidenced by the output \"Success!\" and the passing of multiple test cases (e.g., IRPrinter test, CodeGen_C test, Bounds test, etc.). This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The build process completed without critical errors, and the test suite executed, indicating that core modules were imported and used normally. The successful execution of tests like `Generator test` and `Target test` demonstrates basic API functionality and core features, meeting Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning:\n- **Condition 1**: The test suite executed and completed successfully, with multiple tests passing (e.g., `IRPrinter test`, `CodeGen_C test`, `Bounds test`). This confirms the testing framework generated a complete report structure and executed the suite, even though some tests were skipped due to target compatibility (e.g., AVX-512 features).\n- **Condition 2**: The build process succeeded, and the tests verified core functionality (e.g., `Generator test`, `Target test`). The output confirms that the project's main modules were functional and API calls returned expected results.\n\n### Notes:\n- The agent resolved dependency issues (e.g., `g++-7` â†’ `g++-9`, `LLVM`, `Clang`, `LLD`, `zlib`) and configured the environment correctly.\n- Non-critical warnings (e.g., skipped tests due to hardware limitations) did not affect the overall success."
