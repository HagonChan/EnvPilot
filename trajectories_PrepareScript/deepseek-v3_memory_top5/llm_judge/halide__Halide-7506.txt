"FAILED\n1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**: The agent did not successfully execute any test suite. While the build and installation process completed, the project was explicitly configured with `-DWITH_TESTS=NO`, meaning no tests were built or run. The agent attempted to locate tests but found none, and no test report was generated.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**: The agent did not verify core functionality. Although the build and installation succeeded, there was no demonstration of importing core modules, making API calls, or running example code to confirm basic functionality. The attempt to check the installation via `halide-config` failed, and no alternative verification was performed.\n\nThe environment configuration does not meet the success criteria because neither condition was satisfied. The build was successful, but without test execution or core functionality verification, the configuration cannot be considered fully operational."
