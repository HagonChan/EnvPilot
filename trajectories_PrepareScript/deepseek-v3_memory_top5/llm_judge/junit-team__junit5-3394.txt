"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed the Gradle build process, which includes running tests. Although there were some test failures and build issues, the test suite was able to start and complete execution. The Gradle build process generated a complete test report structure, which is evident from the output logs showing task execution and test results.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent verified that the core modules could be imported and used normally. The main functional modules (JUnit Jupiter, JUnit Platform, etc.) were successfully built, and basic API calls returned expected results. The agent also demonstrated core features through example code execution by running the Gradle build process.\n\nThe environment configuration meets the success criteria because:\n- At least one complete test suite (Gradle build) executed and finished, even though some individual test cases failed.\n- Core modules were successfully built and verified, confirming that the main functional modules work as expected.\n- The agent addressed and resolved several environment configuration issues (Java version, Gradle wrapper, GraalVM installation) to achieve basic functionality."
