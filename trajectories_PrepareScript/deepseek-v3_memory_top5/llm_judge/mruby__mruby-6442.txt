"PASSED\n1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The test suite completed successfully with a detailed report showing 1610 passing tests and 8 skipped tests in the library tests, plus 100 passing binary tests. The test framework generated a complete report structure with totals for OK, KO, Crash, Warning, and Skip statuses.\n2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The build process completed without errors, compiling numerous source files successfully. The test execution demonstrates that core modules can be imported and used normally, as evidenced by the high number of passing tests across both library and binary tests. The skipped tests were explicitly marked and don't indicate core functionality issues.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria:\n- At least one complete test suite executed and finished successfully\n- Core functionality was verified through extensive test results\n- All required dependencies were properly installed\n- The build process completed without critical errors"
