"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The Maven build successfully executed the test suite (`mvn -B clean test -Prelease`), and the test framework generated complete test reports. Although there was initially a test failure (`ProxySelectorMapperTest.existed`), it was resolved by fixing the SQL query, and subsequent test runs completed successfully.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core modules were successfully built and installed (`mvn -B clean install -DskipTests -Prelease`), and the main functional modules can be imported and used normally. The successful build and test execution demonstrate that the core functionality is operational.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria, as the test suite completed successfully and the core functionality is verified. The initial test failure was non-critical and was resolved, allowing the build to pass."
