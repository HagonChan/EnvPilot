"FAILED\n1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): The test suite failed to execute successfully. Despite multiple attempts with different configurations (increasing memory limits, downgrading Vitest, running individual test files), the tests consistently failed with a \"WebAssembly.instantiate(): Out of memory\" error. No test suite completed execution, and no test report was generated.\n\n2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): While the core modules could likely be imported (this wasn't explicitly tested), the inability to run any tests means we cannot verify that the main functional modules work as expected. The test failures prevent us from demonstrating core features through example code execution.\n\nThe environment configuration process successfully installed Node.js 16.x and Yarn, and dependencies were installed, but the critical test execution phase failed repeatedly. Since both success criteria require test execution to pass, this configuration attempt must be considered a failure. The memory-related errors suggest either an environment limitation or a deeper compatibility issue with the testing setup."
