"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed multiple test suites, including `go test --tags=stringlabels ./tsdb/ -test.tsdb-isolation=false` and `go test --tags=dedupelabels ./...`, which completed without errors. The test framework generated complete test reports, and all tests passed, meeting the success criteria for test suite execution.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent verified that the main functional modules could be imported and used normally. Core features were demonstrated through successful test executions, and basic API calls returned expected results. The project's dependencies were correctly installed, and the build process completed successfully, confirming core functionality.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful as both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) are met. The agent addressed all encountered issues, such as installing the correct Go version, resolving npm dependencies, and upgrading Node.js, ensuring the project's requirements were satisfied."
