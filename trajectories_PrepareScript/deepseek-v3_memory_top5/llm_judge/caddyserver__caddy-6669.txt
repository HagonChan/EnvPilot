"PASSED\n1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The test suite completed successfully on the second run, with all tests passing. The initial failure appears to have been a transient issue that resolved itself when tests were re-run individually and then collectively. The testing framework generated complete test reports for all test cases.\n2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The project built successfully with `go build` and core modules were imported and used normally during test execution. The test output shows successful execution of core functionality tests across multiple packages.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria:\n- The test suite completed execution (despite initial transient failure)\n- Core functionality was verified through successful test execution\n- The project built successfully and dependencies were properly installed\n- The correct Go version (1.23.0) was installed and configured as specified in go.mod"
