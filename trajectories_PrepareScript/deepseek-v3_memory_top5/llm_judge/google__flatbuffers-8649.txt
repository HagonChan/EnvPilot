"PASSED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n**Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - SUCCESS**\n- The test suite `./flattests` executed successfully and completed without errors\n- The output shows \"ALL TESTS PASSED\" indicating the test framework ran to completion\n- The test suite generated a complete execution report (all tests passed)\n- Individual test failures would have been acceptable as long as the suite completed, but in this case all tests passed\n\n**Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - SUCCESS**\n- The project was successfully built using CMake and Make\n- All compilation steps completed without errors\n- Multiple executable targets were built including `flatc`, `flattests`, and sample applications\n- The core functionality was demonstrated through the successful test execution\n- The build process included compilation of multiple language generators (C++, C#, Dart, Kotlin, Go, Java, TypeScript, PHP, Python, etc.), confirming core modules work\n\n**Additional Success Indicators:**\n- The environment was properly configured with required dependencies (g++-11, clang-14, cmake, make)\n- The CMake configuration completed successfully\n- The build process compiled all components including the main flatbuffers library, flatc compiler, and test suite\n- The project follows the repository's CI/CD configuration from the GitHub workflows\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria: test suite execution completed successfully and core functionality is verified through successful compilation and test execution."
