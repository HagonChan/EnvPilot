"PASSED\n1. Test Suite Execution: The agent successfully executed the test suite using Maven (`mvn test`). The output shows that multiple test suites completed successfully across different modules (core, GREL, main, server, extensions, etc.). While some tests were skipped (like in the benchmark module), the critical test suites executed and completed, generating test reports as evidenced by the Jacoco coverage tool being invoked.\n\n2. Core Functionality Verification: The agent successfully built the project (`mvn clean install`) and verified core functionality by:\n   - Installing all required dependencies (Java 21, Maven, Node.js 18)\n   - Building all main modules successfully (excluding the non-critical packaging module)\n   - Running tests that exercise core functionality\n   - The build output shows successful compilation and test execution across all key modules\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria - test suites completed execution and core functionality was verified, despite some non-critical test skips and the packaging module being excluded. The agent properly handled dependency installation and build configuration to achieve a working environment."
