"PASSED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n**Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - SUCCESS**\n- The agent successfully executed `cargo test` which ran the complete test suite\n- The test framework generated a complete test report structure showing:\n  - 1 unit test passed (error::tests::assert_send_sync)\n  - 18 documentation tests passed\n- All tests completed successfully with \"test result: ok\" for both test types\n- The test suite finished execution in 57.02 seconds for compilation and 0.51 seconds for doc tests\n\n**Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - SUCCESS**\n- The project was successfully built from source using `cargo test`\n- All core modules compiled without errors (iced_core, iced_widget, iced_renderer, etc.)\n- The build process completed the compilation of 399 targets\n- The Rust toolchain (version 1.89.0) was properly installed and configured\n- All required system dependencies (libxkbcommon-dev, libgtk-3-dev, build tools) were installed\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe environment configuration was successful as both criteria were met. The test suite executed completely with all tests passing, and the core functionality was verified through successful compilation and execution of the test framework. The agent properly installed all required dependencies, configured the Rust toolchain, and executed the test command without modifying any test cases or using prohibited installation methods."
