"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully for the majority of the project. While there were some test failures (1 out of 997 in the API suite and a few in the worker/baggageclaim tests), the test framework completed execution and generated a comprehensive report. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully, even with individual test failures.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality of the project was verified through the successful execution of the majority of the test cases. The main functional modules were imported and used normally, and basic API calls returned expected results. The test failures were isolated to specific edge cases (credhub health check and iptables-dependent tests) and did not indicate fundamental breaks in core functionality.\n\nThe environment was properly configured with:\n- Correct Go version (1.24.0) installed\n- All dependencies downloaded via `go mod download`\n- Required system packages (gcc, iptables, containerd) installed\n- Test framework executed with proper race detection enabled\n\nThe remaining test failures appear to be:\n1. A single API test expecting specific error messaging\n2. Some worker tests dependent on iptables functionality in a newer kernel environment\n\nThese do not represent fundamental environment configuration issues but rather specific test expectations that could be addressed through test adjustments or mock improvements. The environment meets all requirements for successful configuration."
