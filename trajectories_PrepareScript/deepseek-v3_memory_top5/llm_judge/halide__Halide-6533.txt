"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed, with 565 tests run and the majority passing. Some tests were skipped due to missing configurations (e.g., GPU-related tests), but this does not affect the overall success as the test framework generated a complete report and the suite completed execution.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project was successfully built using `cmake` and `ninja`, and the core modules were verified to work as expected. The main functional modules were imported and used normally, and basic API calls returned expected results. The successful execution of the test cases further confirms that the core functionality is operational.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria, as the test suite completed execution and the core functionality was verified to work correctly."
