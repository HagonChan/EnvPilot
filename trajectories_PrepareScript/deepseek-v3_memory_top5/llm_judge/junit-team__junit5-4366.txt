"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The Gradle build process successfully executed multiple test suites, including `platform-tooling-support-tests`, `jupiter-tests`, and `platform-tests`. Although one test failed (`MavenSurefireCompatibilityTests`), the test suites completed and generated reports (e.g., `file:///testbed/platform-tooling-support-tests/build/reports/tests/test/index.html`). This meets Condition 1, as the test framework executed and produced results.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The build process completed successfully for most modules, indicating that core functionality is intact. The project's main modules were compiled and tested, and the Gradle tasks (e.g., `build`, `test`) ran without critical errors. The failure was limited to a single test case, which does not affect the overall operability of the framework. This meets Condition 2, as the core features are functional.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful because the test suites executed fully, and the core functionality was verified, despite the non-critical test failure."
