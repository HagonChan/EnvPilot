"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite completed successfully with a full test report structure. While there were some test failures (1 failed test suite and 4 failed tests out of 325 total tests), the majority of tests passed, and the test framework executed to completion. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The environment was properly configured with Node.js v22.9.0 and Yarn 4.0.2 as specified in the project requirements. All dependencies were successfully installed, and the test command executed without any framework-level errors, indicating the core functionality is operational. This meets Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful because both conditions are satisfied: the test suite completed execution (despite some test failures) and core functionality was verified through successful dependency installation and test framework execution."
