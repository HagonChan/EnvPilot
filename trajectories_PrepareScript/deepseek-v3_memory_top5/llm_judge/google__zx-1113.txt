"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully, completing 205 tests with 202 passes and 2 failures. The test framework generated a complete report structure, including details about suites, passes, failures, and durations. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria, as the test suite completed execution despite some individual test failures.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules were successfully imported and used. The project built successfully (`npm run build`), and core functionality was demonstrated through the execution of multiple test cases. The two failing tests were related to specific edge cases (non-standard extensions and ANSI color formatting) rather than core functionality, which still works as expected. This meets Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful because:\n- The test framework (Jest) executed and produced a complete test report\n- Core modules were importable and functional\n- The majority of tests passed, demonstrating basic functionality\n- The two failures were non-critical (edge cases and environment-specific color support)"
