"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The PHPUnit test suite executed successfully with 432 tests run and 6 skipped. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, and the suite completed without critical failures. The warning about XDEBUG_MODE=coverage does not prevent the tests from running and completing.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules (Slim framework and related components) were successfully installed via Composer. The ability to run the test suite confirms that core functionality is operational. The test output shows assertions were made (789 assertions), indicating the core features are being exercised and verified.\n\nThe environment meets both success criteria:\n- At least one complete test suite executed successfully (PHPUnit)\n- Core functionality is verified through test execution and dependency installation\n\nNote: While there were 6 skipped tests and a coverage warning, these don't constitute critical failures that would prevent the environment from being considered successfully configured. The skipped tests may warrant further investigation in a production scenario, but don't affect the basic success criteria for this evaluation."
