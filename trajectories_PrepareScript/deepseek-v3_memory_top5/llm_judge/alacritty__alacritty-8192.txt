"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully ran `cargo test`, which executed multiple test suites including unit tests and integration tests. The output shows that all tests passed (127 in alacritty_terminal, 44 in ref.rs, and doc-tests), with a complete test report structure generated. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project was successfully built using `cargo build`, and the test execution demonstrates that core functional modules can be imported and used normally. The passing tests verify that basic API calls return expected results and core features work as demonstrated through the test cases. This meets Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe agent encountered and resolved several environment configuration issues (missing curl, rustup installation problems, pkg-config, fontconfig, and g++), ultimately achieving a fully functional build and test environment. All test suites completed successfully, and core functionality was verified, fulfilling both success criteria."
