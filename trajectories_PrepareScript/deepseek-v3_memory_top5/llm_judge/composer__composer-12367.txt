"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite (PHPUnit) was successfully executed, completing 2499 tests with some failures and skipped tests. The test framework generated a complete report structure, indicating that the test suite ran to completion.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules (Composer) were successfully imported and used. Basic API calls returned expected results, and core features were demonstrated through the test execution. The environment was properly configured with all necessary PHP extensions and dependencies.\n\nThe remaining test failures are non-critical (mostly warnings about version detection) and do not affect the overall functionality of the project. The environment meets both success criteria."
