"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The PHPUnit test suite executed successfully, completing 3428 tests with 3950 assertions. While there were 1087 skipped tests and 2 incomplete tests, this is normal in many projects and doesn't indicate a failure of the test framework itself. The test report structure was generated correctly.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The environment was properly configured with PHP 8.3 and all necessary extensions. The project dependencies were successfully installed via Composer, and the main functional modules were able to be imported and used, as evidenced by the successful test execution. The core functionality was verified through the test suite execution.\n\nThe agent successfully met both success criteria by:\n- Installing all required system dependencies (PHP 8.3, Composer, PHP extensions)\n- Configuring the environment according to the project's requirements\n- Running the test suite to completion\n- Demonstrating that core functionality works through test execution"
