"PASSED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n**Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - SUCCESS**\n- The agent successfully executed `cargo test` which ran multiple test suites including:\n  - Unit tests (223 passed, 0 failed)\n  - Documentation tests for various modules (rocket_sync_db_pools, rocket_ws, etc.)\n  - Integration tests across different components\n- The test framework completed execution and generated a comprehensive test report structure showing all test results\n- All test suites finished successfully with no failures reported\n\n**Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - SUCCESS**\n- The project was successfully built using `cargo build` with all dependencies compiled\n- Core modules were imported and compiled without errors\n- The Rust toolchain (rustc 1.89.0, cargo 1.89.0) was properly installed and configured\n- All system dependencies (libmysqlclient-dev, libpq-dev, libsqlite3-dev, build-essential) were installed\n- The build process completed with only minor warnings about unused variables, which don't affect core functionality\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe environment configuration was completely successful. Both success criteria are met:\n1. Multiple test suites executed to completion with comprehensive reporting\n2. Core functionality works as demonstrated by successful compilation and test execution\n3. All required system dependencies and build tools were properly installed\n4. The Rust ecosystem (cargo, rustc) is fully functional\n\nThe agent followed the proper priority order by examining CI/CD configuration first, then installing necessary dependencies, and finally running the test suite as specified in the workflow files."
