"PASSED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nBased on the agent's output trajectory, the environment configuration successfully meets both success criteria:\n\n**Condition 1: Test Suite Execution ✓**\n- The PHPUnit test suite completed successfully with 1800 tests executed\n- The testing framework generated a complete test report structure showing:\n  - Total tests: 1800\n  - Assertions: 2644  \n  - Skipped tests: 1 (acceptable per criteria)\n  - Memory usage: 32.00 MB\n  - Execution time: 00:00.684\n- The test suite finished with \"OK, but incomplete, skipped, or risky tests!\" which indicates successful completion despite the single skipped test\n\n**Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification ✓**\n- All project dependencies were successfully installed via Composer\n- The PHP environment was properly configured with required extensions (php7.4, php7.4-cli, php7.4-xml, php7.4-mbstring)\n- Composer was correctly installed and configured for PHP 7.4 compatibility\n- The test framework (PHPUnit) was able to execute the complete test suite without framework-level errors\n\nThe agent successfully resolved installation challenges (PHP 7.4 availability, Composer version compatibility, missing mbstring extension) and achieved a fully functional environment where both the test suite completes execution and core functionality is verified through successful test execution."
