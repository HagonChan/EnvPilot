"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed with `pnpm turbo --filter tests test-ci`. While there were 2 test failures out of 128 test files, the test suite completed and generated a test report structure (as shown in the output with detailed test results). This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria, as the test suite completed despite some individual test failures.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The environment was properly configured with Node.js and pnpm, and dependencies were installed successfully. The core functionality was verified by the fact that the test suite ran and most tests passed, indicating that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally. The test output shows that the test framework (Vitest) executed the tests, which implies the core functionality is operational.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful because both conditions are met: the test suite completed execution, and the core functionality was verified through the test execution. The few test failures do not invalidate the success, as the criteria focus on framework operability rather than test pass rates."
