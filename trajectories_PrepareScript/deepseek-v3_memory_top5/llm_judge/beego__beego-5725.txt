"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed multiple test suites (PostgreSQL and MySQL) as specified in the CI/CD configuration. While the SQLite3 tests encountered issues, the PostgreSQL and MySQL tests completed successfully, generating test reports and passing the majority of test cases. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute successfully.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent demonstrated that core functionality works by:\n   - Successfully installing and configuring all required dependencies (Go 1.22, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)\n   - Properly setting up the test environments for different databases\n   - Executing the main test commands from the project's CI/CD configuration\n   - Showing that the ORM package can be imported and used (as evidenced by the test executions)\n\nThe agent followed a systematic approach to environment configuration, addressed installation issues (like PostgreSQL authentication), and ultimately achieved successful test execution for multiple database backends. While there were some test failures (particularly with SQLite3), the overall test framework operated as expected and core functionality was verified."
