"FAILED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nBased on the agent's output trajectory, the environment configuration does not meet the success criteria for the following reasons:\n\n**Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - FAILED**\n- The test suite execution did not complete successfully. While some tests passed, the overall test run failed with exit code 1\n- The `eslint-plugin-turbo` test suite failed (1 failed, 10 passed, 11 total test suites)\n- Individual test failures occurred in multiple packages including `@turborepo-examples-tests/basic-yarn` and `@turborepo-examples-tests/with-svelte-yarn`\n- The testing framework generated output but did not complete the full test execution successfully\n\n**Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - PARTIAL SUCCESS**\n- Core modules were successfully imported and built (as seen in the build steps for various packages)\n- The environment was correctly configured with Node.js 22.x, pnpm, turbo, and system dependencies\n- However, the test failures indicate potential issues with core functionality in certain packages\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n- Multiple test suites failed to execute completely\n- The overall test command exited with error code 1, indicating test execution failure\n- While the environment was set up correctly, the test execution did not meet the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite finish successfully\n\nThe environment configuration succeeded in setting up the required tools and dependencies, but the test execution phase failed to meet the success criteria due to multiple test failures across different packages."
