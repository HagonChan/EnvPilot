"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The end-to-end test suite (`test:e2e:full`) executed successfully, completing with 576 passed tests out of 1473 total tests. While there were some failures, flaky tests, and skipped tests, the test suite completed execution and generated a report structure (as evidenced by the ability to view HTML reports). This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project's main functional modules were successfully imported and used during the test execution. The webpack build completed successfully (`webpack compiled successfully`), and the test suite was able to interact with core features (e.g., creating domain objects, handling notifications). This demonstrates that the core functionality is operational, meeting Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe environment configuration was successfully completed despite initial challenges with Node.js version conflicts and Playwright dependencies. The agent resolved these issues by:\n- Correctly installing Node.js 18.x after resolving version conflicts\n- Installing Playwright browsers and system dependencies\n- Successfully executing the test suite and generating coverage reports\n\nThe presence of some test failures does not constitute a failure of the environment configuration, as the success criteria focus on framework operability rather than test pass rates. The key requirements of having at least one complete test suite execution and functional core modules were both satisfied."
