"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed `cargo test --locked`, which ran multiple test suites including unit tests and doc-tests. The output shows all tests passed (e.g., \"test result: ok\" for all test groups), demonstrating the test framework completed execution and generated results.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project built successfully (`Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s)`), and core functionality was verified through:\n   - Successful compilation of all components\n   - Execution of example preprocessors (remove-emphasis, nop-preprocessor)\n   - Doc-tests verifying documentation examples work\n   - No import errors or fundamental build failures\n\nThe environment meets both success criteria despite initial installation challenges, as the final configuration allowed complete test execution and core functionality verification."
