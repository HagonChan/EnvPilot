"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite successfully executed with 321 out of 322 test suites passing, and 9,706 out of 9,733 tests passing. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, including details about the failed tests. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully, even with some individual test failures.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality of the project was verified through the successful installation of dependencies (`yarn install --frozen-lockfile`) and the execution of the test suite. The project's main modules were imported and used normally, as evidenced by the extensive test execution. The test failures were limited to specific test cases and did not indicate fundamental issues with core functionality.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful as both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) were met. The minor test failures do not invalidate the overall success, as the task criteria explicitly allow for individual test case failures as long as the suite completes and core functionality works."
