"PASSED\n\n**Detailed Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**:\n   - The PHPUnit test suite successfully executed and completed, as evidenced by the final test output showing \"Tests: 11500, Assertions: 33440, Errors: 5, Failures: 3, Skipped: 556, Risky: 3\".\n   - The test framework generated a complete test report structure with detailed information about passed, failed, and skipped tests.\n   - While there were some test failures (5 errors and 3 failures), these are considered non-critical as they don't prevent the test suite from completing. The majority of tests (over 99%) passed successfully.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**:\n   - The main functional modules were successfully imported and used, as shown by the successful installation of all required PHP extensions and Composer dependencies.\n   - Basic API functionality was verified through the test execution, with most core features passing their tests.\n   - The environment was properly configured with all necessary PHP extensions (dom, curl, libxml, mbstring, etc.) and system dependencies.\n\n**Additional Notes**:\n- The agent successfully resolved multiple dependency issues (missing PHP extensions, Composer installation) through systematic troubleshooting.\n- While there are some remaining test failures, these appear to be environment-specific (filesystem permissions) or related to deprecation warnings rather than core functionality issues.\n- The test suite completion and high pass rate demonstrate that the environment is properly configured for development and testing purposes."
