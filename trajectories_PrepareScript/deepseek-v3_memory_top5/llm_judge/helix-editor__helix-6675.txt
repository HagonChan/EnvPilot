"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed with `cargo test --workspace`, completing 115 out of 116 tests. The only failure (`test_pretty_print`) was due to a missing `ruby.so` file, which is a non-critical issue related to syntax highlighting and not core functionality. The test framework generated a complete report, meeting the success criteria for test suite execution.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules (e.g., `helix-core`, `helix-term`) were successfully imported and tested. Core features were demonstrated through the execution of numerous test cases, including text manipulation, transaction handling, and syntax parsing. The project's core functionality is operational despite the minor test failure.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful because:\n- The test suite completed execution with only one non-critical failure (related to a missing optional dependency).\n- Core modules and features are functional, as evidenced by the passing tests and successful imports.\n- The agent addressed all critical dependencies (Rust toolchain, system libraries) and demonstrated the project's core capabilities."
