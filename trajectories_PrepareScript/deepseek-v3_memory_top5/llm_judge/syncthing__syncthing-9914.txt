"PASSED\n1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The test suite completed successfully with all test cases passing. The output shows numerous test packages with \"ok\" status and execution times, indicating the test framework generated a complete test report structure.\n2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The successful test execution implies the main functional modules can be imported and used normally. The tests cover core functionality across multiple packages (api, connections, db, etc.), demonstrating the core features are operational.\n3. The agent successfully installed the required Go version (1.23.0), resolved dependencies, and configured the environment to enable cgo by installing gcc before running the tests.\n4. While there were initial setup challenges (missing Go, wget, gcc), the agent systematically resolved each issue to achieve a fully functional test environment."
