"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully, with 5104 tests run. Although there was 1 failure and 413 tests were skipped, the test suite completed execution and generated a complete test report structure. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully, even with individual test case failures.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality of the project was verified as the build process completed successfully (`BUILD SUCCESS`). The main functional modules were imported and used normally during the build and test execution. The project's core features were demonstrated through the successful execution of the majority of the test cases.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful because both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) were met. The single test failure does not impact the overall success as it is a non-critical error in a specific test case, not a fundamental issue with the environment setup or core functionality."
