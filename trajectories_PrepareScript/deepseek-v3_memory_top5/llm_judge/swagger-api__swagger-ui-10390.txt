"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The unit tests (`npm run test:unit`) completed successfully with 66 out of 69 test suites passing and 786 out of 798 tests passing. The remaining test suites and tests were skipped, which is acceptable as long as the suite completes. This meets the success criteria for test suite execution.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality was verified by successfully installing Node.js 20.x, installing project dependencies with `npm ci`, and running the unit tests. The main functional modules can be imported and used normally, and the basic API calls return expected results as demonstrated by the successful test execution.\n\nAlthough the end-to-end tests (`npm run cy:run`) could not be completed due to the server not being started within the allowed time frame, the environment configuration is still considered successful because the unit tests (a complete test suite) executed and completed successfully, and the core functionality was verified. The inability to run the end-to-end tests is not a failure condition as per the success criteria, which only require at least one complete test suite to execute successfully."
