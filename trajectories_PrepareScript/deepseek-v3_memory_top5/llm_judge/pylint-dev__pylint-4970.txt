"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite ran successfully with pytest, completing execution and generating a detailed test report. While there was 1 test failure, 1402 tests passed and 60 were skipped. The test framework executed completely, meeting the success criteria for test suite execution.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules were successfully imported and used during the test execution. The pytest framework was able to discover and run all tests, and the core functionality of the project was demonstrated through the test execution. The single test failure appears to be a specific test case issue rather than a fundamental problem with the environment setup.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria: the test suite completed execution and core functionality was verified, despite one test failure which doesn't indicate a fundamental environment problem. The agent successfully installed all dependencies, set up the virtual environment, and executed the test suite as required."
