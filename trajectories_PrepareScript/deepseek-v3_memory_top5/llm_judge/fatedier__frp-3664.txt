"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed the test suite using `make test`. The output shows that multiple test packages were run, with coverage percentages reported for each. While some packages had no test files, others had tests that all passed (e.g., `TestLoadConfigure`, `TestBandwidthQuantity`, etc.). This meets the success criterion of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent installed Go 1.21, set up the environment correctly, and installed all project dependencies using `go get ./...`. The successful execution of the test suite implies that core modules can be imported and used normally, as the tests would not run otherwise. The coverage reports further confirm that core functionality was exercised during testing.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful as both conditions are met: the test suite completed execution, and core functionality was verified through the test runs. Individual test failures (if any) were not critical, and the test framework generated a complete report structure."
