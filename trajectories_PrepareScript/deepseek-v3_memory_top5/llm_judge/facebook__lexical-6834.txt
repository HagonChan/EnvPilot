"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully ran both unit tests (`npm run test-unit`) and end-to-end tests (`npm run test-e2e-chromium`). The unit tests completed with 62 test suites passing and 1637 tests passing (2 skipped). The end-to-end tests had some failures but completed execution, generating test reports for both frameworks (Jest and Playwright).\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The environment was properly configured with Node.js 20.11.0 and npm 10.2.4 as specified in the CI/CD workflows. Dependencies were installed correctly using `npm ci`, and the project's main modules were importable and functional, as evidenced by the successful test executions. The agent also demonstrated the ability to run example test scripts from the repository.\n\nThe environment meets both success criteria despite some test failures in the end-to-end suite, as the test framework completed execution and core functionality was verified. The failures appear to be test-specific issues rather than environment configuration problems."
