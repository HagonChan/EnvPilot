"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed the test suite (`npm test`), which ran 341 Mocha tests and all passed. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, meeting Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent installed all dependencies (`npm install`) and verified that the main functional modules could be imported and used normally. The successful execution of the test suite confirms that core functionality works as expected, meeting Condition 2. \n\nThe agent resolved environment issues (Node.js/npm installation) and achieved both success criteria despite initial setup challenges. The test suite completion and core functionality verification demonstrate a successful configuration."
