"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed the test suite using `ctest`. The output shows that multiple tests were run and completed successfully, with detailed results for each test category. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully, even if some individual tests might have failed (though the output indicates all passed in this case).\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent successfully built the project using `cmake` and `make`, which demonstrates that the core functionality can be compiled and is likely functional. The ability to run tests further confirms that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally, as the tests would not execute if the core functionality was broken.\n\nThe agent followed a systematic approach to configure the environment, install dependencies, build the project, and run tests, ultimately achieving both success criteria. The environment is now properly configured for the repository."
