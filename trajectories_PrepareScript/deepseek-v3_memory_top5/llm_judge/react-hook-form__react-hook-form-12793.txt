"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite completed successfully with all 98 test suites passing. The output shows detailed test execution results with 1787 tests passed and 8 snapshots verified. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The environment was properly configured with Node.js v18.17.1 (meeting the >=18.0.0 requirement) and pnpm was installed. All dependencies were successfully installed, and the test command (`pnpm run test`) executed without any framework-level failures. The successful test execution demonstrates that core modules can be imported and used normally.\n\nThe agent successfully completed all required steps to configure the environment and verify both test execution and core functionality, meeting all success criteria."
