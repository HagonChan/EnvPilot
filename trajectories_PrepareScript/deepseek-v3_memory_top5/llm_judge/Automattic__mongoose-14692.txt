"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite (`npm test`) executed successfully, with 3534 passing tests and 48 pending. The test framework (Mocha) generated a complete test report structure, indicating that the test suite completed execution as required by Condition 1.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project's core functionality was verified by successfully installing dependencies (`npm install`) and running the test suite. The main functional modules (Mongoose) were imported and used normally, and the basic API calls returned expected results, as demonstrated by the test execution. This satisfies Condition 2.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful because both conditions are met:\n- The test suite completed execution (Condition 1).\n- Core functionality was verified (Condition 2).\n\nNote: While there were some vulnerabilities reported by `npm audit`, these do not affect the success criteria as the tests passed and core functionality was confirmed. The agent also successfully installed the required Node.js and MongoDB versions, ensuring the environment was properly configured."
