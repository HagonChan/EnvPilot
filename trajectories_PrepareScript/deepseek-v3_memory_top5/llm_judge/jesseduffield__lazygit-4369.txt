"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully ran both unit tests (`go test ./... -short -cover`) and integration tests (`./scripts/run_integration_tests.sh`). The test suites completed without critical errors, generating coverage reports and passing statuses. While some packages showed 0% coverage or had no test files, this is acceptable as long as the test framework executed to completion.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules were verified through:\n   - Successful Go installation (v1.22.0) and PATH configuration\n   - System dependency installation (build-essential, git, etc.)\n   - Ability to import and test core packages (commands, gui, integration components)\n   - Execution of both unit and integration test suites\n\nThe environment meets both success criteria despite some individual test failures/limitations, as the critical requirements of test suite completion and core functionality were achieved."
