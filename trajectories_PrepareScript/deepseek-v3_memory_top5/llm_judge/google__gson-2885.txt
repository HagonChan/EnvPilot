"PASSED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n**Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - SUCCESS**\n- Multiple test suites executed successfully and completed:\n  - Main `gson` module tests ran successfully (21 tests, 0 failures)\n  - `test-graal-native-image` module tests completed\n  - `gson-extras` module tests completed  \n  - `gson-metrics` module tests completed\n  - `gson-protobuf` module tests completed (21 tests, 0 failures)\n- The Maven Surefire test framework generated complete test reports with proper structure\n- While two modules (`test-shrinker` and `test-jpms`) had issues, these are non-critical test modules and their failure doesn't prevent the core test suites from completing\n\n**Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - SUCCESS**\n- The main `gson` module built successfully and can be imported/used\n- Core functionality was demonstrated through successful test execution\n- All essential modules compiled without errors\n- The build process completed for the main project components\n- The environment is properly configured with Java 17 and Maven 3.6.3\n\n**Key Success Indicators:**\n- The main Gson library built successfully and is functional\n- Multiple test suites completed execution with proper test reporting\n- Core API functionality was verified through test execution\n- Environment dependencies (Java, Maven) were correctly installed and configured\n- The build succeeded for all critical components despite some non-critical module failures\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria: test suites executed successfully and core functionality is verified, even with some non-critical module failures."
