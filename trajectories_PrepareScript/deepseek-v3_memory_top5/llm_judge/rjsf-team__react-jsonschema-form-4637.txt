"PASSED\n1. Test Suite Execution: The test suite (`npm test`) completed successfully after resolving initial issues. While there were some initial failures, the agent successfully rebuilt the project and re-ran the tests, resulting in all 13 projects passing. The test framework generated a complete report structure, meeting the success criteria.\n2. Core Functionality Verification: The project's main functional modules were successfully built (`npm run build`), and the test suite execution demonstrates that core functionality is working as expected. The agent also verified that dependencies were properly installed (`npm ci`), ensuring the environment is correctly configured.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria: the test suite completed successfully, and core functionality is verified to be working. The initial test failures were resolved through proper build steps, and the final test run confirmed everything is operational."
