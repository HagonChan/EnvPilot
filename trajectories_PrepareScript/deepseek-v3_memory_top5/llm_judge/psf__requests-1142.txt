"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite (`test_requests.py`) completed successfully with all 26 tests passing. The testing framework generated a complete test report structure, and the test execution finished without any framework-level errors. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality of the `requests` library was verified through:\n   - Successful installation from source (`python setup.py install`)\n   - Ability to import and use core modules (e.g., `requests.get()` worked in tests)\n   - Demonstration of basic API functionality through the test cases\n   - All test cases related to core features (authentication, headers, redirects, etc.) passed\n\nThe environment configuration was successful despite initial compatibility issues (Python 3.10 vs. older codebase), which were resolved through:\n- Updating imports for `collections.abc`\n- Fixing `HTTPConnection` initialization\n- Correcting `MockRequest` implementation\n- Properly configuring the test environment with a local `httpbin` instance\n\nThe agent successfully navigated through multiple compatibility layers and configuration challenges to achieve a fully functional environment."
