"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully with 679 passing tests. The Mocha test framework generated a complete test report structure, confirming that the test suite completed without critical failures.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules were imported and used normally, as evidenced by the successful execution of the test cases. The core features were demonstrated through the test execution, and basic API calls returned expected results.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria, as the test suite completed successfully and the core functionality was verified. The presence of some npm audit warnings does not affect the fundamental operability of the environment or the test suite."
