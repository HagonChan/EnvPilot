"PASSED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n**Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - SUCCESS**\n- The test suite completed execution successfully with 924 tests passing, 0 failing, 7 ignored, and 0 filtered out\n- The testing framework generated a complete test report structure showing all test results\n- The test execution finished in 1.71 seconds with a clear summary: \"All tests passed\"\n- Individual test failures that occurred earlier (backticks and env_var_functions) were resolved through proper environment configuration\n\n**Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - SUCCESS**\n- The Rust project compiled successfully without errors\n- All core modules and dependencies were properly installed and functional\n- The cargo build system worked correctly, downloading and compiling all required crates\n- The main executable and library components were built successfully\n\n**Key Success Indicators:**\n1. **Complete test suite execution**: 924/924 tests passed (100% success rate for executed tests)\n2. **Proper environment setup**: Rust toolchain 1.77.2, system dependencies (build-essential, ripgrep, shellcheck, libssl-dev, pkg-config, python3)\n3. **Core functionality**: The project builds and runs without fundamental errors\n4. **Test framework operability**: The cargo test framework executed start-to-finish successfully\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria - the test suite completed execution and core functionality is verified, despite initial test failures that were resolved through proper dependency installation."
