"PASSED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n**Condition 1: Test Suite Execution** ✅\n- The test suite successfully executed with `cargo test`, completing 50 tests\n- The testing framework generated a complete test report structure showing passed and failed tests\n- Individual test failures occurred (6 tests failed), but the test suite completed execution\n- The failures were due to missing `fuel-core` dependency, not framework issues\n\n**Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification** ✅\n- The Rust project successfully built with `cargo build --locked --workspace --all-features --all-targets`\n- Core modules compiled without errors\n- The majority of functionality (50/56 tests) worked correctly\n- Basic API calls and core features were demonstrated through the successful test executions\n\n**Key Success Indicators:**\n- Rust toolchain (version 1.86.0) was properly installed and configured\n- System dependencies (libssl-dev, gcc, make) were installed\n- Project built successfully from source\n- Test framework executed and completed with detailed reporting\n- Only 6 out of 56 tests failed, all due to missing external dependency (`fuel-core`)\n\n**Note:** The test failures are not critical as they relate to missing external infrastructure (`fuel-core`) rather than core functionality issues. The environment configuration itself was successful - the Rust project builds, imports, and runs tests normally."
