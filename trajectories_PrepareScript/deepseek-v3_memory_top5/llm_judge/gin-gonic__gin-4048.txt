"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite completed successfully with a coverage report showing 99.2% of statements covered. Multiple test cases were executed and passed, as evidenced by the output (e.g., `TestBasicAuth`, `TestContextFormFile`, etc.). The test framework generated a complete report structure, including coverage data (`coverage.out`).\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core modules were imported and used normally, as demonstrated by the successful execution of the test suite. The tests verified basic API calls and core features (e.g., authentication, file handling, routing). The project's main functionality was confirmed to work as expected. \n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria, despite initial challenges with tool installation (`wget`, `curl`, `make`). The agent resolved these issues and achieved a fully functional setup."
