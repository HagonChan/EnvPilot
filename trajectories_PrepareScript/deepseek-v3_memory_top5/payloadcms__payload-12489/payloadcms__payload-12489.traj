The root cause was the absence of both pnpm and npm (which could install pnpm) in the environment configuration. Standard installation via apt-get for npm faced timeouts due to environmental constraints, so the effective solution was to install pnpm directly using its official installation script.\n    - Action: curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm and its prerequisite npm were not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: Node.js and npm were missing, preventing installation of pnpm which is required for the project. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking essential JavaScript tooling. The solution involved installing Node.js via apt after resolving a dpkg interruption, then installing pnpm globally using npm.\n    - Action: apt install -y nodejs && npm install -g pnpm@9.4.0\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing Playwright browser binaries.\n    - Solution: Playwright required browser binaries (e.g., Chromium) not installed in the environment cache path. The root cause was an incomplete setup of the Playwright testing framework. Installing the browsers via Playwright's CLI resolved the issue.\n    - Action: pnpm exec playwright install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing Playwright browser binaries.\n    - Solution: Playwright required browser binaries (e.g., Chromium) not installed in the environment cache path. The root cause was an incomplete setup of the Playwright testing framework. Installing the browsers via Playwright's CLI resolved the issue.\n    - Action: pnpm exec playwright install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: 23.11.0\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: pnpm install\n  name: pnpm\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - postgresql\n  - mongodb\n  - localstack\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n- playwright\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The pnpm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The pnpm package manager was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for dependency management in Node.js projects. The root cause was the absence of both pnpm and npm (which could install pnpm) in the environment configuration. Standard installation via apt-get for npm faced timeouts due to environmental constraints, so the effective solution was to install pnpm directly using its official installation script.\n    - Action: curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm and its prerequisite npm were not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: Node.js and npm were missing, preventing installation of pnpm which is required for the project. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking essential JavaScript tooling. The solution involved installing Node.js via apt after resolving a dpkg interruption, then installing pnpm globally using npm.\n    - Action: apt install -y nodejs && npm install -g pnpm@9.4.0\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing Playwright browser binaries.\n    - Solution: Playwright required browser binaries (e.g., Chromium) not installed in the environment cache path. The root cause was an incomplete setup of the Playwright testing framework. Installing the browsers via Playwright's CLI resolved the issue.\n    - Action: pnpm exec playwright install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: 23.11.0\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: pnpm install\n  name: pnpm\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - postgresql\n  - mongodb\n  - localstack\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n- playwright\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The pnpm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The pnpm package manager was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for dependency management in Node.js projects. The root cause was the absence of both pnpm and npm (which could install pnpm) in the environment configuration. Standard installation via apt-get for npm faced timeouts due to environmental constraints, so the effective solution was to install pnpm directly using its official installation script.\n    - Action: curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm and its prerequisite npm were not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: Node.js and npm were missing, preventing installation of pnpm which is required for the project. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking essential JavaScript tooling. The solution involved installing Node.js via apt after resolving a dpkg interruption, then installing pnpm globally using npm.\n    - Action: apt install -y nodejs && npm install -g pnpm@9.4.0\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing Playwright browser binaries.\n    - Solution: Playwright required browser binaries (e.g., Chromium) not installed in the environment cache path. The root cause was an incomplete setup of the Playwright testing framework. Installing the browsers via Playwright's CLI resolved the issue.\n    - Action: pnpm exec playwright install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: 23.11.0\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: pnpm install\n  name: pnpm\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - postgresql\n  - mongodb\n  - localstack\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n- playwright\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The pnpm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The pnpm package manager was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for dependency management in Node.js projects. The root cause was the absence of both pnpm and npm (which could install pnpm) in the environment configuration. Standard installation via apt-get for npm faced timeouts due to environmental constraints, so the effective solution was to install pnpm directly using its official installation script.\n    - Action: curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm and its prerequisite npm were not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: Node.js and npm were missing, preventing installation of pnpm which is required for the project. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking essential JavaScript tooling. The solution involved installing Node.js via apt after resolving a dpkg interruption, then installing pnpm globally using npm.\n    - Action: apt install -y nodejs && npm install -g pnpm@9.4.0\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing Playwright browser binaries.\n    - Solution: Playwright required browser binaries (e.g., Chromium) not installed in the environment cache path. The root cause was an incomplete setup of the Playwright testing framework. Installing the browsers via Playwright's CLI resolved the issue.\n    - Action: pnpm exec playwright install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: 23.11.0\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: pnpm install\n  name: pnpm\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - postgresql\n  - mongodb\n  - localstack\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n- playwright\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The pnpm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The pnpm package manager was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for dependency management in Node.js projects. The root cause was the absence of both pnpm and npm (which could install pnpm) in the environment configuration. Standard installation via apt-get for npm faced timeouts due to environmental constraints, so the effective solution was to install pnpm directly using its official installation script.\n    - Action: curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm and its prerequisite npm were not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: Node.js and npm were missing, preventing installation of pnpm which is required for the project. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking essential JavaScript tooling. The solution involved installing Node.js via apt after resolving a dpkg interruption, then installing pnpm globally using npm.\n    - Action: apt install -y nodejs && npm install -g pnpm@9.4.0\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing Playwright browser binaries.\n    - Solution: Playwright required browser binaries (e.g., Chromium) not installed in the environment cache path. The root cause was an incomplete setup of the Playwright testing framework. Installing the browsers via Playwright's CLI resolved the issue.\n    - Action: pnpm exec playwright install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: 23.11.0\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: pnpm install\n  name: pnpm\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - postgresql\n  - mongodb\n  - localstack\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n- playwright\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The pnpm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The pnpm package manager was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for dependency management in Node.js projects. The root cause was the absence of both pnpm and npm (which could install pnpm) in the environment configuration. Standard installation via apt-get for npm faced timeouts due to environmental constraints, so the effective solution was to install pnpm directly using its official installation script.\n    - Action: curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm and its prerequisite npm were not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: Node.js and npm were missing, preventing installation of pnpm which is required for the project. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking essential JavaScript tooling. The solution involved installing Node.js via apt after resolving a dpkg interruption, then installing pnpm globally using npm.\n    - Action: apt install -y nodejs && npm install -g pnpm@9.4.0\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing Playwright browser binaries.\n    - Solution: Playwright required browser binaries (e.g., Chromium) not installed in the environment cache path. The root cause was an incomplete setup of the Playwright testing framework. Installing the browsers via Playwright's CLI resolved the issue.\n    - Action: pnpm exec playwright install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: 23.11.0\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: pnpm install\n  name: pnpm\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - postgresql\n  - mongodb\n  - localstack\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n- playwright\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The pnpm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The pnpm package manager was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for dependency management in Node.js projects. The root cause was the absence of both pnpm and npm (which could install pnpm) in the environment configuration. Standard installation via apt-get for npm faced timeouts due to environmental constraints, so the effective solution was to install pnpm directly using its official installation script.\n    - Action: curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm and its prerequisite npm were not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: Node.js and npm were missing, preventing installation of pnpm which is required for the project. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking essential JavaScript tooling. The solution involved installing Node.js via apt after resolving a dpkg interruption, then installing pnpm globally using npm.\n    - Action: apt install -y nodejs && npm install -g pnpm@9.4.0\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing Playwright browser binaries.\n    - Solution: Playwright required browser binaries (e.g., Chromium) not installed in the environment cache path. The root cause was an incomplete setup of the Playwright testing framework. Installing the browsers via Playwright's CLI resolved the issue.\n    - Action: pnpm exec playwright install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: 23.11.0\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: pnpm install\n  name: pnpm\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - postgresql\n  - mongodb\n  - localstack\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n- playwright\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The pnpm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The pnpm package manager was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for dependency management in Node.js projects. The root cause was the absence of both pnpm and npm (which could install pnpm) in the environment configuration. Standard installation via apt-get for npm faced timeouts due to environmental constraints, so the effective solution was to install pnpm directly using its official installation script.\n    - Action: curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm and its prerequisite npm were not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: Node.js and npm were missing, preventing installation of pnpm which is required for the project. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking essential JavaScript tooling. The solution involved installing Node.js via apt after resolving a dpkg interruption, then installing pnpm globally using npm.\n    - Action: apt install -y nodejs && npm install -g pnpm@9.4.0\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing Playwright browser binaries.\n    - Solution: Playwright required browser binaries (e.g., Chromium) not installed in the environment cache path. The root cause was an incomplete setup of the Playwright testing framework. Installing the browsers via Playwright's CLI resolved the issue.\n    - Action: pnpm exec playwright install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\",\"instance_template\":\"We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\\n\\n{{repo_related_info}}\\n\\n{{cross_repo_knowledge}}\\n\\nTASK TIPS:\\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.\",\"next_step_template\":\"{{observation}}\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"next_step_no_output_template\":\"Your command ran successfully and did not produce any output.\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"strategy_template\":null,\"demonstration_template\":null,\"success_reflection_template\":\"You are an expert code assistant who just successfully repaired a software project in an automated programming session.
