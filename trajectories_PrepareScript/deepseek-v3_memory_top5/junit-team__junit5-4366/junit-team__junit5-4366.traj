The root cause was an outdated build tool version in the project configuration. The solution was to update the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (7.6.3) that supports Java 17.\n    - Action: edit command to update distributionUrl in gradle-wrapper.properties to https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.6.3-bin.zip\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Gradle wrapper version was incompatible with the installed Java version, causing build failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the Gradle wrapper (4.4) and Java 11, which led to errors during project initialization. Updating the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (5.0) resolved the incompatibility by aligning with Java 11's requirements.\n    - Action: Edit gradle-wrapper.properties to change distributionUrl from 'gradle-4.4-all.zip' to 'gradle-5.0-all.zip'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed Gradle version was outdated and incompatible with project dependencies.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the system-installed Gradle (4.4.1) and the project's required version (\u22656.1.1). The solution was to use the project's Gradle wrapper to fetch and use the correct version.\n    - Action: ./gradlew build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle test command failed due to missing Java Development Kit (JDK).\n    - Solution: The JDK was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for Java-based projects. The root cause was the absence of Java in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing the default JDK package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Gradle build failed due to missing JDK tools.jar\n    - Solution: The Java Development Kit (JDK) was not installed, preventing compilation tasks. The root cause was an incomplete Java environment setup with only JRE present. The solution was to install the full OpenJDK 8 JDK package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The root cause was an outdated build tool version in the project configuration. The solution was to update the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (7.6.3) that supports Java 17.\n    - Action: edit command to update distributionUrl in gradle-wrapper.properties to https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.6.3-bin.zip\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Gradle wrapper version was incompatible with the installed Java version, causing build failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the Gradle wrapper (4.4) and Java 11, which led to errors during project initialization. Updating the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (5.0) resolved the incompatibility by aligning with Java 11's requirements.\n    - Action: Edit gradle-wrapper.properties to change distributionUrl from 'gradle-4.4-all.zip' to 'gradle-5.0-all.zip'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed Gradle version was outdated and incompatible with project dependencies.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the system-installed Gradle (4.4.1) and the project's required version (\u22656.1.1). The solution was to use the project's Gradle wrapper to fetch and use the correct version.\n    - Action: ./gradlew build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle test command failed due to missing Java Development Kit (JDK).\n    - Solution: The JDK was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for Java-based projects. The root cause was the absence of Java in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing the default JDK package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Gradle build failed due to missing JDK tools.jar\n    - Solution: The Java Development Kit (JDK) was not installed, preventing compilation tasks. The root cause was an incomplete Java environment setup with only JRE present. The solution was to install the full OpenJDK 8 JDK package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them.

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- Gradle\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: '21'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: build.gradle\n  install_command: ./gradlew build\n  name: Gradle\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - graphviz\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- JUnit 5\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Gradle version incompatible with the installed Java version\n    - Solution: Gradle 5.2.1 was not compatible with Java 17, causing build failures. The root cause was an outdated build tool version in the project configuration. The solution was to update the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (7.6.3) that supports Java 17.\n    - Action: edit command to update distributionUrl in gradle-wrapper.properties to https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.6.3-bin.zip\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Gradle wrapper version was incompatible with the installed Java version, causing build failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the Gradle wrapper (4.4) and Java 11, which led to errors during project initialization. Updating the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (5.0) resolved the incompatibility by aligning with Java 11's requirements.\n    - Action: Edit gradle-wrapper.properties to change distributionUrl from 'gradle-4.4-all.zip' to 'gradle-5.0-all.zip'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed Gradle version was outdated and incompatible with project dependencies.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the system-installed Gradle (4.4.1) and the project's required version (\u22656.1.1). The solution was to use the project's Gradle wrapper to fetch and use the correct version.\n    - Action: ./gradlew build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle test command failed due to missing Java Development Kit (JDK).\n    - Solution: The JDK was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for Java-based projects. The root cause was the absence of Java in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing the default JDK package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Gradle build failed due to missing JDK tools.jar\n    - Solution: The Java Development Kit (JDK) was not installed, preventing compilation tasks. The root cause was an incomplete Java environment setup with only JRE present. The solution was to install the full OpenJDK 8 JDK package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file).

Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to update the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (7.6.3) that supports Java 17.\n    - Action: edit command to update distributionUrl in gradle-wrapper.properties to https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.6.3-bin.zip\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Gradle wrapper version was incompatible with the installed Java version, causing build failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the Gradle wrapper (4.4) and Java 11, which led to errors during project initialization. Updating the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (5.0) resolved the incompatibility by aligning with Java 11's requirements.\n    - Action: Edit gradle-wrapper.properties to change distributionUrl from 'gradle-4.4-all.zip' to 'gradle-5.0-all.zip'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed Gradle version was outdated and incompatible with project dependencies.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the system-installed Gradle (4.4.1) and the project's required version (\u22656.1.1). The solution was to use the project's Gradle wrapper to fetch and use the correct version.\n    - Action: ./gradlew build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle test command failed due to missing Java Development Kit (JDK).\n    - Solution: The JDK was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for Java-based projects. The root cause was the absence of Java in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing the default JDK package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Gradle build failed due to missing JDK tools.jar\n    - Solution: The Java Development Kit (JDK) was not installed, preventing compilation tasks. The root cause was an incomplete Java environment setup with only JRE present. The solution was to install the full OpenJDK 8 JDK package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT!

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- Gradle\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: '21'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: build.gradle\n  install_command: ./gradlew build\n  name: Gradle\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - graphviz\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- JUnit 5\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Gradle version incompatible with the installed Java version\n    - Solution: Gradle 5.2.1 was not compatible with Java 17, causing build failures. The root cause was an outdated build tool version in the project configuration. The solution was to update the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (7.6.3) that supports Java 17.\n    - Action: edit command to update distributionUrl in gradle-wrapper.properties to https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.6.3-bin.zip\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Gradle wrapper version was incompatible with the installed Java version, causing build failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the Gradle wrapper (4.4) and Java 11, which led to errors during project initialization. Updating the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (5.0) resolved the incompatibility by aligning with Java 11's requirements.\n    - Action: Edit gradle-wrapper.properties to change distributionUrl from 'gradle-4.4-all.zip' to 'gradle-5.0-all.zip'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed Gradle version was outdated and incompatible with project dependencies.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the system-installed Gradle (4.4.1) and the project's required version (\u22656.1.1). The solution was to use the project's Gradle wrapper to fetch and use the correct version.\n    - Action: ./gradlew build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle test command failed due to missing Java Development Kit (JDK).\n    - Solution: The JDK was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for Java-based projects. The root cause was the absence of Java in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing the default JDK package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Gradle build failed due to missing JDK tools.jar\n    - Solution: The Java Development Kit (JDK) was not installed, preventing compilation tasks. The root cause was an incomplete Java environment setup with only JRE present. The solution was to install the full OpenJDK 8 JDK package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- Gradle\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: '21'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: build.gradle\n  install_command: ./gradlew build\n  name: Gradle\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - graphviz\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- JUnit 5\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Gradle version incompatible with the installed Java version\n    - Solution: Gradle 5.2.1 was not compatible with Java 17, causing build failures. The root cause was an outdated build tool version in the project configuration. The solution was to update the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (7.6.3) that supports Java 17.\n    - Action: edit command to update distributionUrl in gradle-wrapper.properties to https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.6.3-bin.zip\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Gradle wrapper version was incompatible with the installed Java version, causing build failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the Gradle wrapper (4.4) and Java 11, which led to errors during project initialization. Updating the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (5.0) resolved the incompatibility by aligning with Java 11's requirements.\n    - Action: Edit gradle-wrapper.properties to change distributionUrl from 'gradle-4.4-all.zip' to 'gradle-5.0-all.zip'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed Gradle version was outdated and incompatible with project dependencies.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the system-installed Gradle (4.4.1) and the project's required version (\u22656.1.1). The solution was to use the project's Gradle wrapper to fetch and use the correct version.\n    - Action: ./gradlew build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle test command failed due to missing Java Development Kit (JDK).\n    - Solution: The JDK was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for Java-based projects. The root cause was the absence of Java in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing the default JDK package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Gradle build failed due to missing JDK tools.jar\n    - Solution: The Java Development Kit (JDK) was not installed, preventing compilation tasks. The root cause was an incomplete Java environment setup with only JRE present. The solution was to install the full OpenJDK 8 JDK package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- Gradle\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: '21'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: build.gradle\n  install_command: ./gradlew build\n  name: Gradle\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - graphviz\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- JUnit 5\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Gradle version incompatible with the installed Java version\n    - Solution: Gradle 5.2.1 was not compatible with Java 17, causing build failures. The root cause was an outdated build tool version in the project configuration. The solution was to update the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (7.6.3) that supports Java 17.\n    - Action: edit command to update distributionUrl in gradle-wrapper.properties to https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.6.3-bin.zip\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Gradle wrapper version was incompatible with the installed Java version, causing build failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the Gradle wrapper (4.4) and Java 11, which led to errors during project initialization. Updating the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (5.0) resolved the incompatibility by aligning with Java 11's requirements.\n    - Action: Edit gradle-wrapper.properties to change distributionUrl from 'gradle-4.4-all.zip' to 'gradle-5.0-all.zip'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed Gradle version was outdated and incompatible with project dependencies.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the system-installed Gradle (4.4.1) and the project's required version (\u22656.1.1). The solution was to use the project's Gradle wrapper to fetch and use the correct version.\n    - Action: ./gradlew build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle test command failed due to missing Java Development Kit (JDK).\n    - Solution: The JDK was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for Java-based projects. The root cause was the absence of Java in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing the default JDK package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Gradle build failed due to missing JDK tools.jar\n    - Solution: The Java Development Kit (JDK) was not installed, preventing compilation tasks. The root cause was an incomplete Java environment setup with only JRE present. The solution was to install the full OpenJDK 8 JDK package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- Gradle\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: '21'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: build.gradle\n  install_command: ./gradlew build\n  name: Gradle\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - graphviz\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- JUnit 5\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Gradle version incompatible with the installed Java version\n    - Solution: Gradle 5.2.1 was not compatible with Java 17, causing build failures. The root cause was an outdated build tool version in the project configuration. The solution was to update the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (7.6.3) that supports Java 17.\n    - Action: edit command to update distributionUrl in gradle-wrapper.properties to https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.6.3-bin.zip\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Gradle wrapper version was incompatible with the installed Java version, causing build failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the Gradle wrapper (4.4) and Java 11, which led to errors during project initialization. Updating the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (5.0) resolved the incompatibility by aligning with Java 11's requirements.\n    - Action: Edit gradle-wrapper.properties to change distributionUrl from 'gradle-4.4-all.zip' to 'gradle-5.0-all.zip'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed Gradle version was outdated and incompatible with project dependencies.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the system-installed Gradle (4.4.1) and the project's required version (\u22656.1.1). The solution was to use the project's Gradle wrapper to fetch and use the correct version.\n    - Action: ./gradlew build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle test command failed due to missing Java Development Kit (JDK).\n    - Solution: The JDK was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for Java-based projects. The root cause was the absence of Java in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing the default JDK package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Gradle build failed due to missing JDK tools.jar\n    - Solution: The Java Development Kit (JDK) was not installed, preventing compilation tasks. The root cause was an incomplete Java environment setup with only JRE present. The solution was to install the full OpenJDK 8 JDK package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- Gradle\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: '21'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: build.gradle\n  install_command: ./gradlew build\n  name: Gradle\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - graphviz\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- JUnit 5\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Gradle version incompatible with the installed Java version\n    - Solution: Gradle 5.2.1 was not compatible with Java 17, causing build failures. The root cause was an outdated build tool version in the project configuration. The solution was to update the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (7.6.3) that supports Java 17.\n    - Action: edit command to update distributionUrl in gradle-wrapper.properties to https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.6.3-bin.zip\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Gradle wrapper version was incompatible with the installed Java version, causing build failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the Gradle wrapper (4.4) and Java 11, which led to errors during project initialization. Updating the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (5.0) resolved the incompatibility by aligning with Java 11's requirements.\n    - Action: Edit gradle-wrapper.properties to change distributionUrl from 'gradle-4.4-all.zip' to 'gradle-5.0-all.zip'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed Gradle version was outdated and incompatible with project dependencies.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the system-installed Gradle (4.4.1) and the project's required version (\u22656.1.1). The solution was to use the project's Gradle wrapper to fetch and use the correct version.\n    - Action: ./gradlew build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle test command failed due to missing Java Development Kit (JDK).\n    - Solution: The JDK was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for Java-based projects. The root cause was the absence of Java in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing the default JDK package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Gradle build failed due to missing JDK tools.jar\n    - Solution: The Java Development Kit (JDK) was not installed, preventing compilation tasks. The root cause was an incomplete Java environment setup with only JRE present. The solution was to install the full OpenJDK 8 JDK package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- Gradle\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: '21'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: build.gradle\n  install_command: ./gradlew build\n  name: Gradle\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - graphviz\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- JUnit 5\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Gradle version incompatible with the installed Java version\n    - Solution: Gradle 5.2.1 was not compatible with Java 17, causing build failures. The root cause was an outdated build tool version in the project configuration. The solution was to update the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (7.6.3) that supports Java 17.\n    - Action: edit command to update distributionUrl in gradle-wrapper.properties to https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.6.3-bin.zip\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Gradle wrapper version was incompatible with the installed Java version, causing build failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the Gradle wrapper (4.4) and Java 11, which led to errors during project initialization. Updating the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (5.0) resolved the incompatibility by aligning with Java 11's requirements.\n    - Action: Edit gradle-wrapper.properties to change distributionUrl from 'gradle-4.4-all.zip' to 'gradle-5.0-all.zip'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed Gradle version was outdated and incompatible with project dependencies.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the system-installed Gradle (4.4.1) and the project's required version (\u22656.1.1). The solution was to use the project's Gradle wrapper to fetch and use the correct version.\n    - Action: ./gradlew build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle test command failed due to missing Java Development Kit (JDK).\n    - Solution: The JDK was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for Java-based projects. The root cause was the absence of Java in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing the default JDK package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Gradle build failed due to missing JDK tools.jar\n    - Solution: The Java Development Kit (JDK) was not installed, preventing compilation tasks. The root cause was an incomplete Java environment setup with only JRE present. The solution was to install the full OpenJDK 8 JDK package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- Gradle\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: '21'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: build.gradle\n  install_command: ./gradlew build\n  name: Gradle\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - graphviz\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- JUnit 5\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Gradle version incompatible with the installed Java version\n    - Solution: Gradle 5.2.1 was not compatible with Java 17, causing build failures. The root cause was an outdated build tool version in the project configuration. The solution was to update the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (7.6.3) that supports Java 17.\n    - Action: edit command to update distributionUrl in gradle-wrapper.properties to https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.6.3-bin.zip\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Gradle wrapper version was incompatible with the installed Java version, causing build failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the Gradle wrapper (4.4) and Java 11, which led to errors during project initialization. Updating the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (5.0) resolved the incompatibility by aligning with Java 11's requirements.\n    - Action: Edit gradle-wrapper.properties to change distributionUrl from 'gradle-4.4-all.zip' to 'gradle-5.0-all.zip'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed Gradle version was outdated and incompatible with project dependencies.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the system-installed Gradle (4.4.1) and the project's required version (\u22656.1.1). The solution was to use the project's Gradle wrapper to fetch and use the correct version.\n    - Action: ./gradlew build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle test command failed due to missing Java Development Kit (JDK).\n    - Solution: The JDK was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for Java-based projects. The root cause was the absence of Java in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing the default JDK package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Gradle build failed due to missing JDK tools.jar\n    - Solution: The Java Development Kit (JDK) was not installed, preventing compilation tasks. The root cause was an incomplete Java environment setup with only JRE present. The solution was to install the full OpenJDK 8 JDK package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- Gradle\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: '21'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: build.gradle\n  install_command: ./gradlew build\n  name: Gradle\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - graphviz\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- JUnit 5\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Gradle version incompatible with the installed Java version\n    - Solution: Gradle 5.2.1 was not compatible with Java 17, causing build failures. The root cause was an outdated build tool version in the project configuration. The solution was to update the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (7.6.3) that supports Java 17.\n    - Action: edit command to update distributionUrl in gradle-wrapper.properties to https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.6.3-bin.zip\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Gradle wrapper version was incompatible with the installed Java version, causing build failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the Gradle wrapper (4.4) and Java 11, which led to errors during project initialization. Updating the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (5.0) resolved the incompatibility by aligning with Java 11's requirements.\n    - Action: Edit gradle-wrapper.properties to change distributionUrl from 'gradle-4.4-all.zip' to 'gradle-5.0-all.zip'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed Gradle version was outdated and incompatible with project dependencies.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the system-installed Gradle (4.4.1) and the project's required version (\u22656.1.1). The solution was to use the project's Gradle wrapper to fetch and use the correct version.\n    - Action: ./gradlew build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle test command failed due to missing Java Development Kit (JDK).\n    - Solution: The JDK was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for Java-based projects. The root cause was the absence of Java in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing the default JDK package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Gradle build failed due to missing JDK tools.jar\n    - Solution: The Java Development Kit (JDK) was not installed, preventing compilation tasks. The root cause was an incomplete Java environment setup with only JRE present. The solution was to install the full OpenJDK 8 JDK package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Updating the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (5.0) resolved the incompatibility by aligning with Java 11's requirements.\n    - Action: Edit gradle-wrapper.properties to change distributionUrl from 'gradle-4.4-all.zip' to 'gradle-5.0-all.zip'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed Gradle version was outdated and incompatible with project dependencies.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the system-installed Gradle (4.4.1) and the project's required version (\u22656.1.1). The solution was to use the project's Gradle wrapper to fetch and use the correct version.\n    - Action: ./gradlew build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle test command failed due to missing Java Development Kit (JDK).\n    - Solution: The JDK was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for Java-based projects. The root cause was the absence of Java in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing the default JDK package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Gradle build failed due to missing JDK tools.jar\n    - Solution: The Java Development Kit (JDK) was not installed, preventing compilation tasks. The root cause was an incomplete Java environment setup with only JRE present. The solution was to install the full OpenJDK 8 JDK package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- Gradle\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: '21'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: build.gradle\n  install_command: ./gradlew build\n  name: Gradle\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - graphviz\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- JUnit 5\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Gradle version incompatible with the installed Java version\n    - Solution: Gradle 5.2.1 was not compatible with Java 17, causing build failures. The root cause was an outdated build tool version in the project configuration. The solution was to update the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (7.6.3) that supports Java 17.\n    - Action: edit command to update distributionUrl in gradle-wrapper.properties to https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.6.3-bin.zip\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Gradle wrapper version was incompatible with the installed Java version, causing build failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the Gradle wrapper (4.4) and Java 11, which led to errors during project initialization. Updating the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (5.0) resolved the incompatibility by aligning with Java 11's requirements.\n    - Action: Edit gradle-wrapper.properties to change distributionUrl from 'gradle-4.4-all.zip' to 'gradle-5.0-all.zip'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed Gradle version was outdated and incompatible with project dependencies.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the system-installed Gradle (4.4.1) and the project's required version (\u22656.1.1). The solution was to use the project's Gradle wrapper to fetch and use the correct version.\n    - Action: ./gradlew build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle test command failed due to missing Java Development Kit (JDK).\n    - Solution: The JDK was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for Java-based projects. The root cause was the absence of Java in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing the default JDK package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Gradle build failed due to missing JDK tools.jar\n    - Solution: The Java Development Kit (JDK) was not installed, preventing compilation tasks. The root cause was an incomplete Java environment setup with only JRE present. The solution was to install the full OpenJDK 8 JDK package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- Gradle\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: '21'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: build.gradle\n  install_command: ./gradlew build\n  name: Gradle\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - graphviz\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- JUnit 5\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Gradle version incompatible with the installed Java version\n    - Solution: Gradle 5.2.1 was not compatible with Java 17, causing build failures. The root cause was an outdated build tool version in the project configuration. The solution was to update the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (7.6.3) that supports Java 17.\n    - Action: edit command to update distributionUrl in gradle-wrapper.properties to https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.6.3-bin.zip\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Gradle wrapper version was incompatible with the installed Java version, causing build failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the Gradle wrapper (4.4) and Java 11, which led to errors during project initialization. Updating the Gradle wrapper to a compatible version (5.0) resolved the incompatibility by aligning with Java 11's requirements.\n    - Action: Edit gradle-wrapper.properties to change distributionUrl from 'gradle-4.4-all.zip' to 'gradle-5.0-all.zip'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed Gradle version was outdated and incompatible with project dependencies.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch between the system-installed Gradle (4.4.1) and the project's required version (\u22656.1.1). The solution was to use the project's Gradle wrapper to fetch and use the correct version.\n    - Action: ./gradlew build\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial Gradle test command failed due to missing Java Development Kit (JDK).\n    - Solution: The JDK was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is required for Java-based projects. The root cause was the absence of Java in the environment configuration. The solution involved installing the default JDK package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jdk\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Gradle build failed due to missing JDK tools.jar\n    - Solution: The Java Development Kit (JDK) was not installed, preventing compilation tasks. The root cause was an incomplete Java environment setup with only JRE present. The solution was to install the full OpenJDK 8 JDK package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\",\"instance_template\":\"We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\\n\\n{{repo_related_info}}\\n\\n{{cross_repo_knowledge}}\\n\\nTASK TIPS:\\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\\n4.
