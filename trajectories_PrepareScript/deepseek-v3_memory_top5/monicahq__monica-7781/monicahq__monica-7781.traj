          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

It\u2019s actually pretty dumb: it will only send you emails for the things you asked to be reminded of.\n89:- Monica does not have built-in AI with integrations like ChatGPT.\n90:- Monica is not a tool that will scan your data and do nasty things with it. It\u2019s your data, your server, do whatever you want with it. You\u2019re in control of your data.\n91:\n92:## Contribute\n93:\n94:Do you want to lend a hand? That\u2019s great!

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

It\u2019s actually pretty dumb: it will only send you emails for the things you asked to be reminded of.\n89:- Monica does not have built-in AI with integrations like ChatGPT.\n90:- Monica is not a tool that will scan your data and do nasty things with it. It\u2019s your data, your server, do whatever you want with it. You\u2019re in control of your data.\n91:\n92:## Contribute\n93:\n94:Do you want to lend a hand? That\u2019s great!

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

We call it a PRM, or Personal Relationship Management. Imagine a CRM\u2014a commonly used tool by sales teams in the corporate world\u2014for your friends and family.\n53:\n54:### Features\n55:\n56:- Add and manage contacts\n57:- Define relationships between contacts\n58:- Reminders\n59:- Automatic reminders for birthdays\n60:- Ability to add notes to a contact\n61:- Ability to record how you met someone\n62:- Management of activities with a contact\n63:- Management of tasks\n64:- Management of addresses and all the different ways to contact someone\n65:- Management of contact field types\n66:- Management of a contact\u2019s pets\n67:- Top of the art diary to keep track of what\u2019s happening in your life\n68:- Ability to record how your day went\n69:- Upload documents and photos\n70:- Ability to define custom genders\n71:- Ability to define custom activity types\n72:- Ability to favorite contacts\n73:- Multiple vaults and users\n74:- Labels to organize contacts\n75:- Ability to define what section should appear on the contact sheet\n76:- Multiple currencies\n77:- Translated in 27 languages\n78:\n79:### Who is it for?\n80:\n81:This project is for people who want to document their lives and those who have difficulty remembering details about the lives of people they care about.\n82:\n83:We\u2019ve also had a lot of positive reviews from people with Asperger syndrome, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and introverts who use our app every day.\n84:\n85:### What Monica isn\u2019t\n86:\n87:- Monica is not a social network and **it never will be**. It\u2019s not meant to be social. It\u2019s designed to be the opposite: it\u2019s for your eyes only.\n88:- Monica is not a smart assistant. It won\u2019t guess what you want to do. It\u2019s actually pretty dumb: it will only send you emails for the things you asked to be reminded of.\n89:- Monica does not have built-in AI with integrations like ChatGPT.\n90:- Monica is not a tool that will scan your data and do nasty things with it. It\u2019s your data, your server, do whatever you want with it. You\u2019re in control of your data.\n91:\n92:## Contribute\n93:\n94:Do you want to lend a hand? That\u2019s great! We accept contributions from everyone, regardless of form.\n95:\n96:Here are some of the things you can do to help.\n97:\n98:### Contribute as a community\n99:\n100:- Unlike Fight Club, the best way to help is **to actually talk about Monica** as much as you can in blog posts and articles, or on social media.\n(84 more lines below)\n\n(Open file: /testbed/README.md)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

We call it a PRM, or Personal Relationship Management. Imagine a CRM\u2014a commonly used tool by sales teams in the corporate world\u2014for your friends and family.\n53:\n54:### Features\n55:\n56:- Add and manage contacts\n57:- Define relationships between contacts\n58:- Reminders\n59:- Automatic reminders for birthdays\n60:- Ability to add notes to a contact\n61:- Ability to record how you met someone\n62:- Management of activities with a contact\n63:- Management of tasks\n64:- Management of addresses and all the different ways to contact someone\n65:- Management of contact field types\n66:- Management of a contact\u2019s pets\n67:- Top of the art diary to keep track of what\u2019s happening in your life\n68:- Ability to record how your day went\n69:- Upload documents and photos\n70:- Ability to define custom genders\n71:- Ability to define custom activity types\n72:- Ability to favorite contacts\n73:- Multiple vaults and users\n74:- Labels to organize contacts\n75:- Ability to define what section should appear on the contact sheet\n76:- Multiple currencies\n77:- Translated in 27 languages\n78:\n79:### Who is it for?\n80:\n81:This project is for people who want to document their lives and those who have difficulty remembering details about the lives of people they care about.\n82:\n83:We\u2019ve also had a lot of positive reviews from people with Asperger syndrome, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and introverts who use our app every day.\n84:\n85:### What Monica isn\u2019t\n86:\n87:- Monica is not a social network and **it never will be**. It\u2019s not meant to be social. It\u2019s designed to be the opposite: it\u2019s for your eyes only.\n88:- Monica is not a smart assistant. It won\u2019t guess what you want to do. It\u2019s actually pretty dumb: it will only send you emails for the things you asked to be reminded of.\n89:- Monica does not have built-in AI with integrations like ChatGPT.\n90:- Monica is not a tool that will scan your data and do nasty things with it. It\u2019s your data, your server, do whatever you want with it. You\u2019re in control of your data.\n91:\n92:## Contribute\n93:\n94:Do you want to lend a hand? That\u2019s great! We accept contributions from everyone, regardless of form.\n95:\n96:Here are some of the things you can do to help.\n97:\n98:### Contribute as a community\n99:\n100:- Unlike Fight Club, the best way to help is **to actually talk about Monica** as much as you can in blog posts and articles, or on social media.\n(84 more lines below)\n\n(Open file: /testbed/README.md)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

We call it a PRM, or Personal Relationship Management. Imagine a CRM\u2014a commonly used tool by sales teams in the corporate world\u2014for your friends and family.\n53:\n54:### Features\n55:\n56:- Add and manage contacts\n57:- Define relationships between contacts\n58:- Reminders\n59:- Automatic reminders for birthdays\n60:- Ability to add notes to a contact\n61:- Ability to record how you met someone\n62:- Management of activities with a contact\n63:- Management of tasks\n64:- Management of addresses and all the different ways to contact someone\n65:- Management of contact field types\n66:- Management of a contact\u2019s pets\n67:- Top of the art diary to keep track of what\u2019s happening in your life\n68:- Ability to record how your day went\n69:- Upload documents and photos\n70:- Ability to define custom genders\n71:- Ability to define custom activity types\n72:- Ability to favorite contacts\n73:- Multiple vaults and users\n74:- Labels to organize contacts\n75:- Ability to define what section should appear on the contact sheet\n76:- Multiple currencies\n77:- Translated in 27 languages\n78:\n79:### Who is it for?\n80:\n81:This project is for people who want to document their lives and those who have difficulty remembering details about the lives of people they care about.\n82:\n83:We\u2019ve also had a lot of positive reviews from people with Asperger syndrome, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and introverts who use our app every day.\n84:\n85:### What Monica isn\u2019t\n86:\n87:- Monica is not a social network and **it never will be**. It\u2019s not meant to be social. It\u2019s designed to be the opposite: it\u2019s for your eyes only.\n88:- Monica is not a smart assistant. It won\u2019t guess what you want to do. It\u2019s actually pretty dumb: it will only send you emails for the things you asked to be reminded of.\n89:- Monica does not have built-in AI with integrations like ChatGPT.\n90:- Monica is not a tool that will scan your data and do nasty things with it. It\u2019s your data, your server, do whatever you want with it. You\u2019re in control of your data.\n91:\n92:## Contribute\n93:\n94:Do you want to lend a hand? That\u2019s great! We accept contributions from everyone, regardless of form.\n95:\n96:Here are some of the things you can do to help.\n97:\n98:### Contribute as a community\n99:\n100:- Unlike Fight Club, the best way to help is **to actually talk about Monica** as much as you can in blog posts and articles, or on social media.\n(84 more lines below)\n\n(Open file: /testbed/README.md)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

We call it a PRM, or Personal Relationship Management. Imagine a CRM\u2014a commonly used tool by sales teams in the corporate world\u2014for your friends and family.\n53:\n54:### Features\n55:\n56:- Add and manage contacts\n57:- Define relationships between contacts\n58:- Reminders\n59:- Automatic reminders for birthdays\n60:- Ability to add notes to a contact\n61:- Ability to record how you met someone\n62:- Management of activities with a contact\n63:- Management of tasks\n64:- Management of addresses and all the different ways to contact someone\n65:- Management of contact field types\n66:- Management of a contact\u2019s pets\n67:- Top of the art diary to keep track of what\u2019s happening in your life\n68:- Ability to record how your day went\n69:- Upload documents and photos\n70:- Ability to define custom genders\n71:- Ability to define custom activity types\n72:- Ability to favorite contacts\n73:- Multiple vaults and users\n74:- Labels to organize contacts\n75:- Ability to define what section should appear on the contact sheet\n76:- Multiple currencies\n77:- Translated in 27 languages\n78:\n79:### Who is it for?\n80:\n81:This project is for people who want to document their lives and those who have difficulty remembering details about the lives of people they care about.\n82:\n83:We\u2019ve also had a lot of positive reviews from people with Asperger syndrome, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and introverts who use our app every day.\n84:\n85:### What Monica isn\u2019t\n86:\n87:- Monica is not a social network and **it never will be**. It\u2019s not meant to be social. It\u2019s designed to be the opposite: it\u2019s for your eyes only.\n88:- Monica is not a smart assistant. It won\u2019t guess what you want to do. It\u2019s actually pretty dumb: it will only send you emails for the things you asked to be reminded of.\n89:- Monica does not have built-in AI with integrations like ChatGPT.\n90:- Monica is not a tool that will scan your data and do nasty things with it. It\u2019s your data, your server, do whatever you want with it. You\u2019re in control of your data.\n91:\n92:## Contribute\n93:\n94:Do you want to lend a hand? That\u2019s great! We accept contributions from everyone, regardless of form.\n95:\n96:Here are some of the things you can do to help.\n97:\n98:### Contribute as a community\n99:\n100:- Unlike Fight Club, the best way to help is **to actually talk about Monica** as much as you can in blog posts and articles, or on social media.\n(84 more lines below)\n\n(Open file: /testbed/README.md)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Install PHP 8.3 and required extensions (`php-mysql`, `php-pgsql`, `sqlite`).\n2. Install Node.js (version 22).\n3. Install Composer if not already installed.\n4. Run `composer install` to install dependencies.\n5. Run the tests using PHPUnit.\n\nLet's start by installing PHP 8.3 and the required extensions.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Install PHP 8.3 and required extensions (`php-mysql`, `php-pgsql`, `sqlite`).\n2. Install Node.js (version 22).\n3. Install Composer if not already installed.\n4. Run `composer install` to install dependencies.\n5. Run the tests using PHPUnit.\n\nLet's start by installing PHP 8.3 and the required extensions.",

      "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer install\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - php\n  - php-mysql\n  - php-pgsql\n  - sqlite\n  - nodejs\n  - npm\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed due to externally managed environment restrictions.\n    - Solution: System policies blocked global Python package installation to prevent conflicts. The root cause was the OS enforcing virtual environments for package management. The solution was creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n    - Action: python3.11 -m venv .venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.9 was unavailable in the system package repositories\n    - Solution: The base Docker image's default repositories did not provide Python 3.9 packages. The root cause was the absence of compatible packages in the configured repositories. The solution was to install pyenv to manage Python versions and build Python 3.9 from source, requiring installation of build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git && git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv && echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc && echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\" && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

We call it a PRM, or Personal Relationship Management. Imagine a CRM\u2014a commonly used tool by sales teams in the corporate world\u2014for your friends and family.\n53:\n54:### Features\n55:\n56:- Add and manage contacts\n57:- Define relationships between contacts\n58:- Reminders\n59:- Automatic reminders for birthdays\n60:- Ability to add notes to a contact\n61:- Ability to record how you met someone\n62:- Management of activities with a contact\n63:- Management of tasks\n64:- Management of addresses and all the different ways to contact someone\n65:- Management of contact field types\n66:- Management of a contact\u2019s pets\n67:- Top of the art diary to keep track of what\u2019s happening in your life\n68:- Ability to record how your day went\n69:- Upload documents and photos\n70:- Ability to define custom genders\n71:- Ability to define custom activity types\n72:- Ability to favorite contacts\n73:- Multiple vaults and users\n74:- Labels to organize contacts\n75:- Ability to define what section should appear on the contact sheet\n76:- Multiple currencies\n77:- Translated in 27 languages\n78:\n79:### Who is it for?\n80:\n81:This project is for people who want to document their lives and those who have difficulty remembering details about the lives of people they care about.\n82:\n83:We\u2019ve also had a lot of positive reviews from people with Asperger syndrome, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and introverts who use our app every day.\n84:\n85:### What Monica isn\u2019t\n86:\n87:- Monica is not a social network and **it never will be**. It\u2019s not meant to be social. It\u2019s designed to be the opposite: it\u2019s for your eyes only.\n88:- Monica is not a smart assistant. It won\u2019t guess what you want to do. It\u2019s actually pretty dumb: it will only send you emails for the things you asked to be reminded of.\n89:- Monica does not have built-in AI with integrations like ChatGPT.\n90:- Monica is not a tool that will scan your data and do nasty things with it. It\u2019s your data, your server, do whatever you want with it. You\u2019re in control of your data.\n91:\n92:## Contribute\n93:\n94:Do you want to lend a hand? That\u2019s great!

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\",\"instance_template\":\"We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\\n\\n{{repo_related_info}}\\n\\n{{cross_repo_knowledge}}\\n\\nTASK TIPS:\\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.\",\"next_step_template\":\"{{observation}}\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"next_step_no_output_template\":\"Your command ran successfully and did not produce any output.\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"strategy_template\":null,\"demonstration_template\":null,\"success_reflection_template\":\"You are an expert code assistant who just successfully repaired a software project in an automated programming session.
