Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cargo\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - make\n  - pkg-config\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- cargo test\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n    - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cargo\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - make\n  - pkg-config\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- cargo test\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n    - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cargo\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - make\n  - pkg-config\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- cargo test\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n    - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cargo\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - make\n  - pkg-config\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- cargo test\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n    - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cargo\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - make\n  - pkg-config\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- cargo test\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n    - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cargo\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - make\n  - pkg-config\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- cargo test\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n    - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cargo\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - make\n  - pkg-config\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- cargo test\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n    - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Here's what I've gathered:\n\n1. **System Dependencies**:\n   - For Linux, the workflow installs `libmysqlclient-dev`, `libpq-dev`, and `libsqlite3-dev` using `apt-get`.\n   - For macOS, it uses `brew` to install `mysql-client`, `libpq`, and `sqlite`.\n   - For Windows, it uses `vcpkg` to install native dependencies.\n\n2. **Rust Installation**:\n   - The workflow uses `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@master` to install the Rust toolchain, including `stable` and `nightly` versions.\n\n3. **Test Execution**:\n   - Tests are run using `cargo test` with various flags (`--examples`, `--contrib`, `--core`, etc.).\n\n### Next Steps:\nBased on this, I'll proceed to:\n1. Install the required system dependencies for Linux (`libmysqlclient-dev`, `libpq-dev`, `libsqlite3-dev`).\n2. Install the Rust toolchain using `rustup`.\n3. Run `cargo test` to execute the tests.\n\nI'll start by installing the system dependencies.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cargo\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - make\n  - pkg-config\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- cargo test\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n    - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cargo\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - make\n  - pkg-config\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- cargo test\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n    - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cargo\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - make\n  - pkg-config\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- cargo test\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n    - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cargo\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - make\n  - pkg-config\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- cargo test\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n    - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cargo\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - make\n  - pkg-config\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- cargo test\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n    - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cargo\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - make\n  - pkg-config\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- cargo test\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n    - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cargo\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - make\n  - pkg-config\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- cargo test\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n    - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

      "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cargo\nlanguage:\n  name: Rust\n  version_constraint: stable, nightly\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: Cargo.toml\n  install_command: cargo build\n  name: cargo\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - libmysqlclient-dev\n  - libpq-dev\n  - libsqlite3-dev\n  likely_required:\n  - gcc\n  - make\n  - pkg-config\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- cargo test\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Compilation errors occurred during cargo test due to missing system dependencies.\n    - Solution: Required development packages such as libssl-dev, clang, and pkg-config were not installed, which are necessary for compiling Rust crates that depend on native libraries. The root cause was an insufficient environment setup for build tools. The solution was to identify the dependencies from project configuration files (e.g., Cross.toml) and install them using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev clang pkg-config\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The Rust toolchain (cargo) was not installed, preventing project building and testing\n    - Solution: The Rust development environment was absent, which is required for compiling and testing Rust projects. The root cause was a missing language toolchain in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Rust using the official rustup installer script via curl.\n    - Action: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing OpenSSL development libraries caused linker errors during test execution\n    - Solution: The project's cryptographic functionality required OpenSSL development headers and libraries. The root cause was incomplete cryptographic toolchain installation. The solution was to install the OpenSSL development package.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\",\"instance_template\":\"We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\\n\\n{{repo_related_info}}\\n\\n{{cross_repo_knowledge}}\\n\\nTASK TIPS:\\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.\",\"next_step_template\":\"{{observation}}\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"next_step_no_output_template\":\"Your command ran successfully and did not produce any output.\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"strategy_template\":null,\"demonstration_template\":null,\"success_reflection_template\":\"You are an expert code assistant who just successfully repaired a software project in an automated programming session.
