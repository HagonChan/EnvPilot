Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4.

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

      "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\",\"instance_template\":\"We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\\n\\n{{repo_related_info}}\\n\\n{{cross_repo_knowledge}}\\n\\nTASK TIPS:\\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.\",\"next_step_template\":\"{{observation}}\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"next_step_no_output_template\":\"Your command ran successfully and did not produce any output.\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"strategy_template\":null,\"demonstration_template\":null,\"success_reflection_template\":\"You are an expert code assistant who just successfully repaired a software project in an automated programming session.
