The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them.

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

They assume that you have installed Git (and Cygwin, MSYS2 or WSL if\n7:running on Windows), and want to clone the main-line JDK repository.\n8:\n9: 1. [Get the complete source code](#getting-the-source-code): \\\n10:    `git clone https://git.openjdk.org/jdk`\n11:\n12: 2. [Run configure](#running-configure): \\\n13:    `bash configure`\n14:\n15:    If `configure` fails due to missing dependencies (to either the\n16:    [toolchain](#native-compiler-toolchain-requirements), [build tools](\n17:    #build-tools-requirements), [external libraries](\n18:    #external-library-requirements) or the [boot JDK](#boot-jdk-requirements)),\n19:    most of the time it prints a suggestion on how to resolve the situation on\n20:    your platform. Follow the instructions, and try running `bash configure`\n21:    again.\n22:\n23: 3. [Run make](#running-make): \\\n24:    `make images`\n25:\n26: 4. Verify your newly built JDK: \\\n27:    `./build/*/images/jdk/bin/java -version`\n28:\n29: 5. [Run basic tests](#running-tests): \\\n30:    `make test-tier1`\n31:\n32:If any of these steps failed, or if you want to know more about build\n33:requirements or build functionality, please continue reading this document.\n34:\n35:## Introduction\n36:\n37:The JDK is a complex software project. Building it requires a certain amount of\n38:technical expertise, a fair number of dependencies on external software, and\n39:reasonably powerful hardware.\n40:\n41:If you just want to use the JDK and not build it yourself, this document is not\n42:for you. See for instance [OpenJDK installation](https://openjdk.org/install)\n43:for some methods of installing a prebuilt JDK.\n44:\n45:## Getting the Source Code\n46:\n47:Make sure you are getting the correct version. At the [OpenJDK Git\n48:site](https://git.openjdk.org/) you can see a list of all available\n49:repositories. Commonly used repositories are:\n50:\n51:* The [JDK Project](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk) (the main-line currently\n52:  in development): https://git.openjdk.org/jdk\n53:\n54:* The [JDK Updates Project](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk-updates/), which\n55:  has one repository per update release, e.g. https://git.openjdk.org/jdk17u\n56:  for JDK 17.\n57:\n58:If you want to build an older version, e.g. JDK 17, it is strongly recommended\n59:that you use the JDK Updates repository, e.g. the `jdk17u`, which contains\n60:incremental updates, instead of the JDK Project repository `jdk17`, which was\n61:frozen at JDK 17 GA.\n62:\n63:If you are new to Git, a good place to start is the book [Pro\n64:Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). The rest of this document assumes a\n65:working knowledge of Git.\n66:\n67:### Special Considerations\n68:\n69:For a smooth building experience, it is recommended that you follow these rules\n70:on where and how to check out the source code.\n71:\n72:* Do not check out the source code in a path which contains spaces. Chances are\n73:  the build will not work. This is most likely to be an issue on Windows\n74:  systems.\n75:\n76:* Do not check out the source code in a path which has a very long name or is\n77:  nested many levels deep. Chances are you will hit an OS limitation during the\n78:  build.\n79:\n80:* Put the source code on a local disk, not a network share. If possible, use an\n81:  SSD. The build process is very disk intensive, and having slow disk access\n82:  will significantly increase build times. If you need to use a network share\n83:  for the source code, see below for suggestions on how to keep the build\n84:  artifacts on a local disk.\n85:\n86:* UTF-8 support is needed to compile the JDK. On Unix systems, this typically\n87:  means that the `C.UTF-8` or `en_US.UTF-8` locale needs to be available. For\n88:  Windows users, please see the section on [Locale\n89:  Requirements](#locale-requirements) below.\n90:\n91:* On Windows, extra care must be taken to have a smooth building experience:\n92:\n93:  * Make sure that all relevant paths have short names. Short names are used by\n94:    the build system to create space-free alternative paths. Short name\n95:    creation is enabled per volume. The default setting can be checked with the\n96:    command: `fsutil 8dot3name query`. If short name creation was turned off\n97:    when a directory was created, it will not have a short name. Whether a\n98:    short name exists can be checked by running `dir /X` in the containing\n99:    directory (in cmd.exe). If a short path is present you should see something\n100:    like 'ASDF~1' being displayed in one of the columns of the ouput. If a\n(2247 more lines below)\n",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

They assume that you have installed Git (and Cygwin, MSYS2 or WSL if\n7:running on Windows), and want to clone the main-line JDK repository.\n8:\n9: 1. [Get the complete source code](#getting-the-source-code): \\\n10:    `git clone https://git.openjdk.org/jdk`\n11:\n12: 2. [Run configure](#running-configure): \\\n13:    `bash configure`\n14:\n15:    If `configure` fails due to missing dependencies (to either the\n16:    [toolchain](#native-compiler-toolchain-requirements), [build tools](\n17:    #build-tools-requirements), [external libraries](\n18:    #external-library-requirements) or the [boot JDK](#boot-jdk-requirements)),\n19:    most of the time it prints a suggestion on how to resolve the situation on\n20:    your platform. Follow the instructions, and try running `bash configure`\n21:    again.\n22:\n23: 3. [Run make](#running-make): \\\n24:    `make images`\n25:\n26: 4. Verify your newly built JDK: \\\n27:    `./build/*/images/jdk/bin/java -version`\n28:\n29: 5. [Run basic tests](#running-tests): \\\n30:    `make test-tier1`\n31:\n32:If any of these steps failed, or if you want to know more about build\n33:requirements or build functionality, please continue reading this document.\n34:\n35:## Introduction\n36:\n37:The JDK is a complex software project. Building it requires a certain amount of\n38:technical expertise, a fair number of dependencies on external software, and\n39:reasonably powerful hardware.\n40:\n41:If you just want to use the JDK and not build it yourself, this document is not\n42:for you. See for instance [OpenJDK installation](https://openjdk.org/install)\n43:for some methods of installing a prebuilt JDK.\n44:\n45:## Getting the Source Code\n46:\n47:Make sure you are getting the correct version. At the [OpenJDK Git\n48:site](https://git.openjdk.org/) you can see a list of all available\n49:repositories. Commonly used repositories are:\n50:\n51:* The [JDK Project](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk) (the main-line currently\n52:  in development): https://git.openjdk.org/jdk\n53:\n54:* The [JDK Updates Project](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk-updates/), which\n55:  has one repository per update release, e.g. https://git.openjdk.org/jdk17u\n56:  for JDK 17.\n57:\n58:If you want to build an older version, e.g. JDK 17, it is strongly recommended\n59:that you use the JDK Updates repository, e.g. the `jdk17u`, which contains\n60:incremental updates, instead of the JDK Project repository `jdk17`, which was\n61:frozen at JDK 17 GA.\n62:\n63:If you are new to Git, a good place to start is the book [Pro\n64:Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). The rest of this document assumes a\n65:working knowledge of Git.\n66:\n67:### Special Considerations\n68:\n69:For a smooth building experience, it is recommended that you follow these rules\n70:on where and how to check out the source code.\n71:\n72:* Do not check out the source code in a path which contains spaces. Chances are\n73:  the build will not work. This is most likely to be an issue on Windows\n74:  systems.\n75:\n76:* Do not check out the source code in a path which has a very long name or is\n77:  nested many levels deep. Chances are you will hit an OS limitation during the\n78:  build.\n79:\n80:* Put the source code on a local disk, not a network share. If possible, use an\n81:  SSD. The build process is very disk intensive, and having slow disk access\n82:  will significantly increase build times. If you need to use a network share\n83:  for the source code, see below for suggestions on how to keep the build\n84:  artifacts on a local disk.\n85:\n86:* UTF-8 support is needed to compile the JDK. On Unix systems, this typically\n87:  means that the `C.UTF-8` or `en_US.UTF-8` locale needs to be available. For\n88:  Windows users, please see the section on [Locale\n89:  Requirements](#locale-requirements) below.\n90:\n91:* On Windows, extra care must be taken to have a smooth building experience:\n92:\n93:  * Make sure that all relevant paths have short names. Short names are used by\n94:    the build system to create space-free alternative paths. Short name\n95:    creation is enabled per volume. The default setting can be checked with the\n96:    command: `fsutil 8dot3name query`. If short name creation was turned off\n97:    when a directory was created, it will not have a short name. Whether a\n98:    short name exists can be checked by running `dir /X` in the containing\n99:    directory (in cmd.exe). If a short path is present you should see something\n100:    like 'ASDF~1' being displayed in one of the columns of the ouput.

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

They assume that you have installed Git (and Cygwin, MSYS2 or WSL if\n7:running on Windows), and want to clone the main-line JDK repository.\n8:\n9: 1. [Get the complete source code](#getting-the-source-code): \\\n10:    `git clone https://git.openjdk.org/jdk`\n11:\n12: 2. [Run configure](#running-configure): \\\n13:    `bash configure`\n14:\n15:    If `configure` fails due to missing dependencies (to either the\n16:    [toolchain](#native-compiler-toolchain-requirements), [build tools](\n17:    #build-tools-requirements), [external libraries](\n18:    #external-library-requirements) or the [boot JDK](#boot-jdk-requirements)),\n19:    most of the time it prints a suggestion on how to resolve the situation on\n20:    your platform. Follow the instructions, and try running `bash configure`\n21:    again.\n22:\n23: 3. [Run make](#running-make): \\\n24:    `make images`\n25:\n26: 4. Verify your newly built JDK: \\\n27:    `./build/*/images/jdk/bin/java -version`\n28:\n29: 5. [Run basic tests](#running-tests): \\\n30:    `make test-tier1`\n31:\n32:If any of these steps failed, or if you want to know more about build\n33:requirements or build functionality, please continue reading this document.\n34:\n35:## Introduction\n36:\n37:The JDK is a complex software project. Building it requires a certain amount of\n38:technical expertise, a fair number of dependencies on external software, and\n39:reasonably powerful hardware.\n40:\n41:If you just want to use the JDK and not build it yourself, this document is not\n42:for you. See for instance [OpenJDK installation](https://openjdk.org/install)\n43:for some methods of installing a prebuilt JDK.\n44:\n45:## Getting the Source Code\n46:\n47:Make sure you are getting the correct version. At the [OpenJDK Git\n48:site](https://git.openjdk.org/) you can see a list of all available\n49:repositories. Commonly used repositories are:\n50:\n51:* The [JDK Project](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk) (the main-line currently\n52:  in development): https://git.openjdk.org/jdk\n53:\n54:* The [JDK Updates Project](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk-updates/), which\n55:  has one repository per update release, e.g. https://git.openjdk.org/jdk17u\n56:  for JDK 17.\n57:\n58:If you want to build an older version, e.g. JDK 17, it is strongly recommended\n59:that you use the JDK Updates repository, e.g. the `jdk17u`, which contains\n60:incremental updates, instead of the JDK Project repository `jdk17`, which was\n61:frozen at JDK 17 GA.\n62:\n63:If you are new to Git, a good place to start is the book [Pro\n64:Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). The rest of this document assumes a\n65:working knowledge of Git.\n66:\n67:### Special Considerations\n68:\n69:For a smooth building experience, it is recommended that you follow these rules\n70:on where and how to check out the source code.\n71:\n72:* Do not check out the source code in a path which contains spaces. Chances are\n73:  the build will not work. This is most likely to be an issue on Windows\n74:  systems.\n75:\n76:* Do not check out the source code in a path which has a very long name or is\n77:  nested many levels deep. Chances are you will hit an OS limitation during the\n78:  build.\n79:\n80:* Put the source code on a local disk, not a network share. If possible, use an\n81:  SSD. The build process is very disk intensive, and having slow disk access\n82:  will significantly increase build times. If you need to use a network share\n83:  for the source code, see below for suggestions on how to keep the build\n84:  artifacts on a local disk.\n85:\n86:* UTF-8 support is needed to compile the JDK. On Unix systems, this typically\n87:  means that the `C.UTF-8` or `en_US.UTF-8` locale needs to be available. For\n88:  Windows users, please see the section on [Locale\n89:  Requirements](#locale-requirements) below.\n90:\n91:* On Windows, extra care must be taken to have a smooth building experience:\n92:\n93:  * Make sure that all relevant paths have short names. Short names are used by\n94:    the build system to create space-free alternative paths. Short name\n95:    creation is enabled per volume. The default setting can be checked with the\n96:    command: `fsutil 8dot3name query`. If short name creation was turned off\n97:    when a directory was created, it will not have a short name. Whether a\n98:    short name exists can be checked by running `dir /X` in the containing\n99:    directory (in cmd.exe). If a short path is present you should see something\n100:    like 'ASDF~1' being displayed in one of the columns of the ouput.

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

They assume that you have installed Git (and Cygwin, MSYS2 or WSL if\n7:running on Windows), and want to clone the main-line JDK repository.\n8:\n9: 1. [Get the complete source code](#getting-the-source-code): \\\n10:    `git clone https://git.openjdk.org/jdk`\n11:\n12: 2. [Run configure](#running-configure): \\\n13:    `bash configure`\n14:\n15:    If `configure` fails due to missing dependencies (to either the\n16:    [toolchain](#native-compiler-toolchain-requirements), [build tools](\n17:    #build-tools-requirements), [external libraries](\n18:    #external-library-requirements) or the [boot JDK](#boot-jdk-requirements)),\n19:    most of the time it prints a suggestion on how to resolve the situation on\n20:    your platform. Follow the instructions, and try running `bash configure`\n21:    again.\n22:\n23: 3. [Run make](#running-make): \\\n24:    `make images`\n25:\n26: 4. Verify your newly built JDK: \\\n27:    `./build/*/images/jdk/bin/java -version`\n28:\n29: 5. [Run basic tests](#running-tests): \\\n30:    `make test-tier1`\n31:\n32:If any of these steps failed, or if you want to know more about build\n33:requirements or build functionality, please continue reading this document.\n34:\n35:## Introduction\n36:\n37:The JDK is a complex software project. Building it requires a certain amount of\n38:technical expertise, a fair number of dependencies on external software, and\n39:reasonably powerful hardware.\n40:\n41:If you just want to use the JDK and not build it yourself, this document is not\n42:for you. See for instance [OpenJDK installation](https://openjdk.org/install)\n43:for some methods of installing a prebuilt JDK.\n44:\n45:## Getting the Source Code\n46:\n47:Make sure you are getting the correct version. At the [OpenJDK Git\n48:site](https://git.openjdk.org/) you can see a list of all available\n49:repositories. Commonly used repositories are:\n50:\n51:* The [JDK Project](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk) (the main-line currently\n52:  in development): https://git.openjdk.org/jdk\n53:\n54:* The [JDK Updates Project](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk-updates/), which\n55:  has one repository per update release, e.g. https://git.openjdk.org/jdk17u\n56:  for JDK 17.\n57:\n58:If you want to build an older version, e.g. JDK 17, it is strongly recommended\n59:that you use the JDK Updates repository, e.g. the `jdk17u`, which contains\n60:incremental updates, instead of the JDK Project repository `jdk17`, which was\n61:frozen at JDK 17 GA.\n62:\n63:If you are new to Git, a good place to start is the book [Pro\n64:Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). The rest of this document assumes a\n65:working knowledge of Git.\n66:\n67:### Special Considerations\n68:\n69:For a smooth building experience, it is recommended that you follow these rules\n70:on where and how to check out the source code.\n71:\n72:* Do not check out the source code in a path which contains spaces. Chances are\n73:  the build will not work. This is most likely to be an issue on Windows\n74:  systems.\n75:\n76:* Do not check out the source code in a path which has a very long name or is\n77:  nested many levels deep. Chances are you will hit an OS limitation during the\n78:  build.\n79:\n80:* Put the source code on a local disk, not a network share. If possible, use an\n81:  SSD. The build process is very disk intensive, and having slow disk access\n82:  will significantly increase build times. If you need to use a network share\n83:  for the source code, see below for suggestions on how to keep the build\n84:  artifacts on a local disk.\n85:\n86:* UTF-8 support is needed to compile the JDK. On Unix systems, this typically\n87:  means that the `C.UTF-8` or `en_US.UTF-8` locale needs to be available. For\n88:  Windows users, please see the section on [Locale\n89:  Requirements](#locale-requirements) below.\n90:\n91:* On Windows, extra care must be taken to have a smooth building experience:\n92:\n93:  * Make sure that all relevant paths have short names. Short names are used by\n94:    the build system to create space-free alternative paths. Short name\n95:    creation is enabled per volume. The default setting can be checked with the\n96:    command: `fsutil 8dot3name query`. If short name creation was turned off\n97:    when a directory was created, it will not have a short name. Whether a\n98:    short name exists can be checked by running `dir /X` in the containing\n99:    directory (in cmd.exe). If a short path is present you should see something\n100:    like 'ASDF~1' being displayed in one of the columns of the ouput.

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

They assume that you have installed Git (and Cygwin, MSYS2 or WSL if\n7:running on Windows), and want to clone the main-line JDK repository.\n8:\n9: 1. [Get the complete source code](#getting-the-source-code): \\\n10:    `git clone https://git.openjdk.org/jdk`\n11:\n12: 2. [Run configure](#running-configure): \\\n13:    `bash configure`\n14:\n15:    If `configure` fails due to missing dependencies (to either the\n16:    [toolchain](#native-compiler-toolchain-requirements), [build tools](\n17:    #build-tools-requirements), [external libraries](\n18:    #external-library-requirements) or the [boot JDK](#boot-jdk-requirements)),\n19:    most of the time it prints a suggestion on how to resolve the situation on\n20:    your platform. Follow the instructions, and try running `bash configure`\n21:    again.\n22:\n23: 3. [Run make](#running-make): \\\n24:    `make images`\n25:\n26: 4. Verify your newly built JDK: \\\n27:    `./build/*/images/jdk/bin/java -version`\n28:\n29: 5. [Run basic tests](#running-tests): \\\n30:    `make test-tier1`\n31:\n32:If any of these steps failed, or if you want to know more about build\n33:requirements or build functionality, please continue reading this document.\n34:\n35:## Introduction\n36:\n37:The JDK is a complex software project. Building it requires a certain amount of\n38:technical expertise, a fair number of dependencies on external software, and\n39:reasonably powerful hardware.\n40:\n41:If you just want to use the JDK and not build it yourself, this document is not\n42:for you. See for instance [OpenJDK installation](https://openjdk.org/install)\n43:for some methods of installing a prebuilt JDK.\n44:\n45:## Getting the Source Code\n46:\n47:Make sure you are getting the correct version. At the [OpenJDK Git\n48:site](https://git.openjdk.org/) you can see a list of all available\n49:repositories. Commonly used repositories are:\n50:\n51:* The [JDK Project](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk) (the main-line currently\n52:  in development): https://git.openjdk.org/jdk\n53:\n54:* The [JDK Updates Project](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk-updates/), which\n55:  has one repository per update release, e.g. https://git.openjdk.org/jdk17u\n56:  for JDK 17.\n57:\n58:If you want to build an older version, e.g. JDK 17, it is strongly recommended\n59:that you use the JDK Updates repository, e.g. the `jdk17u`, which contains\n60:incremental updates, instead of the JDK Project repository `jdk17`, which was\n61:frozen at JDK 17 GA.\n62:\n63:If you are new to Git, a good place to start is the book [Pro\n64:Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). The rest of this document assumes a\n65:working knowledge of Git.\n66:\n67:### Special Considerations\n68:\n69:For a smooth building experience, it is recommended that you follow these rules\n70:on where and how to check out the source code.\n71:\n72:* Do not check out the source code in a path which contains spaces. Chances are\n73:  the build will not work. This is most likely to be an issue on Windows\n74:  systems.\n75:\n76:* Do not check out the source code in a path which has a very long name or is\n77:  nested many levels deep. Chances are you will hit an OS limitation during the\n78:  build.\n79:\n80:* Put the source code on a local disk, not a network share. If possible, use an\n81:  SSD. The build process is very disk intensive, and having slow disk access\n82:  will significantly increase build times. If you need to use a network share\n83:  for the source code, see below for suggestions on how to keep the build\n84:  artifacts on a local disk.\n85:\n86:* UTF-8 support is needed to compile the JDK. On Unix systems, this typically\n87:  means that the `C.UTF-8` or `en_US.UTF-8` locale needs to be available. For\n88:  Windows users, please see the section on [Locale\n89:  Requirements](#locale-requirements) below.\n90:\n91:* On Windows, extra care must be taken to have a smooth building experience:\n92:\n93:  * Make sure that all relevant paths have short names. Short names are used by\n94:    the build system to create space-free alternative paths. Short name\n95:    creation is enabled per volume. The default setting can be checked with the\n96:    command: `fsutil 8dot3name query`. If short name creation was turned off\n97:    when a directory was created, it will not have a short name. Whether a\n98:    short name exists can be checked by running `dir /X` in the containing\n99:    directory (in cmd.exe). If a short path is present you should see something\n100:    like 'ASDF~1' being displayed in one of the columns of the ouput.

The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

They assume that you have installed Git (and Cygwin, MSYS2 or WSL if\n7:running on Windows), and want to clone the main-line JDK repository.\n8:\n9: 1. [Get the complete source code](#getting-the-source-code): \\\n10:    `git clone https://git.openjdk.org/jdk`\n11:\n12: 2. [Run configure](#running-configure): \\\n13:    `bash configure`\n14:\n15:    If `configure` fails due to missing dependencies (to either the\n16:    [toolchain](#native-compiler-toolchain-requirements), [build tools](\n17:    #build-tools-requirements), [external libraries](\n18:    #external-library-requirements) or the [boot JDK](#boot-jdk-requirements)),\n19:    most of the time it prints a suggestion on how to resolve the situation on\n20:    your platform. Follow the instructions, and try running `bash configure`\n21:    again.\n22:\n23: 3. [Run make](#running-make): \\\n24:    `make images`\n25:\n26: 4. Verify your newly built JDK: \\\n27:    `./build/*/images/jdk/bin/java -version`\n28:\n29: 5. [Run basic tests](#running-tests): \\\n30:    `make test-tier1`\n31:\n32:If any of these steps failed, or if you want to know more about build\n33:requirements or build functionality, please continue reading this document.\n34:\n35:## Introduction\n36:\n37:The JDK is a complex software project. Building it requires a certain amount of\n38:technical expertise, a fair number of dependencies on external software, and\n39:reasonably powerful hardware.\n40:\n41:If you just want to use the JDK and not build it yourself, this document is not\n42:for you. See for instance [OpenJDK installation](https://openjdk.org/install)\n43:for some methods of installing a prebuilt JDK.\n44:\n45:## Getting the Source Code\n46:\n47:Make sure you are getting the correct version. At the [OpenJDK Git\n48:site](https://git.openjdk.org/) you can see a list of all available\n49:repositories. Commonly used repositories are:\n50:\n51:* The [JDK Project](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk) (the main-line currently\n52:  in development): https://git.openjdk.org/jdk\n53:\n54:* The [JDK Updates Project](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk-updates/), which\n55:  has one repository per update release, e.g. https://git.openjdk.org/jdk17u\n56:  for JDK 17.\n57:\n58:If you want to build an older version, e.g. JDK 17, it is strongly recommended\n59:that you use the JDK Updates repository, e.g. the `jdk17u`, which contains\n60:incremental updates, instead of the JDK Project repository `jdk17`, which was\n61:frozen at JDK 17 GA.\n62:\n63:If you are new to Git, a good place to start is the book [Pro\n64:Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). The rest of this document assumes a\n65:working knowledge of Git.\n66:\n67:### Special Considerations\n68:\n69:For a smooth building experience, it is recommended that you follow these rules\n70:on where and how to check out the source code.\n71:\n72:* Do not check out the source code in a path which contains spaces. Chances are\n73:  the build will not work. This is most likely to be an issue on Windows\n74:  systems.\n75:\n76:* Do not check out the source code in a path which has a very long name or is\n77:  nested many levels deep. Chances are you will hit an OS limitation during the\n78:  build.\n79:\n80:* Put the source code on a local disk, not a network share. If possible, use an\n81:  SSD. The build process is very disk intensive, and having slow disk access\n82:  will significantly increase build times. If you need to use a network share\n83:  for the source code, see below for suggestions on how to keep the build\n84:  artifacts on a local disk.\n85:\n86:* UTF-8 support is needed to compile the JDK. On Unix systems, this typically\n87:  means that the `C.UTF-8` or `en_US.UTF-8` locale needs to be available. For\n88:  Windows users, please see the section on [Locale\n89:  Requirements](#locale-requirements) below.\n90:\n91:* On Windows, extra care must be taken to have a smooth building experience:\n92:\n93:  * Make sure that all relevant paths have short names. Short names are used by\n94:    the build system to create space-free alternative paths. Short name\n95:    creation is enabled per volume. The default setting can be checked with the\n96:    command: `fsutil 8dot3name query`. If short name creation was turned off\n97:    when a directory was created, it will not have a short name. Whether a\n98:    short name exists can be checked by running `dir /X` in the containing\n99:    directory (in cmd.exe). If a short path is present you should see something\n100:    like 'ASDF~1' being displayed in one of the columns of the ouput.

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4.

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- autoconf\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - alpine-sdk\n  - alsa-lib-dev\n  - autoconf\n  - bash\n  - cups-dev\n  - cups-libs\n  - fontconfig-dev\n  - freetype-dev\n  - grep\n  - libx11-dev\n  - libxext-dev\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxrender-dev\n  - libxt-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - linux-headers\n  - wget\n  - zip\n  - gcc\n  - g++\n  - libxrandr-dev\n  - libxtst-dev\n  - libcups2-dev\n  - libasound2-dev\n  - debootstrap\n  - qemu-user-static\n  - make\n  - xcode-select\n  likely_required:\n  - libssl-dev\ntest_framework:\n- JTReg\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Missing libexecinfo dependency required for Alpine Linux builds caused installation failures\n    - Solution: The BUILD.md specified libexecinfo as a dependency for Alpine, but it was unavailable in default repositories. The root cause was repository version mismatch (Alpine 3.22 vs required 3.12 packages). The solution was adding Alpine 3.12 repositories and installing libexecinfo-dev/libexecinfo-static.\n    - Action: echo \"https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories && apk update && apk add libexecinfo-dev libexecinfo-static\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The initial make command failed due to an outdated CMake version\n    - Solution: The CMake version installed (3.10.2) was below the required minimum (3.15) for building the project. The root cause was an outdated package in the Ubuntu repositories. The solution involved building and installing a newer CMake version from source after resolving dependencies.\n    - Action: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.3/cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && tar -zxvf cmake-3.28.3.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.28.3 && ./bootstrap && make && make install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The CMake configuration step failed to locate the GTest framework required for building tests\n    - Solution: GTest was not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing CMake from finding necessary components (GTEST_LIBRARY, GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY) for test compilation. The root cause was missing test framework dependencies. The solution was to install the libgtest-dev package via apt.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

They assume that you have installed Git (and Cygwin, MSYS2 or WSL if\n7:running on Windows), and want to clone the main-line JDK repository.\n8:\n9: 1. [Get the complete source code](#getting-the-source-code): \\\n10:    `git clone https://git.openjdk.org/jdk`\n11:\n12: 2. [Run configure](#running-configure): \\\n13:    `bash configure`\n14:\n15:    If `configure` fails due to missing dependencies (to either the\n16:    [toolchain](#native-compiler-toolchain-requirements), [build tools](\n17:    #build-tools-requirements), [external libraries](\n18:    #external-library-requirements) or the [boot JDK](#boot-jdk-requirements)),\n19:    most of the time it prints a suggestion on how to resolve the situation on\n20:    your platform. Follow the instructions, and try running `bash configure`\n21:    again.\n22:\n23: 3. [Run make](#running-make): \\\n24:    `make images`\n25:\n26: 4. Verify your newly built JDK: \\\n27:    `./build/*/images/jdk/bin/java -version`\n28:\n29: 5. [Run basic tests](#running-tests): \\\n30:    `make test-tier1`\n31:\n32:If any of these steps failed, or if you want to know more about build\n33:requirements or build functionality, please continue reading this document.\n34:\n35:## Introduction\n36:\n37:The JDK is a complex software project. Building it requires a certain amount of\n38:technical expertise, a fair number of dependencies on external software, and\n39:reasonably powerful hardware.\n40:\n41:If you just want to use the JDK and not build it yourself, this document is not\n42:for you. See for instance [OpenJDK installation](https://openjdk.org/install)\n43:for some methods of installing a prebuilt JDK.\n44:\n45:## Getting the Source Code\n46:\n47:Make sure you are getting the correct version. At the [OpenJDK Git\n48:site](https://git.openjdk.org/) you can see a list of all available\n49:repositories. Commonly used repositories are:\n50:\n51:* The [JDK Project](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk) (the main-line currently\n52:  in development): https://git.openjdk.org/jdk\n53:\n54:* The [JDK Updates Project](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk-updates/), which\n55:  has one repository per update release, e.g. https://git.openjdk.org/jdk17u\n56:  for JDK 17.\n57:\n58:If you want to build an older version, e.g. JDK 17, it is strongly recommended\n59:that you use the JDK Updates repository, e.g. the `jdk17u`, which contains\n60:incremental updates, instead of the JDK Project repository `jdk17`, which was\n61:frozen at JDK 17 GA.\n62:\n63:If you are new to Git, a good place to start is the book [Pro\n64:Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). The rest of this document assumes a\n65:working knowledge of Git.\n66:\n67:### Special Considerations\n68:\n69:For a smooth building experience, it is recommended that you follow these rules\n70:on where and how to check out the source code.\n71:\n72:* Do not check out the source code in a path which contains spaces. Chances are\n73:  the build will not work. This is most likely to be an issue on Windows\n74:  systems.\n75:\n76:* Do not check out the source code in a path which has a very long name or is\n77:  nested many levels deep. Chances are you will hit an OS limitation during the\n78:  build.\n79:\n80:* Put the source code on a local disk, not a network share. If possible, use an\n81:  SSD. The build process is very disk intensive, and having slow disk access\n82:  will significantly increase build times. If you need to use a network share\n83:  for the source code, see below for suggestions on how to keep the build\n84:  artifacts on a local disk.\n85:\n86:* UTF-8 support is needed to compile the JDK. On Unix systems, this typically\n87:  means that the `C.UTF-8` or `en_US.UTF-8` locale needs to be available. For\n88:  Windows users, please see the section on [Locale\n89:  Requirements](#locale-requirements) below.\n90:\n91:* On Windows, extra care must be taken to have a smooth building experience:\n92:\n93:  * Make sure that all relevant paths have short names. Short names are used by\n94:    the build system to create space-free alternative paths. Short name\n95:    creation is enabled per volume. The default setting can be checked with the\n96:    command: `fsutil 8dot3name query`. If short name creation was turned off\n97:    when a directory was created, it will not have a short name. Whether a\n98:    short name exists can be checked by running `dir /X` in the containing\n99:    directory (in cmd.exe). If a short path is present you should see something\n100:    like 'ASDF~1' being displayed in one of the columns of the ouput.

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\",\"instance_template\":\"We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\\n\\n{{repo_related_info}}\\n\\n{{cross_repo_knowledge}}\\n\\nTASK TIPS:\\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.\",\"next_step_template\":\"{{observation}}\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"next_step_no_output_template\":\"Your command ran successfully and did not produce any output.\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"strategy_template\":null,\"demonstration_template\":null,\"success_reflection_template\":\"You are an expert code assistant who just successfully repaired a software project in an automated programming session.
