"FAILED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent attempted to build and run tests but encountered persistent network issues preventing the download of external dependencies (xxHash, lz4, cJSON, openssl). While the main project was successfully built, no test suite could be executed to completion due to these dependency failures. The BUILD_TEST=OFF configuration also prevented test binaries from being built.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main executable (taos) was successfully built and ran without errors, showing version information. This indicates the core functionality is operational. However, without test execution, we cannot fully verify all functional modules.\n\nThe environment configuration partially succeeded (core functionality works) but ultimately failed the success criteria because:\n- No test suite completed execution due to dependency issues\n- While core executables work, we lack comprehensive verification of all functional modules through test execution\n- The agent exceeded reasonable effort limits trying to resolve network-related dependency issues"
