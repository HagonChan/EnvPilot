"PASSED\n\nDetailed reasoning:\n1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**:\n   - The unit tests (`npm run test:unit`) completed successfully with 66 out of 69 test suites passing and 786 out of 798 tests passing. The skipped tests/suites were due to environment-specific conditions.\n   - The artifact tests (`npm run test:artifact`) completed successfully with all 3 test suites passing.\n   - The Cypress end-to-end tests started and executed, though some failed. The test framework generated a complete report structure, meeting the criteria of \"test suite completion\" despite individual failures.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**:\n   - The build process (`npm run build`) completed successfully, generating all required artifacts in the `dist` directory.\n   - The server started successfully on port 3002 and served the built artifacts, demonstrating core functionality.\n   - The project's main modules were successfully imported and used during the test execution.\n\n3. **Success Criteria Met**:\n   - Both conditions are satisfied: at least one complete test suite executed successfully (unit tests and artifact tests), and core functionality was verified through successful builds and server operation.\n   - The Cypress test failures are considered non-critical as they don't prevent the framework from operating or the core functionality from working."
