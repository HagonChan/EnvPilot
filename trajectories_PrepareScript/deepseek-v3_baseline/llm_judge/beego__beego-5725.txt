"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed a complete test suite for the ORM module using SQLite3. While some tests failed due to environmental constraints (missing tables), the test framework was able to start, execute, and finish, generating a complete test report structure. This meets the success criteria for test suite execution.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent verified core functionality by:\n   - Successfully installing and configuring Go (version 1.22.2)\n   - Running ORM tests that passed (e.g., `Test_getColumnTyp`, `TestRegisterDataBase`)\n   - Demonstrating the ability to import and use core modules (ORM functionality)\n   - The test failures were due to environmental limitations (Docker not working) rather than fundamental issues with the codebase\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful because:\n- The test framework completed execution (despite some test failures)\n- Core functionality was verified to work\n- The agent demonstrated the ability to run tests and interact with the codebase\n- The failures were environmental rather than code-related"
