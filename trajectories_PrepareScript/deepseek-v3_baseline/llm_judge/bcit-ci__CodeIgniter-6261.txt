"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The PHPUnit test suite executed successfully, running 396 tests with 11 warnings and 24 skipped tests. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, including a code coverage summary. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The environment was properly configured with PHP 8.1 and all required extensions. Composer dependencies were installed, and the test suite ran without critical errors (only warnings about deprecated assertions). The core functionality of the CodeIgniter framework was verified through the test execution, meeting Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful as both conditions are satisfied: the test suite completed execution, and core functionality was verified. The warnings and skipped tests do not affect the overall success as they are non-critical issues."
