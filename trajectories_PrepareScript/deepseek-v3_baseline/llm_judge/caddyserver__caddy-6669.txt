"PASSED\nDetailed Reasoning:\n\n1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):\n- Multiple test suites executed successfully, as evidenced by the \"ok\" status for most test packages\n- The testing framework generated complete test reports with PASS/FAIL statuses for each test case\n- While there were some test errors and warnings, the test suites completed their execution\n- The final test run showed all tests passing with no failures\n\n2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):\n- The project built successfully after resolving the Go debug directive issue\n- Core modules were imported and used normally during test execution\n- Basic functionality was demonstrated through the successful execution of numerous test cases\n- The main application (Caddy) was successfully compiled and would be operational\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria:\n1. At least one complete test suite executed successfully (multiple actually passed)\n2. Core functionality was verified through test execution and successful build\n\nNote: While there were some initial test failures and warnings, these were resolved and didn't prevent the test suites from completing or the core functionality from working. The final test run confirmed all tests passed."
