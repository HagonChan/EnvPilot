"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite successfully started, executed, and completed. Out of 322 test suites, 321 passed and only 1 failed. Similarly, out of 9733 tests, 9706 passed with only 2 failures. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute successfully, even with some individual test failures.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The environment was properly configured with Node.js v18.20.6 (close enough to required v18.20.1) and Yarn 1.22.22. All dependencies were successfully installed using `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`, and the test command `yarn test` executed the full test suite, demonstrating that core functionality is working.\n\nThe few test failures don't indicate fundamental environment configuration problems but rather appear to be specific test case issues, which is acceptable per the success criteria. The testing framework generated a complete test report structure and the majority of tests passed, confirming the environment is correctly configured."
