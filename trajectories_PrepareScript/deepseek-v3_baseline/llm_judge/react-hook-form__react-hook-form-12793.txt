"PASSED\nDetailed Reasoning:\n1. Test Suite Execution:\n   - The test suite completed successfully with all 98 test suites passing and 1787 tests executed (as shown in the final test output).\n   - The testing framework (Jest) generated a complete test report structure including test counts, pass/fail status, and snapshots.\n   - The output shows proper test execution with detailed progress reporting.\n\n2. Core Functionality Verification:\n   - The project's main modules were successfully installed via pnpm (as evidenced by the dependency installation output).\n   - The test execution demonstrates that core functionality is working since all tests passed, including tests for key features like useForm, useFieldArray, and other core React Hook Form functionality.\n   - The successful test run implies that the core modules can be imported and used normally, as the tests wouldn't pass otherwise.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria:\n- At least one complete test suite executed successfully (in fact, all test suites passed)\n- Core functionality was verified through the successful execution of all tests\n- The agent successfully navigated through all necessary setup steps including:\n  * Installing required tools (Node.js, pnpm)\n  * Configuring the correct Node.js version\n  * Installing project dependencies\n  * Running the full test suite"
