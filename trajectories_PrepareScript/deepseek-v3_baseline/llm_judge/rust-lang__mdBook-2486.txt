"PASSED\nDetailed Reasoning:\n1. Test Suite Execution: The agent successfully executed the test suite using `cargo test --locked`. The output shows multiple test suites running and completing successfully, including unit tests and doc-tests. The test framework generated a complete report structure with clear pass/fail results (all tests passed).\n\n2. Core Functionality Verification: The project built successfully and all main functional modules were imported and used normally. The test output demonstrates core functionality working as expected, with tests for various components (like the remove-emphasis example and nop-preprocessor) executing correctly. The doc-tests also passed, verifying API documentation examples work as intended.\n\nBoth success criteria are fully met - the test suite completed execution and core functionality was verified through successful test runs. The agent overcame initial SSL/network issues by using alternative installation methods, demonstrating proper environment configuration."
