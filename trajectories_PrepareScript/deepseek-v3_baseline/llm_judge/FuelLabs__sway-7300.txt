"FAILED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent was unable to successfully execute any test suite. The build process failed due to incompatible Rust version (installed 1.75.0 vs required 1.86.0) and network issues preventing dependency downloads. No test suite was able to start or complete.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent couldn't verify core functionality as the project failed to build. Key modules couldn't be imported or used due to the build failures. The fundamental issue was the inability to resolve dependency requirements (edition2024 feature) with the available Rust version.\n\nThe environment configuration was unsuccessful because:\n- The required Rust toolchain couldn't be properly installed\n- Dependency resolution failed due to version incompatibilities\n- Network restrictions prevented downloading necessary components\n- No test suite could be executed\n- Core functionality couldn't be verified due to build failures\n\nThe agent made multiple attempts to resolve the issues but was ultimately constrained by the environment limitations. The task would require either network access to install the correct Rust version or modification of dependency requirements to proceed."
