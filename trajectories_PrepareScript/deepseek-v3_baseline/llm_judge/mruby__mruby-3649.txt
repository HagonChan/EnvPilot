"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed with `./minirake test`, completing all 959 tests with 0 failures (OK: 959, KO: 0, Crash: 0). This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite finish successfully.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The build process completed successfully, generating binaries (`mruby`, `mirb`, etc.) and libraries. The test output confirms core functionality is operational, as evidenced by the successful execution of the test suite and the generation of test reports.\n\nThe environment configuration was successful despite initial compatibility issues with Ruby 3.0.2, which were resolved by modifying the `Rakefile` to remove deprecated `FileUtils` options. The agent achieved both critical success criteria without violating any task constraints."
