"FAILED\n1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): Not met. The agent was unable to execute any test suite due to missing dependencies (pnpm and correct Node.js version). No test suite could start or complete.\n2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): Not met. The agent couldn't install necessary dependencies or build the project, so core functionality couldn't be verified. No modules could be imported or tested.\n\nDetailed reasoning:\n- The environment lacked fundamental tools (curl, wget, sudo) needed to install required dependencies\n- Node.js installation was outdated (v12.22.9 vs required v23.11.0)\n- pnpm couldn't be installed due to missing npm and download tools\n- Without pnpm, the project couldn't be built or tested as per the package.json scripts\n- The agent exhausted all possible installation methods within the constrained environment\n- No test suite executed and no core functionality could be verified\n\nThe environment configuration failed because basic requirements couldn't be met due to system constraints, preventing both test execution and core functionality verification."
