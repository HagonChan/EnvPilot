"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The unit tests (`gotest`) executed successfully across multiple packages (assets, cmd, client, server, pkg). While the end-to-end tests (`e2e`) had failures, the test framework completed execution and generated detailed reports for both passing and failing tests. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute successfully.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project was successfully built (`make build` produced frps/frpc binaries), and core modules were importable as evidenced by the unit test execution. Basic functionality was demonstrated through the successful execution of unit tests covering configuration loading, utilities, and other core components.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful because:\n- The testing framework executed to completion (Condition 1)\n- Core functionality was verified through unit tests and successful builds (Condition 2)\n- While some end-to-end tests failed, this doesn't invalidate the basic operational requirements as per the success criteria"
