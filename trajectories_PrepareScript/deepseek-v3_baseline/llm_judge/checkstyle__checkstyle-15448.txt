"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The Maven build successfully executed the test suite, including 5104 tests. Although there was 1 failure and 413 skipped tests, the test suite completed execution and generated detailed reports in the `target/surefire-reports` directory. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish, even with individual test failures.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality of the Checkstyle project was verified through the successful execution of the majority of tests. The project was built and installed using Maven, and the main functional modules were imported and used normally. The single test failure (`MainTest.testExistingTargetFileButWithoutReadAccess`) does not indicate a fundamental break in core functionality but rather a specific edge case discrepancy.\n\nThe environment configuration (JDK 11, Groovy, Maven) was correctly set up, and the project's build and test processes ran as expected, fulfilling both success criteria."
