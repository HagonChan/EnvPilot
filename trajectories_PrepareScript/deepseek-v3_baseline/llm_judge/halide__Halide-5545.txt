"FAILED\nDetailed Reasoning:\n\n1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):**\n   - The agent attempted to run the test suite but encountered multiple failures during the build process.\n   - The critical issue was the inability to locate the `llvm/Support/TargetRegistry.h` header file, which prevented the build from completing.\n   - No test suite was able to start or complete successfully due to these build failures.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):**\n   - The agent was unable to verify core functionality because the project failed to build.\n   - Core modules could not be imported or used normally due to the build failures.\n   - Basic API calls and example code execution were not possible since the project didn't reach a functional state.\n\n3. **Failure Conditions Met:**\n   - The testing framework could not start or execute normally due to missing dependencies and build errors.\n   - Core modules were fundamentally broken because the project couldn't be built.\n   - The agent exceeded reasonable effort in trying to resolve the LLVM version compatibility issues without success.\n\n4. **Root Cause:**\n   - The primary issue was version incompatibility between the Halide project's requirements and available LLVM packages.\n   - The project appears to require a specific LLVM version (likely 12 or earlier) that isn't readily available in standard Ubuntu repositories.\n   - The CI/CD configuration suggests using a custom-built LLVM package, but access to this resource wasn't available.\n\n5. **Constraints:**\n   - The task's prohibition on modifying repository files prevented workarounds like updating include paths.\n   - Without access to the Halide buildbot's prebuilt packages, resolving the dependency issue wasn't feasible.\n\nThe environment configuration did not meet either success criterion due to unresolved dependency issues preventing both test execution and core functionality verification."
