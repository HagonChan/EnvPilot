"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite ran successfully with `make test`, executing 179 tests. While 2 tests (`cd.fish` and `path.fish`) failed, the majority (177 tests) passed, and the test framework completed its execution with a full report structure. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project was successfully built using `cmake` and `make`, indicating that core modules can be compiled and imported. The ability to run the majority of tests demonstrates that basic API calls and core features are functional. The test failures appear to be specific edge cases rather than fundamental functionality issues.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful because:\n- The test suite completed execution (despite some individual test failures)\n- Core functionality was verified through successful build and test execution\n- The agent followed the repository's documented build and test procedures without modifying test cases"
