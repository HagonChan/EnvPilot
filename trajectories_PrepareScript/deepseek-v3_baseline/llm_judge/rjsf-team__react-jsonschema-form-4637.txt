The output shows: \"NX   Successfully ran target test for 13 projects (34s)\"\n- While there were some flaky tasks warnings, these are non-critical and don't prevent the test suite from completing\n- The testing framework (Jest via Nx) generated complete test reports\n\n### Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification\n- The build process completed successfully for all 14 projects, indicating core modules were compiled correctly\n- The successful test execution demonstrates that core functionality is working as expected\n- The environment was properly configured with Node.js 22.x and all dependencies installed\n\n### Additional Notes\n- The agent followed the correct process by:\n  1. Installing required Node.js version\n  2. Installing dependencies via `npm ci`\n  3. Building the project\n  4. Running tests\n- The initial test failures were resolved by building the project first, showing proper troubleshooting\n- The flaky test warnings don't affect the success criteria as they represent potential intermittent issues rather than fundamental problems"
