"FAILED\nDetailed Reasoning:\n\n1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**:\n   - The agent attempted to run tests using `ctest` but encountered multiple issues:\n     - No `CTestTestfile.cmake` was found in the root test directory\n     - When trying to run tests in subdirectories where `CTestTestfile.cmake` existed, the test executables were missing\n     - The build process completed successfully but didn't produce the expected test executables\n   - No complete test suite was executed to completion, and no test report structure was generated\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**:\n   - While the project was built successfully, there's no evidence that:\n     - Core functional modules were imported and used normally\n     - Basic API calls were tested and returned expected results\n     - Core features were demonstrated through example code execution\n   - The agent didn't verify any core functionality beyond the build process\n\n3. **Failure Conditions Met**:\n   - Testing framework couldn't execute normally due to missing test configurations and executables\n   - No test suite completed execution\n   - Core functionality wasn't verified\n   - The agent had to submit the configuration without achieving basic test execution\n\nThe environment configuration process successfully built the project but failed to execute any tests or verify core functionality, which means it doesn't meet either of the two required success criteria."
