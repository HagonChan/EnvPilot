"PASSED\nDetailed reasoning:\n1. Test Suite Execution: The test suite completed successfully with the majority of tests passing. While there were some failures (e.g., in `sympy/codegen/tests/test_ast.py`), the test framework generated a complete test report structure and executed the full suite. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n\n2. Core Functionality Verification: The core functionality of SymPy was verified through:\n   - Successful installation from source using `setup.py`\n   - Execution of multiple test cases across various modules\n   - Demonstration of core functionality through example code execution (as seen in the test output)\n   - Ability to import and use main functional modules after fixing the outdated imports\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful because:\n- The test suite completed execution (Condition 1)\n- Core modules can be imported and basic functionality works (Condition 2)\n- The agent addressed critical errors (import failures) while some non-critical test failures remain\n\nNote that while not all tests passed, the success criteria only requires that the test suite completes and core functionality works, which has been achieved. The remaining test failures would need to be addressed in future work but don't prevent the current environment configuration from being considered successful."
