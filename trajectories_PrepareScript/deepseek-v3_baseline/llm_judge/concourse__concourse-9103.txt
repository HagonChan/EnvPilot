"FAILED\nDetailed Reasoning:\n1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):** The agent was unable to execute any test suite successfully. While the project built successfully after modifying the `go.mod` file to use Go 1.20, the test execution failed due to missing packages (`crypto/ecdh`, `slices`, etc.) that were introduced in Go 1.21+. The project's original requirement of Go 1.24 could not be met as this version is not yet released.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):** The agent successfully built the project after downgrading the Go version requirement in `go.mod`, which suggests basic compilation functionality was working. However, without successful test execution, we cannot verify that core functionality works as expected. The build success alone doesn't meet the second condition since we can't confirm API functionality or feature operation.\n\n3. **Failure Conditions Met:** The environment configuration ultimately failed because:\n   - No test suite could complete execution due to missing Go packages\n   - The required Go version (1.24) was unavailable\n   - The agent reached the practical limits of environment configuration without violating task constraints\n\nThe agent made reasonable attempts to configure the environment but was fundamentally limited by the project's requirements for an unreleased Go version. Neither of the two success criteria were fully met."
