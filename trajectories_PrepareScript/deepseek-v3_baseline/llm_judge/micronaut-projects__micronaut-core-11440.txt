"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The Gradle build and test command (`./gradlew check`) was successfully executed, and multiple test suites completed with test reports generated. Although some tests failed, the test framework produced complete reports, meeting the success criteria for test suite execution.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The build process completed, and core modules were compiled and tested. The presence of test reports indicates that the core functionality was exercised, even though some tests failed. The environment was correctly configured to run the tests as per the project's CI workflow.\n\nThe failures observed are likely due to project-specific issues (e.g., HTTP/2/SSL configurations) rather than environment misconfiguration, as evidenced by successful HTTP/2 support verification via `curl`. The agent successfully met both success criteria despite the test failures."
