"FAILED\nDetailed Reasoning:\n\n1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**:\n   - The agent attempted to set up the environment and run tests but encountered multiple dependency issues (FFmpeg version mismatch, libplacebo version mismatch, glad submodule issues).\n   - No test suite was successfully executed to completion. The build process failed before reaching the test execution phase.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**:\n   - The project could not be built due to unresolved dependencies, so core functionality could not be verified.\n   - Main functional modules were not imported or tested due to the build failures.\n\n3. **Failure Conditions Met**:\n   - The testing framework could not start or execute normally due to dependency issues.\n   - Core modules could not be imported or built.\n   - The agent exceeded reasonable effort limits without achieving basic functionality.\n\n4. **Key Issues**:\n   - FFmpeg version requirements were not met despite multiple installation attempts.\n   - libplacebo version requirements were not satisfied.\n   - glad submodule initialization failed repeatedly.\n   - The session ended with a Python environment error before completing the setup.\n\nThe environment configuration was unsuccessful as neither of the two success criteria were met. The process failed at the dependency resolution and build stages, preventing any test execution or functionality verification."
