"PASSED\n\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully with `mage test`, completing multiple test packages. While there was one failure in `TestVimeoShortcode` (likely due to external API issues), the vast majority of tests passed and the test framework generated a complete report structure. This meets the success criteria as the test suite completed execution despite some individual test failures.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality of the Hugo project was verified through:\n   - Successful installation of all Go dependencies via `go mod download`\n   - Proper setup of the build system with `mage`\n   - Execution of the main test suite covering core components\n   - The fact that most test packages (like `hugolib`, `helpers`, `config`) passed indicates the core modules are functional\n\nThe single test failure appears to be related to an external service (Vimeo API) rather than core functionality, which doesn't invalidate the environment configuration success. The agent successfully completed all required steps without exceeding call limits."
