"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed the test suite using `yarn test`, which ran 57 test suites with 488 tests, all of which passed. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute successfully and generate a complete test report structure.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent verified core functionality by installing dependencies and running the tests, which confirmed that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally. The successful execution of all tests demonstrates that the core features are working as expected.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful as both conditions are met: the test suite completed execution without critical errors, and the core functionality was verified through the test results."
