"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully with all 82 tests passing. The output shows that Vitest ran multiple test files (8 in total) and completed without any framework-level errors. The test report structure is complete, showing the number of tests passed, duration, and other relevant details.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The successful build (`yarn build`) and test execution confirm that the core functionality is working. The project was built without errors, and the tests cover key modules like `createStore`, `combineReducers`, `bindActionCreators`, and `applyMiddleware`, which are fundamental to Redux's operation. The ability to import and use these modules is implicitly verified by the test suite's success.\n\nBoth success criteria are fully met - the test suite completed execution and core functionality was verified through the test results. The environment configuration is correct and operational."
