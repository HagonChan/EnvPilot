"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The PHPUnit test suite was successfully executed, completing all 1800 tests with 2644 assertions and only 1 skipped test. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully, even with some individual test failures or skips.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The environment was properly configured with PHP 7.4, Composer, and required extensions. Dependencies were installed successfully, and the test suite ran without critical errors, indicating that the core functionality of the project is operational. The ability to import and use main functional modules is implied by the successful test execution.\n\nThe agent successfully configured the environment and verified both test suite execution and core functionality, meeting all success criteria."
