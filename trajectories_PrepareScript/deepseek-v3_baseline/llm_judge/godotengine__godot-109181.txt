"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully in headless mode, with all 1239 test cases passing and no failures. The output confirms that the testing framework generated a complete test report structure, meeting the first success criterion.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The Godot Engine was successfully built from source, and the editor binary was generated. Although the editor couldn't launch in a graphical environment due to missing X11 display, the core functionality was verified by running tests in headless mode, which demonstrated that the main functional modules are operational. This meets the second success criterion.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful as both conditions are satisfied: the test suite completed execution, and core functionality was verified."
