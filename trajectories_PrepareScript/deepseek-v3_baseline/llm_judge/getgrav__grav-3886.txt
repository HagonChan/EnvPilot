"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed using `vendor/bin/codecept run`, with all 208 tests passing and 1862 assertions. The test framework (Codeception) generated a complete test report structure, confirming that the test suite completed successfully.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules were verified through the successful execution of the test suite, which included unit tests for various components (Assets, Browser, Composer, Blueprint, GPM, Excerpts, Inflector, etc.). The core functionality was demonstrated to be working as expected, with no fundamental import or execution failures.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria: the test suite completed successfully, and core functionality was verified. Individual test failures were not present, and the agent did not exceed the maximum call limit while achieving basic functionality."
