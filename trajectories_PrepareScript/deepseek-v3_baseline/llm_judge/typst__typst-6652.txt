"PASSED\n1. Test Suite Execution: The agent successfully executed the test suite using `cargo test --workspace`, which completed with all tests passing. The output shows multiple test suites running (unit tests, doc tests) across different crates in the workspace, with a complete test report structure generated.\n2. Core Functionality Verification: The project was successfully built from source using `cargo build`, indicating core modules can be compiled and imported. The successful test execution further confirms that basic functionality is working as expected. The agent followed the CI configuration precisely, installing all necessary dependencies (Rust toolchain, gcc-multilib, libssl-dev, pkg-config) before building and testing.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria - test suites completed successfully and core functionality was verified through successful compilation and test execution."
