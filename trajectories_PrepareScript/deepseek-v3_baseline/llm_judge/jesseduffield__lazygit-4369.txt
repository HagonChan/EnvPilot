"PASSED\nDetailed Reasoning:\n1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):\n- The agent successfully executed the unit tests using `go test ./... -short -cover` command\n- Multiple test suites completed with coverage reports (e.g., 36.0% coverage for git_commands, 76.2% for hosting_service)\n- The test framework generated complete output showing which packages passed/failed\n- While some packages had 0% coverage, this doesn't constitute a framework failure\n\n2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):\n- The environment was properly configured with Go 1.22.x\n- The project's main modules were successfully compiled and tested\n- Basic functionality was demonstrated through the test execution\n- The test output shows the core packages were operational (e.g., commands, config, gui components)\n\nThe agent met both success criteria by:\n1. Running a complete test suite that finished execution\n2. Verifying core functionality through test execution\n3. Properly configuring the Go environment\n4. Following the repository's CI configuration for testing"
