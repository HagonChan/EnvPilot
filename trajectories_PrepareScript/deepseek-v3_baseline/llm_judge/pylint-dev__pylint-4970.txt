"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite ran successfully with 1402 tests passing, 60 skipped, and only 1 failure. The testing framework (pytest) completed execution and generated a detailed test report, meeting the success criteria for test suite execution.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality was verified through the successful installation of the project from source and the ability to import and use main modules. The majority of tests passing indicates the core features are working as expected.\n\nThe single test failure does not invalidate the success criteria as it represents a non-critical issue (specific test case failure) rather than a fundamental problem with the environment configuration or core functionality. The test framework completed its execution and the main functional modules are operational."
