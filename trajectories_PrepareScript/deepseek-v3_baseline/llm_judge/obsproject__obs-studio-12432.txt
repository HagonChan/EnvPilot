"FAILED\nDetailed Reasoning:\n1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):** The agent was unable to execute any test suite. The project requires CMake 3.28 or higher, but the environment only had CMake 3.22.1. Attempts to upgrade CMake failed due to network restrictions (SSL connection issues). Without the required CMake version, the build process could not proceed, and no tests were executed.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):** The agent did not verify any core functionality. The build process failed at the configuration stage due to the CMake version mismatch, preventing any modules from being built or imported. No API calls or core features were tested.\n\nThe environment configuration failed because neither of the success criteria was met. The primary blocker was the inability to install the required CMake version, which prevented both test execution and core functionality verification."
