"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The Maven build successfully executed tests for all modules except the packaging module, which was intentionally skipped. The build output indicates that the tests passed without issues, confirming that the test suite completed successfully.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project was built from source, and the core modules (core, GREL, main, server, extensions) were compiled and tested successfully. This confirms that the core functionality can be imported and used normally.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria:\n- At least one complete test suite executed and finished successfully (as evidenced by the Maven build output).\n- Core functional modules were built and tested successfully, indicating they can be imported and used normally."
