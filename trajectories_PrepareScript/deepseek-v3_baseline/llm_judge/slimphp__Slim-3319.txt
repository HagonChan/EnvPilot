"PASSED\nDetailed Reasoning:\n1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):\n- The PHPUnit test suite executed successfully, running 432 tests with 6 skipped\n- The test framework generated a complete report showing all tests completed (OK status)\n- While there were some skipped tests, this doesn't prevent the suite from completing\n\n2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):\n- All dependencies were successfully installed via Composer\n- The main test suite could be executed, indicating core modules were properly imported\n- The test results show assertions were made (789 assertions), demonstrating basic functionality works\n- The environment was properly configured as evidenced by the successful test execution\n\nThe environment meets both success criteria:\n- At least one complete test suite executed (PHPUnit)\n- Core functionality was verified through test execution\n- Despite some skipped tests, the fundamental requirements are satisfied"
