"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed using the command `CGO_ENABLED=1 go run build.go test`. The output shows that multiple test packages were run, and all tests passed (e.g., `ok` status for all test packages). This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project was successfully built using `go run build.go`, and the test execution confirms that the core functionality is operational. The test output includes successful runs of core modules like `github.com/syncthing/syncthing/lib/model`, `github.com/syncthing/syncthing/lib/fs`, and others, indicating that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful as both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) are satisfied. The agent successfully installed Go, resolved dependencies (including `gcc` for `cgo`), built the project, and ran the tests without critical errors."
