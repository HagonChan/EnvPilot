"FAILED\n\nDetailed Reasoning:\n1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**:\n   - The agent attempted multiple approaches to run the test suite but consistently failed to execute any complete test suite. Various methods including using `composer test`, `simple-phpunit`, and direct PHPUnit invocation all resulted in failures due to timeouts, missing extensions, or inaccessible executables.\n   - While dependencies were successfully installed, the test framework could not be properly initialized or executed to generate a complete test report structure.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**:\n   - The agent did not demonstrate successful import or usage of any core functional modules. The focus remained entirely on test execution attempts without verifying basic API functionality or module imports.\n   - No example code execution was shown to verify core features were working as expected.\n\nThe environment configuration cannot be considered successful because:\n- No test suite completed execution (violates Condition 1)\n- No core functionality was verified (violates Condition 2)\n- Multiple critical failures occurred during the setup process including missing PHP extensions and inaccessible test executables\n\nWhile significant progress was made in dependency installation, the fundamental requirements for success were not met. The agent encountered persistent issues that prevented both test execution and core functionality verification."
