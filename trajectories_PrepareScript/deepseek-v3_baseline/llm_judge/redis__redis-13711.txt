"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite (`make test`) completed successfully, as evidenced by the output \"\\\\o/ All tests passed without errors!\" This confirms that the test framework executed and generated a complete test report structure, meeting the first success criterion.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The Redis server was successfully built (`make REDIS_CFLAGS='-Werror' BUILD_TLS=yes MALLOC=libc`), and the test suite verified core functionality (e.g., basic commands, data structures, replication). This meets the second success criterion, as the main functional modules are operational.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The build process required troubleshooting (installing dependencies like `libssl-dev` and `libjemalloc-dev`, and setting `MALLOC=libc`), but the final configuration passed all tests.\n- The test suite included unit tests, integration tests, and stress tests, covering a wide range of Redis functionality.\n- The agent followed the repository's CI/CD configuration and README instructions to achieve a successful setup."
