"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite (`cargo test --all`) completed successfully with all 924 tests passing. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, and the suite finished execution without critical errors.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules were imported and used normally. The core features were demonstrated through successful test execution, and basic API calls returned expected results. The project was successfully compiled and installed from source.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning:\n- **Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution)**: The test suite ran to completion, and all tests passed after resolving initial issues (missing `cc`, Python 3, and the `USER` environment variable). The test output confirms that the suite executed fully, meeting the success criteria.\n- **Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification)**: The project was built successfully (`cargo build`), and the core functionality was verified through the test suite. The ability to run tests and compile the project confirms that the core modules are functional.\n\n### Notes:\n- Initial failures (e.g., missing `cc`, Python 3, and environment variables) were resolved during the configuration process.\n- The final test run showed 924 passed tests, 0 failures, and 7 ignored tests, which is acceptable under the success criteria (individual test failures are allowed as long as the suite completes). In this case, there were no failures."
