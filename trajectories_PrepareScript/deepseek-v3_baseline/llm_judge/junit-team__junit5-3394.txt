"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The Gradle build successfully executed multiple test suites (494 tasks executed, including tests). Although 2 tests failed due to timeouts, the test framework completed execution and generated a test report (as evidenced by the failure message pointing to `file:///home/junit5/platform-tooling-support-tests/build/reports/tests/test/index.html`). This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite finish execution.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The build process successfully compiled all modules (including core components like `junit-jupiter-api`, `junit-platform-engine`, etc.), and the majority of tests passed. The ability to generate a JaCoCo coverage report further confirms core functionality is operational. The test failures were related to auxiliary tooling tests (Maven/Gradle integration) rather than core JUnit functionality.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful because:\n- The test framework completed execution (despite some test failures)\n- Core modules were built and testable\n- The project's main functionality was verified through the build process\n- Test coverage reports were generated successfully"
