"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The Maven test suite (`mvn test`) completed successfully without any failures. The Ant test suite (`ant junit`) also executed, though some individual test cases failed. The test framework generated a complete test report structure in `/testbed/java/build/junitreport`, including detailed XML and HTML reports for all test classes.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules were successfully built and could be imported/used as demonstrated by:\n   - Successful Maven build (`mvn install -DskipTests`)\n   - Successful execution of core test cases (majority passed in both Maven and Ant)\n   - Generation of JAR files and other build artifacts\n   - The ability to run both Maven and Ant test frameworks\n\nWhile some Ant tests failed (which is acceptable per the success criteria), the critical requirements are met:\n- At least one complete test suite (Maven) executed successfully\n- Core functionality was verified through successful builds and partial test execution\n- The testing infrastructure worked as evidenced by report generation\n- No critical errors preventing test execution or core functionality were encountered"
