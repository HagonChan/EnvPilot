"FAILED\n\nDetailed Reasoning:\n\n1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):\n- The Maven build process failed to complete successfully. While some modules were built, the main graylog2-server module failed with test errors (541 errors, 3 failures out of 3798 tests).\n- The test suite did not complete successfully due to multiple issues including Docker-related errors (ContainerFetch) and frontend build failures.\n- The testing framework generated reports, but the suite did not finish in a successful state as required by the success criteria.\n\n2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):\n- The core functionality could not be properly verified because:\n  - The main graylog2-server module failed to build completely\n  - The frontend build process failed\n  - Docker-dependent components couldn't be tested due to Docker configuration issues\n- While some modules were built successfully, the critical graylog2-server module failed, preventing verification of core functionality.\n\n3. Additional Observations:\n- The environment was partially configured (Java 17 and Maven installed)\n- Docker installation was attempted but couldn't be properly configured due to system limitations\n- The build process encountered multiple failures that couldn't be resolved within the task constraints\n- The agent made reasonable attempts to resolve issues but was ultimately unsuccessful in achieving a fully functional environment\n\nThe configuration does not meet either of the two required success conditions, resulting in a FAILED evaluation."
