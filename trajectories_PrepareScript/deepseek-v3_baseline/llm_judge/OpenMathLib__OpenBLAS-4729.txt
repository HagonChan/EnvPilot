"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The build process completed successfully, and the tests for BLAS, CBLAS, LAPACK, and LAPACKE routines were executed. The output shows that all computational tests passed, and the test suite completed without errors. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The library was successfully built and installed to `/usr/local`. The verification step confirmed that the library files (`libopenblas.a`, `libopenblas.so`, etc.) are correctly installed and the dynamic linker cache was updated. This demonstrates that the core functionality of the library is operational and can be used normally.\n\nBoth conditions for successful environment configuration are satisfied. The project is fully functional, and the tests have been executed successfully."
