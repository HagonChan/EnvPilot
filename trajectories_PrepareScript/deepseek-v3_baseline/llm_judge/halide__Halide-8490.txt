"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully built the project and executed the internal test suite (`make`), which completed with all tests passing (\"Success!\"). Additionally, the majority of the end-to-end tests (`make run_tests`) were compiled and executed successfully, with only one test failing due to hardware-specific SIMD operations.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project's core functionality was verified through the successful execution of the internal test suite, which tests fundamental components like IR printing, code generation, bounds checking, and more. The ability to build and run these tests confirms that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally.\n\nThe environment configuration meets the success criteria as both conditions are satisfied: at least one complete test suite executed successfully, and core functionality was verified. The single test failure is not critical as it's related to specific hardware support rather than fundamental functionality."
