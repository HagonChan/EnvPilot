"PASSED\nDetailed Reasoning:\n1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**:\n   - Multiple test suites were successfully executed, including `flb-it-parser`, `flb-it-aws_credentials`, `flb-it-stream_processor`, and `flb-it-metrics`.\n   - All tests completed with \"[ OK ]\" status and the message \"SUCCESS: All unit tests have passed\".\n   - The test framework generated complete output with detailed test case results.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**:\n   - The project built successfully after resolving dependency issues (installing cmake, gcc, etc.).\n   - Core modules were compiled and test executables were generated in the `bin` directory.\n   - Example test executions demonstrated functional API calls and expected results (e.g., AWS credential handling, stream processing).\n\n3. **Success Criteria Met**:\n   - Both conditions are satisfied: at least one complete test suite executed successfully and core functionality was verified through multiple test cases.\n   - While there were initial build challenges (mbedtls warnings), these were resolved without modifying test cases or core functionality.\n\n4. **Failure Conditions Avoided**:\n   - No critical errors preventing test execution or core functionality.\n   - All attempted test suites completed execution, even if some individual test cases showed non-critical warnings.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful as it meets both required criteria for test suite execution and core functionality verification."
