"PASSED\n\nDetailed Reasoning:\n1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**:\n   - The test suite (`./vendor/bin/pest`) executed successfully, completing all 541 tests without any failures. The testing framework generated a complete test report structure, including detailed information about each test case's execution time and status.\n   - The initial failure due to the missing GD extension was resolved by installing the required package (`php8.2-gd`), and subsequent test runs confirmed all tests passed.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**:\n   - The core functional modules were successfully imported and used, as evidenced by the test suite execution. The tests covered various aspects of the application, including actions, forms, tables, and other core features.\n   - Basic API calls and core features were demonstrated through the test cases, which verified the functionality of the application's main components.\n\nBoth conditions for successful environment configuration have been met:\n- The test suite completed execution with all tests passing.\n- Core functionality was verified through the test cases, confirming that the main modules and features are operational."
