"PASSED\nDetailed Reasoning:\n1. Test Suite Execution: The test suite completed successfully with 1610 passing tests and only 8 skipped tests (which were expected skips due to missing optional features). The test framework generated a complete report structure showing totals for passed, failed, and skipped tests.\n\n2. Core Functionality Verification: The project compiled successfully and the main functional modules were verified through the test execution. The bintest results (100% pass rate) confirm core functionality is working as expected.\n\nThe environment meets both success criteria:\n- At least one complete test suite executed and finished (mrbtest and bintest)\n- Core functionality was verified through successful compilation and test execution\n- The agent did not exceed maximum call limits\n- No critical errors preventing test execution occurred\n\nThe skipped tests are non-critical as they relate to optional features (like mruby-proc-ext) and are explicitly marked as expected skips in the test output."
