"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed using `tox` with the `py311` environment. The tests completed without errors after applying the patch to the `werkzeug` module, which resolved the `AttributeError` related to `werkzeug.__version__`. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, and the suite finished successfully.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality of the project was verified by running the test suite, which includes tests for various modules and features. The successful execution of the tests indicates that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally, and basic API calls return expected results. Additionally, the patch script demonstrates that the core features can be executed through example code.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful because both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) were met. The initial issues were resolved by installing the correct dependencies, applying necessary patches, and ensuring the test suite could run to completion."
