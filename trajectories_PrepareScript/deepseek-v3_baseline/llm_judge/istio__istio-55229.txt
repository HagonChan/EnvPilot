"FAILED\n1. Test Suite Execution: The agent was unable to execute any test suite. The process was interrupted due to compatibility issues with the Go version (required >=1.23.0 but running 1.21.1). No test suite was started or completed successfully.\n\n2. Core Functionality Verification: The agent failed to verify core functionality. While dependencies were downloaded, the build process failed due to version incompatibilities. No core modules were successfully imported or demonstrated to work.\n\nThe environment configuration did not meet either success criteria:\n- No test suite execution was achieved\n- No core functionality verification was completed\n- The process was terminated before establishing a working environment\n\nThe main issues were:\n1. Incompatible Go version requirements\n2. Failed build process\n3. Premature termination before resolving version conflicts"
