"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully ran `cargo test` which executed multiple test suites (unit tests, doc tests) across different components of the project. The output shows all tests passed (e.g., \"test result: ok. 223 passed; 0 failed\" for core tests, and similar success for other components). This meets the requirement of having at least one complete test suite execute successfully with a complete test report structure.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The successful build (`cargo build`) and test execution demonstrate that:\n   - All core modules could be imported and compiled without errors\n   - The main functional modules (core, contrib, etc.) were exercised during testing\n   - The test output shows API functionality being verified (e.g., URI parsing tests, websocket tests)\n   - No fundamental import or compilation errors were encountered\n\nThe agent followed the correct procedure by:\n- Identifying the CI configuration for setup instructions\n- Installing all required dependencies (Rust, native libraries)\n- Successfully resolving build issues (installing gcc)\n- Executing the full test suite as specified in the project's CI configuration"
