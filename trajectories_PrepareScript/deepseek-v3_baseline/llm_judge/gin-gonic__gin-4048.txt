"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully with all test cases passing. The output shows a comprehensive test report with all tests marked as \"PASS\" and a coverage of 99.2%. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality was verified through the execution of the test suite, which includes tests for various modules like authentication, context handling, routing, and more. The successful execution of these tests confirms that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally, and basic API calls return expected results.\n\nThe environment configuration was successful as both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) were met. The agent correctly installed the required Go version, set up the environment, and executed the tests as specified in the repository's CI/CD configuration and Makefile."
