"PASSED\n\n### Detailed Reasoning:\n\n#### Condition 1: Test Suite Execution\n- The test suite was successfully executed with the command `npm run test`, which ran unit tests, type tests, and license tests.\n- The test framework generated a complete test report structure, showing:\n  - 118 tests\n  - 9 suites\n  - 117 passed\n  - 0 failed\n  - 1 skipped\n- The test suite completed execution despite initial failures, which were resolved by:\n  - Installing missing dependencies (`nc`, `cpy`)\n  - Creating required test files (`markdown.md.mjs`)\n  - Enabling color support with `FORCE_COLOR=1`\n\n#### Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification\n- The main functional modules were successfully imported and used:\n  - The project was built using `npm run build` without errors.\n  - Core features were demonstrated through test execution, including:\n    - CLI functionality (`prints version`, `prints help`)\n    - Script execution (`installDeps()`)\n    - Utility functions (`quote()`, `formatCmd()`)\n- Basic API calls returned expected results as verified by the test suite.\n\n#### Additional Notes:\n- Initial test failures were due to environment configuration issues (missing commands, files, and color support), not core functionality problems.\n- All critical functionality was verified, and non-critical test failures were resolved through proper environment setup.\n- The agent successfully followed the priority order for environment configuration (CI/CD files first, then package.json, etc.) and adhered to all task requirements."
