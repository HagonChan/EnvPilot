"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite `./flattests` executed successfully and completed with the output \"ALL TESTS PASSED\". This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project was successfully built using `g++-12` and `cmake`, and the main functional modules were compiled without errors. The successful execution of the test suite further confirms that the core functionality is working as expected.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful as both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) are satisfied. The agent successfully installed the necessary dependencies, configured the project, built it, and ran the tests, all of which completed without critical errors."
