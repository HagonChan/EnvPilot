"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed multiple test suites including linting (`yarn test:lint`), type checking (`yarn test:flow`), and Jest unit tests with coverage (`yarn test:jest --coverage`). All test suites completed successfully with 8 passed test suites, 1204 passed tests, and 121 passed snapshots. The Jest coverage report was also generated, indicating comprehensive test execution.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The environment was properly configured with Node.js 16, yarn, and all project dependencies installed from source. The successful execution of the test suites confirms that the core functionality is operational. The agent also verified that the main modules could be imported and used normally by running the test commands specified in the CI workflow.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria, as the test suites completed successfully and the core functionality was verified through the execution of the tests."
