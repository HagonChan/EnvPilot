"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed, as evidenced by the test runner completing its run and generating detailed test reports. While some tests failed, the test framework (Playwright) was able to start, execute, and finish the test suite, which meets the success criteria for test execution.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality of the project was verified through the successful installation of dependencies, building of the project (`npm run build:prod`), and the ability to start the webpack development server (`npm start`). The test failures were related to specific test assertions rather than fundamental issues with the project's core functionality.\n\nThe environment was correctly configured with Node.js 18.x, all necessary dependencies were installed, and the test suite ran to completion. The test failures appear to be related to the test logic or mocked responses rather than environment configuration issues. Therefore, the environment configuration task is considered successful."
