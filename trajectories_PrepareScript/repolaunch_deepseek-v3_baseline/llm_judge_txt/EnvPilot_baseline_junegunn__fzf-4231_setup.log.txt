PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The output shows successful execution of multiple test suites (github.com/junegunn/fzf/src, github.com/junegunn/fzf/src/algo, github.com/junegunn/fzf/src/tui, github.com/junegunn/fzf/src/util) with "ok" status and execution times reported. This meets Condition 1 as at least one complete test suite executed successfully and generated test reports.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The successful installation of Go 1.20, downloading of dependencies via 'go mod download', and passing tests indicate the core functionality is working. The test results specifically show the main functional modules (src, algo, tui, util) are operational, meeting Condition 2. While some packages had no test files, this doesn't indicate failure as the core modules were verified.

The environment configuration successfully met both criteria - test suites completed execution and core functionality was verified through test execution and module imports. The agent completed the setup within reasonable time without hitting call limits.
