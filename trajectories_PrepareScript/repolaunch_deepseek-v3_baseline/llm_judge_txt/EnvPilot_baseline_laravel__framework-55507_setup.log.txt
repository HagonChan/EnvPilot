FAILED
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): Not met - The agent was unable to install the required PHP packages and dependencies due to repeated timeouts during the tzdata configuration. No test suite could be executed as the basic environment setup failed.
2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): Not met - The agent couldn't progress to the stage of verifying core functionality because the fundamental PHP environment couldn't be installed. The process timed out before reaching any module import or API verification steps.
3. The agent exceeded the maximum time limit (2 hours) without achieving either of the success criteria, making multiple unsuccessful attempts to resolve the tzdata installation issue.
4. The failure was fundamental - the system couldn't even complete the basic package installation required for the environment, let alone proceed to test execution or functionality verification.
