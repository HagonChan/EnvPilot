PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The agent successfully ran a subset of unit tests (233 tests) from the LexicalSelection.test.tsx file, with all tests passing. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria as it demonstrates that at least one complete test suite can start, execute, and finish successfully.

2. Core Functionality Verification: While the output doesn't explicitly show core module imports or API calls, the successful execution of a substantial number of unit tests implies that the core functionality is working as expected. The tests wouldn't pass if the fundamental modules were broken or couldn't be imported properly. The agent also successfully installed all dependencies and upgraded Node.js to a compatible version, which are prerequisites for core functionality.

The initial timeout issues with running all tests appear to be related to resource constraints rather than environment configuration problems, as evidenced by the successful execution of a subset of tests. The agent demonstrated the ability to properly configure the environment by resolving Node.js version conflicts and installing all necessary dependencies.
