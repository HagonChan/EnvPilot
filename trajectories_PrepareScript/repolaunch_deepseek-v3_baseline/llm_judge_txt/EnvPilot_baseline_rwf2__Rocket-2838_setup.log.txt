PASSED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The output shows that multiple test suites completed successfully with all tests passing (223 tests in rocket_http, 12 in rocket_sync_db_pools, and 14 in rocket_ws). The testing framework generated complete test reports for each suite.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The project built successfully (cargo build completed without errors) and all tests passed, indicating the core functionality is working as expected. The agent was able to import and use all necessary modules, and the basic API calls returned expected results as demonstrated by the test executions.

The environment configuration meets both success criteria despite some warnings during compilation, as warnings don't affect the fundamental operation of the test suites or core functionality. The agent successfully installed all required dependencies (Rust toolchain, system libraries, build tools) and configured the environment properly.
