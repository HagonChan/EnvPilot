FAILED
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): Not met - The agent was unable to successfully install PHP and Composer due to persistent timeout issues during package installation. No test suite could be executed as the basic environment setup failed.
2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): Not met - The agent couldn't progress far enough to verify any core functionality. The environment wasn't properly configured to even attempt importing modules or making API calls.
3. The agent encountered repeated timeout errors during package installation attempts, suggesting network connectivity issues with the package repositories. Multiple approaches were tried (different mirrors, non-interactive mode, minimal installations) but all failed due to the same timeout problem.
4. The session ultimately reached the global 2-hour timeout limit without achieving either of the success criteria. No meaningful progress was made beyond the initial package installation attempts.
