FAILED
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): Not met - The agent was unable to successfully install the required dependencies (PHP, Composer, and extensions) due to persistent timeout issues. Without these dependencies, no test suite could be executed or completed.

2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): Not met - The agent couldn't progress far enough to verify core functionality because the basic environment setup (PHP installation) failed repeatedly due to timeout errors. No module imports or API calls could be tested.

The environment configuration failed because:
- All installation attempts timed out before completing
- No dependencies were successfully installed
- The agent reached the global 2-hour timeout limit without achieving basic functionality
- Neither test execution nor core functionality verification was possible due to the failed setup

The timeout issues with package installation (particularly tzdata configuration) prevented any meaningful progress in setting up the environment. The agent exhausted all available time without establishing a working baseline environment.
