PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The output shows that the test suite completed successfully with "BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 10m 15s" and "286 actionable tasks: 268 executed, 18 from cache". The test report indicates "119 tests completed, 2 skipped", which means the test suite executed to completion and generated a complete test report structure.

2. Core Functionality Verification: While the detailed test results aren't shown, the successful build execution and test completion demonstrate that the core functional modules could be imported and used normally. The fact that the tests ran to completion (even with some skipped tests) indicates the basic API calls and core features were operational enough to execute the test suite.

The agent successfully resolved version conflicts (Gradle 8.13 vs 7.6.2, Java 21 vs 17) and ultimately achieved a working environment where tests could execute. The two skipped tests don't constitute a failure as per the success criteria, which focuses on framework operability rather than individual test pass rates.
