PASSED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The output shows multiple test suites executing successfully with "ok" status and completion reports (e.g., "ok github.com/prometheus/prometheus/cmd/prometheus 23.592s"). While there was one test failure in the scrape package, this is considered non-critical as the test suites completed execution and generated reports.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The agent successfully installed Go, resolved version conflicts, downloaded dependencies, and executed the test suites. The core functionality is verified by the successful execution of tests across multiple packages (cmd, config, discovery, etc.) and the ability to import and use Go modules.

The single test failure does not indicate a fundamental environment setup problem but rather appears to be a specific test case issue. Both success criteria are met.
