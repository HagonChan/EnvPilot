PASSED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The output shows that the test suite executed successfully with 'rake all test' and 'rake test:run:serial'. The test results indicate 1610 tests passed (OK) with 8 skipped tests, and 0 failures (KO) or crashes. The bintest also passed all 100 tests. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The build process completed successfully, generating binaries like mrbc and mruby. The test output shows the project's core functionality is working as expected, with the main modules being tested and passing. The detailed build summary confirms all essential components were included and built correctly.

The environment configuration successfully met both criteria: the test suite completed execution and core functionality was verified to be working. The skipped tests are non-critical (as indicated by the output) and don't affect the fundamental operation of the system.
