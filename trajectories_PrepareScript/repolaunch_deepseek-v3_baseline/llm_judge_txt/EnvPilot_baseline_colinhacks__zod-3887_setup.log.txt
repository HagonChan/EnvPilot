PASSED

Detailed reasoning:
1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):
- The test suite successfully executed with all 57 test suites passing and 488 tests completed
- The Jest testing framework generated a complete test report structure showing the progress and final results
- The test execution took 55.797 seconds and completed without errors

2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):
- The project dependencies were successfully installed using yarn
- The test command "yarn test:ts-jest" ran without any fundamental errors
- The test results demonstrate that the core functionality is working as expected
- The environment was properly configured with Node.js v18.20.8 and npm v10.8.2

The environment configuration meets both success criteria:
1. The test suite executed completely and successfully
2. The core functionality was verified through the passing test cases
The optional dependency warning about unix-dgram does not affect the core functionality or test execution.
