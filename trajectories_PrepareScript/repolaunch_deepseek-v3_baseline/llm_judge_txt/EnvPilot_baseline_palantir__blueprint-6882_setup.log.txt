FAILED

1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - Not met
- No test suite was executed at all
- The agent couldn't even complete the environment setup phase
- The process timed out while trying to install Yarn dependencies

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - Not met
- Core modules were never imported or tested
- The project dependencies were never installed
- Basic API calls were never attempted

The agent failed to complete the basic environment setup due to:
- Repeated timeouts when trying to install Yarn via Corepack
- Inability to bypass interactive prompts in the automated environment
- Network issues that prevented package downloads
- Ultimately reached the global 2-hour timeout without achieving either success criterion

The environment configuration was not completed successfully as neither test execution nor core functionality verification was achieved. The agent got stuck in the dependency installation phase and couldn't progress to actual testing or functionality verification.
