PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The output shows that multiple test suites were executed successfully (e.g., dfly_core_test, compact_object_test, dragonfly_test, etc.). The test framework generated complete reports and all 60 tests passed, with only one test being skipped (which is acceptable). This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The successful build process (including compilation of core modules like dragonfly executable) and the passing of functional tests (like search_family_test, string_family_test, etc.) demonstrate that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally. The test results verify that basic API calls return expected results and core features are working, meeting Condition 2 of the success criteria.

The environment configuration is successful because:
- Multiple test suites completed execution with passing results
- Core functionality was verified through extensive test coverage
- The build process completed successfully producing all required executables
- No critical errors (import failures or framework issues) were encountered
