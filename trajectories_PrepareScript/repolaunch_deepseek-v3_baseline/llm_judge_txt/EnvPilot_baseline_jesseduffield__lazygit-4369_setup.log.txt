PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The output shows multiple test suites completed successfully with "ok" status (e.g., github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pkg/cheatsheet, github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pkg/commands/git_commands, etc.). While some tests were skipped due to Git version requirements and there was an initial failure due to missing Git configuration, the tests ultimately completed successfully after configuring Git user identity.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The successful execution of multiple test packages (e.g., git_commands, git_config, hosting_service, etc.) demonstrates that core functional modules can be imported and used normally. The fact that the test suites could run to completion indicates the basic API calls and core features are working as expected.

The environment configuration meets both success criteria despite initial setup challenges and some skipped tests. The agent successfully installed Go 1.22, configured the PATH, set up Git identity, and ultimately achieved successful test execution across multiple packages.
