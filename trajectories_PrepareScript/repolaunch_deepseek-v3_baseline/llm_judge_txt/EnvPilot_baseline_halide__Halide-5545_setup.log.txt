FAILED

Detailed Reasoning:
1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):
- The build process consistently fails with various compilation errors (HVX, OpenGL, profiler, x86 assembly)
- No test suite completes execution as the build never reaches the testing phase
- The errors prevent generation of any test report structure

2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):
- Core modules fail to compile due to multiple issues:
  * HVX-related compilation failures
  * OpenGL compilation errors
  * Profiler unused variable warnings
  * x86 assembly verification problems
- The build process terminates before any core functionality can be verified
- No evidence that basic API calls or imports would work

The environment configuration fails both success criteria:
- No test suite completes execution
- Core modules fail to compile, preventing any functionality verification
- The agent exhausted multiple attempts to fix the issues but couldn't achieve a working build

The failure persists despite attempts to:
- Disable problematic components (HVX, OpenGL, profiler)
- Modify source code to fix compilation warnings
- Adjust build flags and configurations

The fundamental build issues prevent meeting either success condition.
