FAILED

1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - FAILED
- No test suite was executed at all during the configuration process
- The agent couldn't even install basic prerequisites (Rust, curl, wget, Python) due to network connectivity issues
- No testing framework was set up or run

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - FAILED
- The agent failed to install Rust, which appears to be a core requirement
- Basic tools like curl, wget and Python weren't available and couldn't be installed
- No core functionality could be verified as the environment wasn't properly configured
- The system couldn't even reach the basic package repositories due to network issues

The environment configuration failed completely due to:
- Persistent network connectivity issues preventing package installation
- Inability to install any required tools (Rust, curl, wget, Python)
- No successful execution of any test suite
- No verification of core functionality possible

The agent exhausted all reasonable attempts to configure the environment but was ultimately blocked by fundamental network issues that prevented any meaningful progress.
