PASSED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The output shows that the test suite executed successfully with all tests passing ("[  PASSED  ] 2 tests"). The test framework generated a complete report structure with setup, test execution, and tear-down phases.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The project was successfully built using CMake and make, indicating the core modules can be compiled. The successful test execution further verifies that the basic functionality is working as expected. The agent installed all necessary dependencies (cmake, g++, JDK, maven, and various development libraries) and followed the project's build instructions correctly.

The environment configuration meets both success criteria: the test suite completed successfully and the core functionality was verified through successful compilation and test execution. The initial warnings about missing packages (like absl) did not prevent the successful build and test execution.
