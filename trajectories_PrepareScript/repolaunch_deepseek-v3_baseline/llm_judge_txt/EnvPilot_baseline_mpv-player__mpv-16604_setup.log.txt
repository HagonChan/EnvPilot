FAILED

1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):
- The build process completed successfully, but no test suite was executed
- Meson reported "No tests defined" during the build process
- Attempts to run tests manually via `make test` failed as no test rules were defined
- No test report structure was generated

2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):
- The project built successfully with all dependencies resolved
- However, we cannot confirm core functionality works as no tests or example executions were performed
- The agent stopped after the build without verifying any actual functionality

The environment configuration partially succeeded in building the project but failed to meet both success criteria since:
1. No test suite was executed (Condition 1 not met)
2. Core functionality was not verified through any execution (Condition 2 not met)

While the build was successful, the absence of test execution and functionality verification means we cannot confirm the environment is properly configured for actual use.
