PASSED

1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution
- The agent successfully executed `mvn test` which ran multiple test suites across different modules (Gson, GraalVM Native Image, Code shrinking, etc.)
- While the test-jpms module failed, other test suites completed successfully and generated test reports
- The Maven build output shows successful test execution for other modules, meeting the requirement of at least one complete test suite finishing

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification
- The agent successfully built the main Gson module using `mvn install -DskipTests`
- The build completed without errors, indicating core modules can be compiled and packaged
- The successful test execution in other modules demonstrates core functionality is working
- The build output shows all modules were successfully processed, including the main Gson implementation

The failure in test-jpms appears to be module-specific and doesn't affect the overall success criteria, as other test suites completed and core functionality was verified. The agent properly installed Java and Maven, built the project, and executed tests, meeting both success conditions.
