FAILED

Detailed Reasoning:

1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):
- Multiple test suites failed to complete successfully due to fundamental issues:
  - Go version incompatibility (requires 1.20+ but using 1.18)
  - Missing external services (Redis, Memcached) causing connection refused errors
  - Missing configuration files (app.conf)
- While some test suites did complete (marked as "ok"), the critical failures in core components prevent overall success

2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):
- Several core modules failed to build or import properly:
  - Build failures in server/web and related components
  - Configuration system failures due to missing files
  - Cache system failures due to missing dependencies
- The fundamental Go version mismatch prevents proper execution of modern Go features

3. Key Failure Indicators:
- Multiple "build failed" messages for core components
- Docker/Docker-compose setup failed to properly initialize
- Persistent Go version compatibility errors
- Critical services unavailable (Redis, Memcached)

4. Successful Aspects:
- Some independent test suites did pass (admin, bean, berror, etc.)
- Basic environment setup (Go installation, Docker installation) was completed
- The test framework was able to execute and report results

Conclusion:
The environment configuration does not meet the success criteria because:
1. No complete test suite executed successfully without critical errors
2. Core functionality cannot be verified due to build failures and missing dependencies
3. Fundamental system requirements (Go version) are not met
