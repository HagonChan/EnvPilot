FAILED
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): Not met - The agent was unable to even install basic dependencies (Go, git, etc.) due to container environment issues. No test suite could be started or executed.
2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): Not met - The system became completely unresponsive, with even basic commands like checking the OS version timing out. No core functionality could be verified.

The environment configuration failed because:
- The container environment had fundamental issues that prevented basic package installation
- The system became completely unresponsive before any meaningful setup could be completed
- Neither test suite execution nor core functionality verification was possible
- The agent had to stop due to persistent timeouts and system unresponsiveness
