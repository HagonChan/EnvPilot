     - Rendered output tests (36 tests) all passed
     - Testing module tests (4 tests) all passed
     - Example preprocessor tests passed
     - Documentation tests (5 tests) all passed
   - The testing framework generated complete test reports for all suites

2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):**
   - The project built successfully with `cargo build`
   - All core modules were compiled and linked correctly
   - The test execution demonstrates that core functionality is working:
     - Book loading and parsing
     - Summary generation
     - Rendering functionality
     - Preprocessor system
   - Example code in the project executed successfully

The environment configuration meets both success criteria - test suites completed successfully and core functionality was verified. The agent successfully installed all required dependencies (Rust, Cargo, build-essential) and configured the environment properly for this Rust project.
