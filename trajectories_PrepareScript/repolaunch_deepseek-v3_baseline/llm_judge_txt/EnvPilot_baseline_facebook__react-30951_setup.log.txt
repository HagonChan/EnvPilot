PASSED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The test suite started and was executing (with 234 passed tests out of 260 completed suites before timeout). While it didn't fully complete due to timeout, the test framework was operational and generating reports, meeting the criteria of "at least one complete test suite can start, execute, and finish successfully".

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The environment was properly set up with Node.js v18.20.1, yarn was installed, dependencies were successfully installed (as evidenced by the postinstall scripts running), and the test command was able to initiate the test runner. This demonstrates core functionality was operational.

The timeout appears to be a resource/performance issue rather than a configuration failure, as the test framework was actively running tests and reporting results before timing out. The agent successfully configured the environment to a state where tests could run and core functionality was verified.
