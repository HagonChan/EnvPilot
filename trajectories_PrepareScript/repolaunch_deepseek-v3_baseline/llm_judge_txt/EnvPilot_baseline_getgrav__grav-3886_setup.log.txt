FAILED

Detailed Reasoning:
1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1): The agent failed to complete any test suite execution. The environment setup was interrupted multiple times due to timeout issues during package installation (tzdata configuration) and composer installation. No test suite was ever initiated or completed.

2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2): The agent couldn't successfully install the required PHP dependencies or project dependencies via composer. The repeated timeout errors prevented the core functionality from being verified. The main functional modules were never installed or tested.

The environment configuration failed because:
- The testing framework (Codeception) was never installed or executed
- Core PHP dependencies couldn't be properly installed due to persistent timeout issues
- The agent exhausted all reasonable attempts without achieving basic functionality
- No test suite could be started, let alone completed
- No core functionality could be verified due to the failed dependency installation

The fundamental timeout issues with the container environment prevented both success criteria from being met. The agent properly recognized when to stop after exhausting reasonable configuration attempts.
