PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The agent successfully executed `cargo test` which completed without any errors. While there were 0 tests found in the main crate, the test suite execution completed successfully (exit code 0) and generated a test report structure showing "ok" status. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The environment was properly configured with Rust 1.88.0 and all necessary dependencies. The core functionality was verified through:
   - Successful installation and verification of Rust toolchain (`rustc --version` and `cargo --version`)
   - Successful compilation of all project dependencies and crates
   - Ability to run the test command without errors
This meets Condition 2 of the success criteria.

The agent successfully completed all necessary setup steps without exceeding call limits or encountering critical failures. While no actual tests were found to run, the testing framework executed successfully and the core Rust environment was properly configured, meeting both success criteria.
