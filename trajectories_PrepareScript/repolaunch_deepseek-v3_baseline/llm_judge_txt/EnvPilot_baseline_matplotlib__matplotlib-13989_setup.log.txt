PASSED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The test suite successfully started and executed, collecting 7887 test items with 5461 passing, 1090 failing, and 1327 skipped. This meets the criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully, even with individual test failures.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The matplotlib package was successfully installed in editable mode (pip3 install -e .) and the core functionality appears to be working as evidenced by the large number of passing tests (5461). The agent also demonstrated the ability to import and use core modules by running the test suite.

While there were test failures (particularly image comparison failures) and timeouts during later attempts to run tests, the initial successful test execution with many passing tests demonstrates that the core functionality is working. The failures appear to be related to specific test cases rather than fundamental issues with the environment configuration or core functionality. The timeouts that occurred later were likely due to system-level issues rather than problems with the matplotlib environment configuration itself.
