FAILED
1. Test Suite Execution: The build completed successfully but no tests were found ("No tests were found!!!"). This fails Condition 1 of the success criteria which requires at least one complete test suite to execute.
2. Core Functionality Verification: While the core components were built successfully (libobs and libobs-opengl), we have no evidence that:
   - Main functional modules can be imported and used normally
   - Basic API calls return expected results
   - Core features were demonstrated through example code execution
   The agent stopped after the build without verifying any actual functionality.

The environment configuration cannot be considered successful because:
- No tests were executed (failing Condition 1)
- Core functionality was not verified (failing Condition 2)
- The agent didn't proceed to validate any actual functionality before stopping

While the build itself succeeded, this only represents partial progress toward the full success criteria. Both conditions must be met for a PASSED verdict.
