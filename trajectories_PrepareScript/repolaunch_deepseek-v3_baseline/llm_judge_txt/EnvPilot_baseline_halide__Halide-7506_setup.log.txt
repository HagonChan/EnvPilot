PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The output shows that 42 out of 43 Python tests passed successfully, with only one test failing (python_tutorial_lesson_10_aot_compilation_run). The test suite completed execution and generated a complete test report structure, meeting Condition 1 of the success criteria. The single failure is considered non-critical as it doesn't prevent the overall test suite from completing.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The successful execution of multiple Python tests (including correctness tests and tutorials) demonstrates that the core functional modules can be imported and used normally. The tests cover basic API calls and core features, verifying that the main functionality works as expected, meeting Condition 2 of the success criteria.

The environment configuration is considered successful because:
- The test framework executed to completion
- The vast majority of tests passed
- Core functionality was verified through multiple test cases
- The single failure appears to be an isolated issue rather than a systemic problem
