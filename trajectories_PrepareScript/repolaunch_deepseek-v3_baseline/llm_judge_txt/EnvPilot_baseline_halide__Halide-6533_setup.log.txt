FAILED
1. Test Suite Execution: The build process failed to complete successfully due to multiple errors in the runtime compilation (initmod.hvx_128.bc and initmod.x86.bc). The test suite did not execute to completion, which violates Condition 1 of the success criteria.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The core functionality cannot be verified since the build process failed before reaching a state where core modules could be imported or basic API calls could be tested. The runtime compilation errors prevented the system from reaching a functional state, violating Condition 2.

The agent attempted multiple strategies including modifying build configurations, downgrading LLVM versions, and building LLVM from source, but none succeeded in creating a working environment where tests could execute or core functionality could be verified. The timeout during LLVM source compilation was the final failure point.
