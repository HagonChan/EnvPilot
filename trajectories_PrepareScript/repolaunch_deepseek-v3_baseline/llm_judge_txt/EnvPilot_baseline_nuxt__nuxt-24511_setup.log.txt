PASSED

Detailed Reasoning:
1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):
- Multiple test suites executed successfully including test/bundle.test.ts, test/runtime-compiler.test.ts, and test/basic.test.ts
- The test framework generated complete reports showing 163 passed tests out of 186 total tests
- While there were 2 test failures in the HMR suite, this doesn't prevent the overall test suite from completing
- The test execution shows proper test structure with beforeAll/afterAll hooks and detailed reporting

2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):
- The build process completed successfully (pnpm build)
- Core modules were properly imported and executed as evidenced by the successful test cases
- Basic functionality was demonstrated through numerous passing test cases across different modules
- The system successfully installed all required dependencies including Playwright browsers and system libraries

The environment meets both success criteria despite some individual test failures, as the test suites completed execution and core functionality was verified. The two failing HMR tests appear to be edge cases rather than fundamental environment configuration issues.
