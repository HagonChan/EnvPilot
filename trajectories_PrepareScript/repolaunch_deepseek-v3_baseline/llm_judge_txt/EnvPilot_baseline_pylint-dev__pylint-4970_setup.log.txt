PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The output shows that pytest successfully executed the test suite with 1403 tests passing and 60 skipped. The test framework generated a complete report structure, including benchmark results, meeting Condition 1 of the success criteria.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The package was successfully installed in editable mode (pip install -e .) and the tests were able to import and execute core functionality tests. The benchmark tests specifically verify core performance characteristics, demonstrating that main functional modules are working as expected, meeting Condition 2.

The environment configuration is successful as both critical conditions are satisfied: the test suite completed execution and core functionality was verified through extensive test execution. The skipped tests and warnings do not affect the fundamental success criteria as they represent non-critical test cases rather than framework or core functionality failures.
