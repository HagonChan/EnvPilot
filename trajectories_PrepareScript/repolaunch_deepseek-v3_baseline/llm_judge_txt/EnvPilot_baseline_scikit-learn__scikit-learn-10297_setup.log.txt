FAILED

1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The agent was unable to successfully install and configure the scikit-learn package in editable mode, which means no test suite could be executed. The installation process consistently failed with Cython compilation errors, despite attempts to resolve version incompatibilities.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The core scikit-learn package could not be properly installed or imported due to the persistent compilation errors. The agent made multiple attempts with different Python versions and dependency configurations, but none succeeded in establishing basic functionality.

The environment configuration ultimately failed because:
- The package installation never completed successfully
- No test suite could be executed
- Core functionality could not be verified
- The process timed out after multiple unsuccessful attempts
- The fundamental compilation errors prevented any meaningful progress

The agent exhausted its options within the time limit without achieving either of the two required success criteria. The repeated timeouts during package installation attempts further compounded the issues, preventing any successful environment configuration.
