FAILED
1. Test Suite Execution: The agent failed to execute any test suite. The environment setup was interrupted multiple times due to timeout issues during package installation (tzdata configuration) and dependency management (composer and npm installations). No test suite was able to start or complete execution.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The agent could not verify core functionality as it couldn't successfully install the required dependencies (PHP, Composer, Node.js) or project-specific packages. Basic commands like `php -v` and `composer --version` also timed out, indicating fundamental environment setup failures.

The environment configuration failed because:
- No test suite could be executed (Condition 1 not met)
- Core functionality couldn't be verified due to incomplete dependency installation (Condition 2 not met)
- The agent reached the global timeout limit without achieving basic operational status
- Multiple attempts to resolve the tzdata installation issue were unsuccessful
- The system couldn't progress beyond initial package installation steps
