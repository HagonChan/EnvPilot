PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The test suite successfully started, executed, and completed with a full test report structure. While there were some test failures (6 out of 1827), the majority of tests passed (1827 passed) and the test framework generated a complete report. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The agent successfully installed all dependencies including dev extras, and the main functional modules were able to be imported and used. The test execution demonstrates that core functionality is working, despite some test failures related to deprecation warnings. This meets Condition 2 of the success criteria.

The environment configuration is considered successful because:
- The test suite completed execution with a full report
- Core functionality was verified through test execution
- The remaining failures are non-critical (deprecation warnings rather than fundamental breaks)
- The agent achieved basic functionality within the call limit
