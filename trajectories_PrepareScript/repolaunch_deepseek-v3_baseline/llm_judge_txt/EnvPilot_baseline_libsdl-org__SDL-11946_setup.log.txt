PASSED

1. Test Suite Execution:
- The agent successfully executed multiple test suites (23 tests in total) using ctest
- All tests passed with no failures (100% success rate)
- The test framework generated a complete test report structure showing execution times and pass/fail status
- Example test executions: testaudioinfo, testautomation, testatomic, etc. all completed successfully

2. Core Functionality Verification:
- The project built successfully using CMake and make
- Multiple core functional modules were tested and verified (audio, threads, filesystem, platform, etc.)
- The test results demonstrate that basic API calls and core features are working as expected
- The testtimer test ran for 17+ seconds, indicating proper timing functionality
- The testprocess test verified process handling capabilities

The environment configuration meets both success criteria:
1. Multiple complete test suites executed and finished successfully
2. Core functionality was verified through the test executions
3. No critical errors were encountered during the process
4. The agent completed the setup within the call limit
