FAILED
1. Test Suite Execution: The agent failed to execute any test suite successfully. All attempts to run tests (including './runtest', 'make test-unit', and 'make -j4') resulted in timeouts before any test could start or complete. No test report structure was generated.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The agent was unable to verify core functionality. All build and test commands timed out before any meaningful execution could occur. The container environment appears to have fundamental issues preventing any commands from completing.

The environment configuration failed because:
- No test suite could start or complete execution (failing Condition 1)
- Core functionality could not be verified due to persistent timeouts (failing Condition 2)
- The agent exceeded the maximum time limit without achieving basic functionality
- The container environment appears to have unresolvable issues preventing any commands from executing properly
