PASSED

Detailed Reasoning:
1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):
- The vitest test suite successfully executed with 137 test files passing and 682 tests passing
- The test framework generated a complete report showing execution times and status
- While there were initial issues with turbo, running vitest directly worked perfectly

2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):
- The main modules were successfully imported as evidenced by the test execution
- Core functionality was demonstrated through the extensive test suite execution
- The test results show that basic API calls and core features are working as expected

The environment configuration meets both success criteria despite the initial turbo issues, since:
1. The vitest test suite completed successfully with a full report
2. Core functionality was verified through the test execution
3. The agent successfully installed all required dependencies (Node.js, pnpm) and configured the environment properly
