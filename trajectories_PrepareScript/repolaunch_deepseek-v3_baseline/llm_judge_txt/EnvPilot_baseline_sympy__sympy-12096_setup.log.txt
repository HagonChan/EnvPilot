PASSED
Detailed reasoning:
1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1): The test suite completed execution successfully with a comprehensive test report structure. While there were some individual test failures (marked with 'f') and warnings (marked with 'w'), the test framework ran to completion across all test modules, which meets the success criteria.

2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2): The core functionality is working as evidenced by:
   - Successful import and usage of main SymPy modules
   - All example scripts (beginner, intermediate, advanced) passed their tests
   - The test suite was able to execute and validate numerous core features
   - The agent was able to fix Python 3.10 compatibility issues and get the system operational

The environment configuration is successful because:
- The test framework executed completely (despite some individual test failures)
- Core modules can be imported and used
- Example code demonstrates working functionality
- The system is now operational for development and testing purposes
