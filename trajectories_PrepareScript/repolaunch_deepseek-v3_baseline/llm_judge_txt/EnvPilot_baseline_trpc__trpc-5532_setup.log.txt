PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The test suite completed successfully with 602 tests passed and 6 skipped. The output shows the test framework (vitest) generated a complete test report structure with detailed timing and results for each test file. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.

2. Core Functionality Verification: While the logs don't show explicit API usage, the successful execution of 602 tests (including tests for core functionality like server adapters, middleware, and client operations) strongly implies that the core modules can be imported and used normally. The test results demonstrate the fundamental functionality is working, meeting Condition 2.

The environment configuration was successful despite:
- Initial challenges with pnpm installation
- Peer dependency warnings during package installation
- The lengthy dependency installation process

The agent successfully:
1. Installed required tools (Node.js, pnpm)
2. Resolved installation issues
3. Installed project dependencies
4. Executed the test suite to completion
5. Achieved a high test pass rate

This satisfies both success criteria - test suite completion and core functionality verification.
