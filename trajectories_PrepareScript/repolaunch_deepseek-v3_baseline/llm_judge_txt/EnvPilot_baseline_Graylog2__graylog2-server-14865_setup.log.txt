FAILED
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): The test suite did not complete successfully. While tests were executed (3798 tests run), there were 3 failures and 540 errors, primarily related to Docker container fetching issues. The testing framework generated a report, but the high number of errors indicates the test suite did not finish in a fully operational state.

2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): The output does not demonstrate successful verification of core functionality. While the build process completed for some modules, there's no evidence that main functional modules were imported and used normally, or that basic API calls returned expected results. The Docker-related test failures suggest fundamental integration issues that would likely prevent core functionality from working properly.

The environment configuration failed because:
- The test suite did not complete successfully (too many errors)
- Core functionality cannot be verified due to Docker integration failures
- The build ultimately failed with test execution errors
- While some tests passed, the critical mass of failures indicates the environment is not properly configured for operation

The agent made multiple attempts to resolve issues (installing dependencies, skipping tests, etc.) but was unable to achieve a fully functional configuration that meets both success criteria.
