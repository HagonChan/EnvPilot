PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The test suite successfully executed with Node.js 22.18.0, completing 205 tests across 43 suites with only 1 failure (203 passes). The test framework generated a complete report structure including test counts, durations, and failure details. The single failure appears to be test-specific rather than an environment issue.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The core functionality was verified through:
   - Successful build process (npm run build)
   - Multiple test categories passing (unit tests, size checks, formatting checks)
   - Vendor API tests working (YAML parsing, fetch, globby)
   - Package content validation
   - Utility function tests passing

The environment meets both success criteria despite one non-critical test failure, as the test suite completed execution and core functionality was verified. The agent successfully resolved version conflicts by upgrading Node.js to the required version (22.x).
