FAILED

The environment configuration did not meet the success criteria for the following reasons:

1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):
- No test suite was able to start or execute due to the persistent timeout issues during package installation
- The agent was unable to complete the basic PHP and Composer installation required to run tests
- The testing framework (PHPUnit) was never reached or initialized

2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):
- The agent failed to install the minimum required PHP packages
- Composer could not be installed, meaning core dependency management functionality was unavailable
- No core modules could be imported or tested due to the incomplete environment setup

The failure was caused by repeated timeout errors during package installation, which prevented the agent from establishing even the most basic PHP environment. The agent exhausted its maximum call limit (2 hours) without achieving any of the fundamental setup steps required for either test execution or core functionality verification.
