FAILED

1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The agent was unable to successfully install the package or run any test suite. The installation process consistently failed due to version conflicts with setuptools and Python compatibility issues. No test suite was executed.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The agent could not verify any core functionality as the package installation failed completely. The main modules could not be imported or used due to the unresolved installation issues.

The environment configuration failed because:
- The package installation failed repeatedly due to setuptools version conflicts
- Attempts to resolve the conflicts by downgrading setuptools were unsuccessful
- The agent couldn't successfully create a working virtual environment with compatible Python/setuptools versions
- Timeout issues prevented completion of Python 3.8 installation attempts
- No test suite was executed and no core functionality could be verified

The fundamental issue appears to be a deep incompatibility between the package's requirements and the available Python/setuptools versions in the environment. The agent exhausted all reasonable attempts to resolve this without success.
