FAILED
1. Test Suite Execution: The agent failed to execute any test suite. Every attempt to run tests or check PHP/PHPUnit versions resulted in timeouts due to the stuck tzdata configuration. No test suite was able to start, execute, or complete successfully.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The agent was unable to verify core functionality. Basic commands like 'php -v' and 'phpunit --version' timed out, indicating the PHP environment was not properly configured. There's no evidence that core modules could be imported or basic API calls could be made.

The environment configuration failed because:
- The tzdata configuration issue prevented proper system setup
- No test suite could be executed (Condition 1 not met)
- Core PHP functionality couldn't be verified (Condition 2 not met)
- The agent reached the global timeout without achieving basic functionality
