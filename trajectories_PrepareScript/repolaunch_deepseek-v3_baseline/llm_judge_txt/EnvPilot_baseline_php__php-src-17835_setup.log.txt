PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The test suite completed successfully with 14362 tests passing out of 20233 total tests. While 5863 tests were skipped (due to missing extensions), this doesn't constitute a failure as the test framework executed fully and generated a complete test report structure. The output shows multiple test cases executing and completing, meeting the first success criterion.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The PHP build process completed successfully, and the test results demonstrate that core functionality is working. The agent successfully built PHP from source, configured it with debug symbols, and executed the test suite. The high number of passing tests indicates that main functional modules can be imported and used normally, meeting the second success criterion.

The skipped tests were due to optional extensions not being installed, which doesn't affect the core functionality. The timeout at the end was just an interactive prompt and didn't affect the test execution. Both success criteria have been satisfied.
