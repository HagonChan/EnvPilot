PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The agent successfully executed the test suite (`go test ./...`) after upgrading to Go 1.20. The output shows both test packages (`github.com/labstack/echo/v4` and `github.com/labstack/echo/v4/middleware`) completed with "ok" status, indicating the test framework executed normally and generated results.

2. Core Functionality Verification: While not explicitly shown through API calls, the successful test execution implies the core modules could be imported and used normally. The tests wouldn't pass if fundamental imports or functionality were broken. The agent also successfully installed dependencies (`go mod download`) and configured the Go environment properly.

The initial test failures with Go 1.18 were resolved by upgrading to the required version (1.20), demonstrating the agent's ability to diagnose and fix environment configuration issues. The final test execution meets both success criteria.
