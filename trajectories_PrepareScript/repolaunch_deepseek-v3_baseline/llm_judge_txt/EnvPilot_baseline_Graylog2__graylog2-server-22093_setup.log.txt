FAILED
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): The test suite did not complete successfully. While the build eventually succeeded with tests skipped (-DskipTests=true), this was only achieved by bypassing the actual test execution. When attempting to run tests normally, they failed due to missing Docker containers (MongoDB) required for testing. The test framework generated reports but with numerous failures (4897 tests run, 4 failures, 634 errors, 97 skipped).

2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): There is no evidence that core functional modules were imported or used successfully. The output shows compilation steps completing, but no verification of actual functionality through API calls or example code execution. The focus was on build configuration rather than functional verification.

The environment configuration cannot be considered successful because:
- No test suite completed successfully without being skipped
- Core functionality was not demonstrated or verified
- The solution required disabling tests rather than properly configuring the environment to support them
- Docker dependencies were not resolved, preventing proper test execution
