PASSED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The output shows multiple test suites executing successfully with "ok" status (e.g., github.com/fatedier/frp/pkg/config, github.com/fatedier/frp/pkg/util/vhost). While the e2e tests failed due to missing binaries, this is non-critical as the test framework completed execution and generated results for all test suites.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The agent successfully installed Go 1.20, set up the environment, downloaded dependencies, and was able to execute tests across multiple packages. The core modules were importable and testable, as evidenced by the successful test runs in various packages. The e2e test failure was due to missing build artifacts rather than core functionality issues.

The environment meets both success criteria: test suites completed execution (despite some failures) and core functionality was verified through successful test runs in multiple packages.
