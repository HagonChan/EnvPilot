PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The output shows that multiple test suites completed successfully. Specifically, 43 tests passed in the lib.rs test suite, and 13 tests passed in the deploy test suite. While there was one failure in the deploy test suite (deployed_predicate_call), this does not prevent the overall test suite from completing and generating a report structure, meeting Condition 1.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The successful execution of the majority of tests demonstrates that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally. The tests cover various core functionalities including CLI commands, contract operations, and other essential features. The fact that most tests pass indicates that basic API calls return expected results and core features work as demonstrated through the test executions, meeting Condition 2.

The single test failure appears to be a test-specific issue rather than a fundamental environment configuration problem, as the majority of tests pass and the environment supports the execution of the test suite. Therefore, the environment configuration meets the success criteria.
