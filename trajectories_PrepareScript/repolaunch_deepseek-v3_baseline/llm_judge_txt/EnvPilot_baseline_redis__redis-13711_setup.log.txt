FAILED
1. Test Suite Execution: The agent failed to execute any test suite. All attempts to build and test the Redis repository resulted in timeouts (exit code 124). The build process couldn't even start properly due to persistent timezone configuration issues, preventing any test execution.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The agent couldn't verify any core functionality. The environment setup was incomplete as the basic build process (make) couldn't complete, meaning no Redis binaries were produced and no core modules could be imported or tested.

The environment configuration failed because:
- No test suite could start or complete (violates Condition 1)
- No core functionality could be verified (violates Condition 2)
- The agent exceeded the maximum time limit without achieving basic functionality
- All operations resulted in timeouts, indicating fundamental environment setup issues

The repeated timeouts during package installation and build process indicate the environment wasn't properly configured to support the Redis build and test requirements.
