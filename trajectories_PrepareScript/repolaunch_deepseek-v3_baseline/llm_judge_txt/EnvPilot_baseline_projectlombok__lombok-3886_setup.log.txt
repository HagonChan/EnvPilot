FAILED
1. Test Suite Execution: The compilation failed with multiple errors related to the missing PatchScript class, which means no test suite could start or execute successfully. The build process terminated before any tests could run.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The core functionality cannot be verified because the project fails to compile due to fundamental compilation errors (missing PatchScript class). Core modules cannot be imported or used normally when the code doesn't compile.

The environment configuration failed because:
- The critical dependency lombok.patcher (containing PatchScript class) could not be properly resolved
- The compilation errors prevent both test execution and core functionality verification
- The agent exhausted its attempts to fix the dependency issue without success

This meets the failure conditions as:
1. The testing framework cannot start due to compilation failures
2. Core modules cannot be imported due to compilation errors
3. The agent reached the maximum call limit without achieving basic functionality
