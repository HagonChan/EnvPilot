FAILED
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): The test suite did not complete successfully. While the project built successfully with `cargo build`, the test execution (`cargo test`) failed to complete due to persistent timeout issues with the tzdata configuration. No test suite was able to start, execute, and finish successfully, and no test report structure was generated.

2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): While the core Rust toolchain was successfully installed and the project built without errors, we cannot confirm that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally since the test suite never completed. The timeout issues prevented verification of basic API calls or core features through example code execution.

The environment configuration failed because:
- The test suite could not execute to completion due to the tzdata configuration timeout
- Core functionality could not be verified due to the test execution failure
- The agent exceeded the maximum call limit without achieving basic test suite execution
- No test suite completed execution, despite multiple attempts with different configurations

Note: The timeout issues appear to be related to system-level configuration (tzdata) rather than the project's environment setup, but this still prevents the success criteria from being met.
