PASSED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The output shows that the test suite executed successfully with all tests passing (marked with âœ“ symbols). The test command "npm test" ran both JavaScript tests and TypeScript typings tests without errors, generating a complete test report structure.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The successful installation of dependencies via "npm ci" and the passing test suite demonstrate that core modules can be imported and used normally. The test output confirms basic API functionality through the various test cases that were executed.

The environment configuration meets both success criteria:
- The test suite completed execution successfully
- Core functionality was verified through test execution
- Despite some deprecated package warnings and vulnerabilities (which are non-critical for this evaluation), the fundamental requirements for a successful configuration were achieved
