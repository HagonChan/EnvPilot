PASSED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The output shows multiple test suites completing successfully with "ok" status (gorm.io/gorm, gorm.io/gorm/callbacks, etc.). While there were initial setup challenges, the final test execution shows complete test suites running and finishing successfully.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The successful execution of the test suites implies that the core modules can be imported and used normally. The fact that the tests ran to completion without fundamental import errors indicates the core functionality is working as expected.

The agent successfully overcame initial Docker and Go version issues, ultimately achieving both success criteria:
- Multiple test suites completed execution (including unit tests for various packages)
- Core functionality was verified through successful test execution
- The agent properly handled dependency management through go mod tidy
- All test packages reported "ok" status in the final run
