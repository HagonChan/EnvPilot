FAILED

Detailed reasoning:
1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):
- The test suite did start and some tests were executing successfully (54 test suites found, many PASSED results shown)
- However, the test execution was interrupted by a timeout before completion ("Exited due to timeout")
- While many individual tests passed, we cannot confirm the test suite completed fully as required by the success criteria

2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):
- The build process failed multiple times with different errors (JavaScript heap out of memory, strict TypeScript check failures)
- While some core functionality might be working (as evidenced by passing tests), we cannot verify all main functional modules are working normally due to the build failures
- The test timeout prevents us from fully verifying core functionality

Additional considerations:
- The environment setup process encountered multiple issues (memory limits, build failures)
- While the agent made progress and some tests passed, neither success condition was fully met
- The timeout during test execution is particularly problematic as it prevents confirmation of test suite completion

Conclusion:
The environment configuration does not meet both required success criteria, primarily due to the incomplete test execution and build failures. While partial success was achieved, the critical requirements were not fully satisfied.
