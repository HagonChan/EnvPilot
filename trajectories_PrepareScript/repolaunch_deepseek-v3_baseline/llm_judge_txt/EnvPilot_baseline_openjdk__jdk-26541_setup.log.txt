FAILED

The environment configuration did not meet the success criteria for the following reasons:

1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**: 
- No test suite was executed at all during the configuration process
- The build configuration failed repeatedly due to incompatible JDK versions
- The agent was unable to successfully complete the configure step, which is a prerequisite for running any tests

2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**:
- The main functional modules were never verified as the configuration failed before reaching that stage
- Basic API calls were not tested since the environment wasn't properly set up
- No example code execution was demonstrated

Key failure points:
- The agent couldn't obtain a compatible Boot JDK (required version 24-26)
- All attempts to download or install a suitable JDK version failed (404 errors for JDK 24, package not found for JDK 25)
- The configuration script consistently rejected the available JDK versions (17 and 21) as being incompatible
- The agent exhausted its attempts without achieving a working configuration

The environment remains non-functional as the fundamental requirement (having a compatible JDK version) was not satisfied, preventing any further verification of the success criteria.
