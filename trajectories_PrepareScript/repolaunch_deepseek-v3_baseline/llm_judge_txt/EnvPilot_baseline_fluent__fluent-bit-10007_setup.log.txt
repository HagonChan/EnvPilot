PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The agent successfully executed the test suite with all 64 tests passing. The test framework generated a complete report showing 100% of tests passed, meeting the first success criterion of having at least one complete test suite execute successfully.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The agent was able to build the project successfully using CMake, which demonstrates that core modules can be compiled and linked properly. The successful execution of the test suite further confirms that core functionality is working as expected, as the tests would have failed if fundamental components were broken.

The environment configuration meets both success criteria:
- Multiple test suites executed to completion with full reports
- Core system was built successfully and tests verified basic functionality
- No critical errors preventing test execution or core functionality were encountered

The agent properly handled initial build issues (missing test directory) by reconfiguring with test flags and successfully completed all validation steps.
