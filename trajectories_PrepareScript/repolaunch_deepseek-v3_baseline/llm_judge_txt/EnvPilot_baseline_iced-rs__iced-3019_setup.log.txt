FAILED

1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - FAILED
- The output shows that while some test suites were executed (like doc-tests for iced_winit), there were no actual tests run (0 tests executed)
- The main test command `cargo test --verbose --workspace -- --ignored` completed with exit code 0, but this doesn't necessarily mean meaningful tests were executed
- No test report structure is visible in the output

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - PARTIALLY MET
- The environment was successfully configured with Rust and all required dependencies
- The build process completed without errors, suggesting core modules could be compiled
- However, there's no explicit verification that core functionality can be imported and used normally
- No example code execution was demonstrated to verify basic API calls return expected results

The environment configuration process was mostly successful in setting up dependencies, but failed to fully demonstrate both required success criteria:
1. No complete test suite execution with meaningful test results
2. No explicit verification of core functionality through imports and example usage
