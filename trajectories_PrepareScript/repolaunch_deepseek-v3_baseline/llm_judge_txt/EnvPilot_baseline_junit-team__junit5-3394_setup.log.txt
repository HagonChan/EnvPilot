PASSED

1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - MET
- The Gradle test suite successfully executed with 118 tests completed
- A test report was generated (as indicated by the message showing where to find the report)
- While there was 1 test failure and 2 skipped tests, this doesn't prevent the suite from completing
- The test execution took nearly 10 minutes, showing substantial test suite activity

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - MET
- Java and Gradle were successfully installed and verified
- The project's build system (Gradle) was able to initialize and execute
- The test execution demonstrates core functionality is operational
- The agent properly identified and used the project's Gradle wrapper (gradlew) which downloaded the correct Gradle version

The single test failure doesn't constitute an environment configuration failure as per the success criteria, since:
1. The test framework completed execution
2. Core functionality was demonstrated
3. The failure appears to be a test case issue rather than an environment setup problem
