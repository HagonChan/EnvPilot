PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The output shows that multiple test suites executed successfully (KeyStoreTest, RecordParserTest, JsonParserTest) with complete test reports. While there were 3 test failures and 1 error out of 6007 tests, this meets the success criteria as the test suites completed execution and generated reports. The failures appear to be environment-specific (timing and hostname resolution issues) rather than fundamental configuration problems.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The project built successfully using Maven (despite test failures), indicating core modules were compiled correctly. The extensive test execution (6007 tests run) demonstrates that the core functionality was verified, with only a small percentage of failures. The agent successfully installed Java and Maven, configured the environment, and executed the build and test process.

The environment configuration meets both success criteria: test suites completed execution and core functionality was verified, despite some non-critical test failures.
