FAILED
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): Not met - The agent failed to install the necessary PHP packages and dependencies due to persistent timeout issues during the apt-get operations. Without these packages, no test suite could be executed.
2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): Not met - The agent couldn't progress beyond the package installation phase, so there was no opportunity to verify core functionality or module imports. The environment setup was incomplete.

The agent encountered repeated timeout errors during package installation attempts, which prevented it from completing the basic environment setup. Despite trying different approaches (non-interactive mode, smaller batches, mirror changes), the fundamental issue of package installation timeouts wasn't resolved within the 2-hour global timeout limit. Without successful package installation, neither test execution nor core functionality verification was possible.
