PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The output shows that 43 Python tests were executed successfully with all tests passing (100% tests passed). The test suite completed execution and generated a complete test report structure, meeting Condition 1 of the success criteria.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The successful build of the project (after resolving CMake and memory issues) and the passing of all Python tests demonstrate that the core functionality is working. The tests cover various aspects including basic operations, boundary conditions, buffers, and other core features, verifying that main functional modules can be imported and used normally (Condition 2).

The environment configuration was successful despite initial challenges with CMake versions and memory constraints during build. The agent successfully resolved these issues by downgrading CMake, updating pybind11, and reducing build parallelism, ultimately achieving both success criteria.
