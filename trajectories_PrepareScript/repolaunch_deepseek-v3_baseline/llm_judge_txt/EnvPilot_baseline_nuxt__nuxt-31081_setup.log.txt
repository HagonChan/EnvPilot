PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The unit tests (pnpm test:unit) ran successfully with 422 tests passed and 1 skipped/todo test. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully, with the testing framework generating a complete test report structure.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The successful execution of 422 unit tests demonstrates that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally, and basic API calls return expected results. The test output shows various core features being tested and passing, including module compatibility checks, route resolution, app configuration, and component loading.

While there were initial failures with browser-based tests due to missing Playwright dependencies (which couldn't be installed due to network issues), the project's core functionality was verified through the extensive unit test suite that doesn't require browser automation. The agent successfully worked around the network limitations by focusing on the unit tests that could run without the problematic dependencies.
