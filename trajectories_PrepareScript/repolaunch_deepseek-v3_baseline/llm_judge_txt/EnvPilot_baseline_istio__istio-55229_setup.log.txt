FAILED
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): There is no evidence that any test suite was executed successfully. The logs show an exception occurred during setup ("object of type 'NoneType' has no len()"), which likely prevented any test execution from occurring.
2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): There is no indication that core modules were imported or basic API calls were tested. The setup process failed before reaching this stage.
3. The exception during setup suggests fundamental configuration issues that would prevent both test execution and core functionality verification. The agent did not complete its environment configuration task successfully.
