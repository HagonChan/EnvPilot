FAILED
1. Test Suite Execution: The agent failed to complete any test suite execution. The environment setup process repeatedly timed out during package installation (PHP and Composer), preventing the test suite from even starting. The timeout issues persisted despite multiple attempts to resolve them by changing package mirrors and installation approaches.

2. Core Functionality Verification: There is no evidence that core functionality was verified. The agent couldn't progress beyond the initial package installation phase due to persistent timeout issues. No PHP modules were successfully installed, and Composer dependencies were never installed, making it impossible to verify any core functionality.

The environment configuration failed because:
- No test suite could be executed (Condition 1 not met)
- Core functionality couldn't be verified (Condition 2 not met)
- The agent exceeded the maximum time limit without achieving basic functionality
- Fundamental package installation failed repeatedly due to timeout issues
