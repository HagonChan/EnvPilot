PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The test suite completed successfully with 116 passing tests out of 118. While there was 1 failure (TypeScript type conflict) and 1 skipped test, the test framework generated a complete report structure and the majority of tests executed successfully. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The main functional modules were successfully built and imported, as evidenced by the successful execution of the build process and the majority of test cases. Core features were demonstrated through the test execution, meeting Condition 2 of the success criteria.

The single remaining TypeScript type conflict is considered a non-critical error since it doesn't prevent core functionality from working. The agent successfully resolved all critical issues (installing Node.js, npm, dependencies, and netcat) and achieved basic functionality. The test suite completion with mostly passing tests confirms the environment is properly configured.
