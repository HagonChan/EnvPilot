PASSED
1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The output shows that all 18 tests passed successfully ("test result: ok. 18 passed; 0 failed"). The test suite completed execution and generated a complete test report structure, meeting this criterion.

2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The project built successfully ("Finished `dev` profile") and all tests passed, indicating the main functional modules can be imported and used normally. The core functionality was demonstrated through the successful test execution.

The environment configuration was successful as both conditions were met: the test suite completed execution and core functionality was verified. The agent properly installed Rust, built the project, and executed tests without any critical errors.
