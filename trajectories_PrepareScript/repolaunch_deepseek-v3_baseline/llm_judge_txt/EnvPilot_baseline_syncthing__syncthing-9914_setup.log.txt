PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The agent successfully executed multiple test suites (e.g., lib/api, lib/db, lib/model) which completed with "ok" status. While some packages had no test files, the key test suites ran to completion and generated test reports, meeting Condition 1.

2. Core Functionality Verification: After resolving the Go version mismatch and generating required assets, the core functionality was verified through successful test execution across multiple modules. The agent demonstrated the ability to import and test core packages like lib/api, lib/db, and lib/model, meeting Condition 2.

The environment configuration succeeded despite initial challenges with Go version management and asset generation. The agent persisted through these issues to achieve both success criteria, with test suites completing and core functionality verified.
