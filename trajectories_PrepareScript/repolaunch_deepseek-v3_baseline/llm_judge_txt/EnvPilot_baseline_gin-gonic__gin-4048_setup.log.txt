FAILED

Detailed Reasoning:
1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):
- The initial test run (`go test ./...`) showed some test failures but completed execution for several packages
- However, subsequent test attempts all timed out without producing any test output
- No complete test suite execution was achieved after the initial attempt
- The test framework was unable to consistently generate test reports

2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):
- While Go was successfully installed and dependencies were downloaded (`go mod download`)
- The environment couldn't properly execute the test suite due to timeout issues
- Core functionality couldn't be verified as the tests couldn't complete
- The timezone-related test failures suggest missing system dependencies that couldn't be properly installed

The configuration failed because:
- No test suite could consistently complete execution (violates Condition 1)
- Core functionality couldn't be properly verified due to test execution issues (violates Condition 2)
- The environment reached a state where even basic test commands timed out
- The agent exceeded reasonable time limits without achieving stable functionality
