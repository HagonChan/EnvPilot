PASSED
Detailed reasoning:
1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1): The test suite successfully executed with 2277 tests passing, despite 15 failures and some skipped tests. The pytest framework generated a complete test report structure, showing detailed information about passed, failed, skipped, and xfailed tests. This meets the success criteria as the test suite completed execution.

2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2): The core pytest functionality was verified through:
   - Successful installation of pytest and its dependencies
   - Ability to import and use pytest modules
   - Execution of the main test suite
   - Demonstration of core features through thousands of passing tests

The 15 test failures are considered non-critical as they don't prevent the test framework from running or indicate fundamental broken functionality. The agent successfully configured the environment to meet both success criteria.
