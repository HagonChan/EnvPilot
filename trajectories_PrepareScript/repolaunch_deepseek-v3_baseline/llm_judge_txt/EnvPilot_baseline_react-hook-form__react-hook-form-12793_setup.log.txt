PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The agent successfully executed the test suite with all 98 test suites passing (1782 tests passed, 8 snapshots). The testing framework (Jest) generated a complete test report structure showing the progress and final results of all test suites. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The environment was properly configured with Node.js 20.x and pnpm installed. All dependencies were successfully installed, and the test command executed without any framework-level errors. The successful test execution implies that the core functional modules can be imported and used normally, meeting Condition 2 of the success criteria.

The agent successfully completed both required conditions for environment configuration success - test suite execution and core functionality verification. The fact that all test suites passed indicates the environment is fully functional.
