FAILED
1. Test Suite Execution: The agent failed to install any dependencies or set up the environment properly due to persistent timeout issues during package installation. No test suite was executed, and no test report was generated. The system couldn't even complete basic PHP package installation, let alone run any tests.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The environment setup didn't progress far enough to verify any core functionality. The agent couldn't install PHP, Composer, or any other required dependencies, so there was no opportunity to import modules or test API calls. The fundamental package installation failures prevented any meaningful progress toward verifying core functionality.

The environment configuration failed because:
- The system consistently timed out during basic package installation attempts
- No dependencies were successfully installed
- No test suite was executed
- No core functionality could be verified
- The agent reached the global timeout limit without achieving any of the basic setup steps
