PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The output shows that all test suites completed successfully with 8 test files passing and 82 tests passing. The Vitest framework generated a complete test report structure showing the execution time and results for each test file. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.

2. Core Functionality Verification: While the output doesn't explicitly show module imports or API calls, the successful execution of all test suites (including tests for core functionality like createStore, combineReducers, and bindActionCreators) strongly implies that the core modules can be imported and used normally. The tests wouldn't pass if the core functionality was broken. This meets Condition 2 of the success criteria.

The environment configuration was ultimately successful after resolving Node.js version conflicts. The initial test failures were due to an outdated Node.js version, but after upgrading to Node.js 18.x, all tests passed successfully. The warnings about peer dependencies did not prevent the tests from running and passing.
