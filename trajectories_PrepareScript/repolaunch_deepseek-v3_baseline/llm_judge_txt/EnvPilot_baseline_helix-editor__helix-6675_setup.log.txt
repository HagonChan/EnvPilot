FAILED
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): The agent failed to install Rust or any necessary dependencies due to network connectivity issues with Ubuntu repositories. No test suite was executed, and no test report was generated. The attempts to download Rust directly also failed due to missing tools (wget, curl, python3) and network issues.

2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): The agent couldn't verify any core functionality since Rust wasn't installed successfully. The cargo command wasn't found, indicating the environment wasn't properly configured for the project's requirements.

The environment configuration failed because:
- Fundamental tools needed for installation (wget, curl, python3) were missing
- Ubuntu package repositories were inaccessible
- All alternative installation methods failed
- No Rust toolchain was successfully installed
- No tests could be run and no core functionality could be verified
