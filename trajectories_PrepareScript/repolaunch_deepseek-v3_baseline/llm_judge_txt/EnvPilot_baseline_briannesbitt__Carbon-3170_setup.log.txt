FAILED
1. Test Suite Execution: The agent failed to install the necessary PHP packages and dependencies due to consistent timeouts during package installation. Without these packages, no test suite could be executed. The output shows repeated failures when attempting to install PHP, composer, and other required components, with all commands timing out after 20 minutes.

2. Core Functionality Verification: Since the basic PHP environment couldn't be set up (package installation failed), there's no evidence that core modules could be imported or that basic API calls would work. The agent couldn't progress beyond the initial setup phase due to the persistent timeout issues.

The failure appears to be caused by network connectivity problems or container restrictions that prevent package manager operations from completing. Without being able to install the fundamental PHP toolchain, neither test execution nor core functionality verification was possible. All attempts to resolve the package installation issues (including trying different installation approaches and checking network connectivity) failed due to the same timeout problem.
