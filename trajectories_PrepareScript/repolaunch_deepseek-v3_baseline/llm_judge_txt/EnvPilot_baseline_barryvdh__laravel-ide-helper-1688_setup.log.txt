FAILED
1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): The agent failed to successfully install PHP and its dependencies, which are required to run any test suites. The installation process repeatedly timed out during package installation, particularly with tzdata configuration. No test suite was executed or completed.

2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): The agent was unable to install PHP and Composer, which are fundamental requirements for the Laravel package's core functionality. Without these basic components, there's no way to verify if core modules can be imported or if basic API calls work.

The agent exhausted its maximum call limit (2 hours) without achieving either of the success criteria. The repeated timeout errors prevented the environment from being properly configured, making it impossible to verify either test suite execution or core functionality.
