PASSED
1. Test Suite Execution: The output shows that multiple test suites (66 out of 69) executed successfully with 786 tests passing (12 skipped). The testing framework (Jest) generated a complete test report structure with detailed pass/fail/skip counts and execution times. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.

2. Core Functionality Verification: The successful execution of the test suites implies that the core modules could be imported and used normally. The fact that 786 tests passed demonstrates that basic API calls were returning expected results and core features were functioning. The agent also successfully installed all required dependencies (Node.js 22.18.0 and npm packages) which enabled the test execution. This meets Condition 2 of the success criteria.

The environment configuration is considered successful because:
- Multiple test suites completed execution with a high pass rate
- The testing framework generated proper reports
- Core functionality was verified through test execution
- All necessary dependencies were correctly installed
- The agent completed the setup within a reasonable timeframe without hitting call limits
