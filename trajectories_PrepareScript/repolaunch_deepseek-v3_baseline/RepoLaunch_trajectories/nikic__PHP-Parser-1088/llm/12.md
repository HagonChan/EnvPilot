Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

How can the parent of a node be obtained?
-----

The AST does not store parent nodes by default. However, the `ParentConnectingVisitor` can be used to achieve this:

```php
use PhpParser\NodeTraverser;
use PhpParser\NodeVisitor\ParentConnectingVisitor;
use PhpParser\ParserFactory;

$code = '...';

$traverser = new NodeTraverser(new ParentConnectingVisitor);

$parser = (new ParserFactory())->createForHostVersion();
$ast    = $parser->parse($code);
$ast    = $traverser->traverse($ast);
```

After running this visitor, the parent node can be obtained through `$node->getAttribute('parent')`.

How can the next/previous sibling of a node be obtained?
-----

Again, siblings are not stored by default, but the `NodeConnectingVisitor` can be used to store
the previous / next node with a common parent as well:

```php
use PhpParser\NodeTraverser;
use PhpParser\NodeVisitor\NodeConnectingVisitor;
use PhpParser\ParserFactory;

$code = '...';

$traverser = new NodeTraverser(new NodeConnectingVisitor);

$parser = (new ParserFactory())->createForHostVersion();
$ast    = $parser->parse($code);
$ast    = $traverser->traverse($ast);
```

After running this visitor, the parent node can be obtained through `$node->getAttribute('parent')`,
the previous node can be obtained through `$node->getAttribute('previous')`, and the next node can be
obtained through `$node->getAttribute('next')`.

`ParentConnectingVisitor` and `NodeConnectingVisitor` should not be used at the same time. The latter
includes the functionality of the former.


How can I limit the impact of cyclic references in the AST?
-----

NodeConnectingVisitor adds a parent reference, which introduces a cycle. This means that the AST can now only be collected by the cycle garbage collector.
This in turn can lead to performance and/or memory issues. 

To break the cyclic references between AST nodes `NodeConnectingVisitor` supports a boolean `$weakReferences` constructor parameter.
When set to `true`, all attributes added by `NodeConnectingVisitor` will be wrapped into a `WeakReference` object.

After enabling this parameter, the parent node can be obtained through `$node->getAttribute('weak_parent')`,
the previous node can be obtained through `$node->getAttribute('weak_previous')`, and the next node can be
obtained through `$node->getAttribute('weak_next')`.
