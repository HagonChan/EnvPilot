##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

### File:
------ START FILE packaging/common/Description.txt ------
 Halide is a programming language designed to make it easier to write
 high-performance image and array processing code on modern machines. Halide
 currently targets:

 * CPU architectures: X86, ARM, Hexagon, PowerPC, RISC-V, WebAssembly
 * Operating systems: Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Qualcomm QuRT
 * GPU APIs: CUDA, OpenCL, OpenGL Compute Shaders, Apple Metal, Direct X 12

Rather than being a standalone programming language, Halide is embedded in C++.
This means you write C++ code that builds an in-memory representation of a
Halide pipeline using Halide's C++ API. You can then compile this representation
to an object file, or JIT-compile it and run it in the same process.
