##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

### File:
------ START FILE script/docker-entrypoint.sh ------
#!/bin/sh

set -eu

[ -n "${UMASK:-}" ] && umask "$UMASK"

if [ "$(id -u)" = '0' ]; then
  binary="$1"
  if [ -z "${PCAP:-}" ]; then
    # If Syncthing should have no extra capabilities, make sure to remove them
    # from the binary. This will fail with an error if there are no
    # capabilities to remove, hence the || true etc.
    setcap -r "$binary" 2>/dev/null || true
  else
    # Set capabilities on the Syncthing binary before launching it.
    setcap "$PCAP" "$binary"
  fi

  # Chown may fail, which may cause us to be unable to start; but maybe
  # it'll work anyway, so we let the error slide.
  chown "${PUID}:${PGID}" "${HOME}" || true
  exec su-exec "${PUID}:${PGID}" \
       env HOME="$HOME" "$@"
else
  exec "$@"
fi

------ END FILE script/docker-entrypoint.sh ------
