##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to install dependencies and set up a environment that is able to run the tests of the project.

- You start with an initial Docker container based on ubuntu:22.04.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- No need to clone the project again.

The final objective is to successfully run the tests of the project.


### TypeScript-Specific Instructions:
- Use npm, yarn, or pnpm to install dependencies (check package.json and lockfiles)
- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies
- Check package.json for test scripts and build commands
- Consider using `npm ci` for faster, reproducible builds if package-lock.json exists
- Install TypeScript globally if needed (e.g., `npm install -g typescript`)


================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

    Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
        <command>bash command</command>
        e.g. install build-essential: <command>apt-get install -y build-essential</command>
        e.g. view file content: <command>cat README.md</command>
    Search: search the web for if you need some information, generate query and reply with following format:
        <search>the search query</search>
        e.g. <search>how to fix 'No module named setuptools'</search>
        e.g. <search>how to install python3 on ubuntu</search>
        e.g. <search>how to create development environment for python3</search>
    Stop: stop the setup loop once you think the setup is complete, reply with following format:
        <stop></stop>
    

Observation will be the result of running those actions.


Project Structure: the structure of the project, including files and directories.
Related Files: the content of related files of the project that may help you understand the project.
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: <command>your bash command here</command> or <search>your search query</search> or other actions available
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) ...
Thought: I think the setup should be fine
Action: <stop>stop the setup</stop>
Answer: the final result

Lexical is an extensible JavaScript web text-editor framework with an emphasis on reliability, accessibility, and performance. Lexical aims to provide a best-in-class developer experience, so you can easily prototype and build features with confidence. Combined with a highly extensible architecture, Lexical allows developers to create unique text editing experiences that scale in size and functionality.

For documentation and more information about Lexical, be sure to [visit the Lexical website](https://lexical.dev).

Here are some examples of what you can do with Lexical:

## Getting started with React

> Note: Lexical is not only limited to React. Lexical can support any underlying DOM based library once bindings for that library have been created.

Install `lexical` and `@lexical/react`:

```
npm install --save lexical @lexical/react
```

Below is an example of a basic plain text editor using `lexical` and `@lexical/react` ([try it yourself](https://stackblitz.com/github/facebook/lexical/tree/main/examples/react-plain-text?embed=1&file=src%2FApp.tsx&terminalHeight=0&ctl=1&showSidebar=0&devtoolsheight=0&view=preview)).

```jsx
import {$getRoot, $getSelection} from 'lexical';
import {useEffect} from 'react';

import {LexicalComposer} from '@lexical/react/LexicalComposer';
import {PlainTextPlugin} from '@lexical/react/LexicalPlainTextPlugin';
import {ContentEditable} from '@lexical/react/LexicalContentEditable';
import {HistoryPlugin} from '@lexical/react/LexicalHistoryPlugin';
import {OnChangePlugin} from '@lexical/react/LexicalOnChangePlugin';
import {useLexicalComposerContext} from '@lexical/react/LexicalComposerContext';
import {LexicalErrorBoundary} from '@lexical/react/LexicalErrorBoundary';

const theme = {
  // Theme styling goes here
  // ...
}

// When the editor changes, you can get notified via the
// LexicalOnChangePlugin!
function onChange(editorState) {
  editorState.read(() => {
    // Read the contents of the EditorState here.
    const root = $getRoot();
    const selection = $getSelection();

    console.log(root, selection);
  });
}

// Lexical React plugins are React components, which makes them
// highly composable. Furthermore, you can lazy load plugins if
// desired, so you don't pay the cost for plugins until you
// actually use them.
function MyCustomAutoFocusPlugin() {
  const [editor] = useLexicalComposerContext();

  useEffect(() => {
    // Focus the editor when the effect fires!
    editor.focus();

## Lexical is a framework

The core of Lexical is a dependency-free text editor framework that allows developers to build powerful, simple and complex,
editor surfaces. Lexical has a few concepts that are worth exploring:

### Editor instances

Editor instances are the core thing that wires everything together. You can attach a contenteditable DOM element to editor instances, and also
register listeners and commands. Most importantly, the editor allows for updates to its `EditorState`. You can create an editor instance
using the `createEditor()` API, however you normally don't have to worry when using framework bindings such as `@lexical/react` as this
is handled for you.

### Editor States

An Editor State is the underlying data model that represents what you want to show on the DOM. Editor States contain two parts:

- a Lexical node tree
- a Lexical selection object

Editor States are immutable once created, and in order to create one, you must do so via `editor.update(() => {...})`. However, you
can also "hook" into an existing update using node transforms or command handlers – which are invoked as part of an existing update
workflow to prevent cascading/waterfalling of updates. You can retrieve the current editor state using `editor.getEditorState()`.

Editor States are also fully serializable to JSON and can easily be serialized back into the editor using `editor.parseEditorState()`.

### Reading and Updating Editor State

When you want to read and/or update the Lexical node tree, you must do it via `editor.update(() => {...})`. You may also do
read-only operations with the editor state via `editor.read(() => {...})` or `editor.getEditorState().read(() => {...})`.
The closure passed to the update or read call is important, and must be synchronous. It's the only place where you have full
"lexical" context of the active editor state, and providing you with access to the Editor State's node tree. We promote using
the convention of using `$` prefixed functions (such as `$getRoot()`) to convey that these functions must be called in this
context. Attempting to use them outside of a read or update will trigger a runtime error.

For those familiar with React Hooks, you can think of these $functions as having similar functionality:
| *Feature* | React Hooks | Lexical $functions |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Naming Convention | `useFunction` | `$function` |
| Context Required | Can only be called while rendering | Can only be called while in an update or read |
| Can be composed | Hooks can call other hooks | $functions can call other $functions |
| Must be synchronous | ✅ | ✅ |
| Other rules | ❌ Must be called unconditionally in the same order | ✅ None |

Node Transforms and Command Listeners are called with an implicit `editor.update(() => {...})` context.

It is permitted to do nested updates, or nested reads, but an update should not be nested in a read
or vice versa. For example, `editor.update(() => editor.update(() => {...}))` is allowed. It is permitted
to nest nest an `editor.read` at the end of an `editor.update`, but this will immediately flush the update
and any additional update in that callback will throw an error.

All Lexical Nodes are dependent on the associated Editor State. With few exceptions, you should only call methods
and access properties of a Lexical Node while in a read or update call (just like `$` functions). Methods
on Lexical Nodes will first attempt to locate the latest (and possibly a writable) version of the node from the
active editor state using the node's unique key. All versions of a logical node have the same key. These keys
are managed by the Editor, are only present at runtime (not serialized), and should be considered to be random and
opaque (do not write tests that assume hard-coded values for keys).

This is done because the editor state's node tree is recursively frozen after reconciliation to
support efficient time travel (undo/redo and similar use cases). Methods that update nodes
first call `node.getWritable()`, which will create a writable clone of a frozen node. This would normally
mean that any existing references (such as local variables) would refer to a stale version of the node, but
having Lexical Nodes always refer to the editor state allows for a simpler and less error-prone data model.

:::tip

If you use `editor.read(() => { /* callback */ })` it will first flush any pending updates, so you will
always see a consistent state. When you are in an `editor.update`, you will always be working with the
pending state, where node transforms and DOM reconciliation may not have run yet.
`editor.getEditorState().read()` will use the latest reconciled `EditorState` (after any node transforms,
DOM reconciliation, etc. have already run), any pending `editor.update` mutations will not yet be visible.

:::

### DOM Reconciler

Lexical has its own DOM reconciler that takes a set of Editor States (always the "current" and the "pending") and applies a "diff"
on them. It then uses this diff to update only the parts of the DOM that need changing. You can think of this as a kind-of virtual DOM,
except Lexical is able to skip doing much of the diffing work, as it knows what was mutated in a given update. The DOM reconciler
adopts performance optimizations that benefit the typical heuristics of a content editable – and is able to ensure consistency for
LTR and RTL languages automatically.

### Listeners, Node Transforms and Commands

Outside of invoking updates, the bulk of work done with Lexical is via listeners, node transforms and commands. These all stem from
the editor and are prefixed with `register`. Another important feature is that all the register methods return a function to easily unsubscribe them. For example here is how you listen to an update to a Lexical editor:

```js
const unregisterListener = editor.registerUpdateListener(({editorState}) => {
  // An update has occurred!
  console.log(editorState);
});

// Ensure we remove the listener later!
unregisterListener();
```

Commands are the communication system used to wire everything together in Lexical. Custom commands can be created using `createCommand()` and
dispatched to an editor using `editor.dispatchCommand(command, payload)`. Lexical dispatches commands internally when key presses are triggered
and when other important signals occur. Commands can also be handled using `editor.registerCommand(handler, priority)`, and incoming commands are
propagated through all handlers by priority until a handler stops the propagation (in a similar way to event propagation in the browser).

## Working with Lexical

This section covers how to use Lexical, independently of any framework or library. For those intending to use Lexical in their React applications,
it's advisable to [check out the source-code for the hooks that are shipped in `@lexical/react`](https://github.com/facebook/lexical/tree/main/packages/lexical-react/src).

### Creating an editor and using it

When you work with Lexical, you normally work with a single editor instance. An editor instance can be thought of as the one responsible
for wiring up an EditorState with the DOM. The editor is also the place where you can register custom nodes, add listeners, and transforms.

An editor instance can be created from the `lexical` package and accepts an optional configuration object that allows for theming and other options:

```js
import {createEditor} from 'lexical';

const config = {
  namespace: 'MyEditor',
  theme: {
    ...
  },
};

const editor = createEditor(config);
```

Once you have an editor instance, when ready, you can associate the editor instance with a content editable `<div>` element in your document:

```js
const contentEditableElement = document.getElementById('editor');

editor.setRootElement(contentEditableElement);
```

If you want to clear the editor instance from the element, you can pass `null`. Alternatively, you can switch to another element if need be,
just pass an alternative element reference to `setRootElement()`.

### Working with Editor States

With Lexical, the source of truth is not the DOM, but rather an underlying state model
that Lexical maintains and associates with an editor instance. You can get the latest
editor state from an editor by calling `editor.getEditorState()`.

Editor states are serializable to JSON, and the editor instance provides a useful method
to deserialize stringified editor states.

```js
const stringifiedEditorState = JSON.stringify(editor.getEditorState().toJSON());

const newEditorState = editor.parseEditorState(stringifiedEditorState);
```

### Updating an editor

There are a few ways to update an editor instance:

- Trigger an update with `editor.update()`
- Setting the editor state via `editor.setEditorState()`
- Applying a change as part of an existing update via `editor.registerNodeTransform()`
- Using a command listener with `editor.registerCommand(EXAMPLE_COMMAND, () => {...}, priority)`

The most common way to update the editor is to use `editor.update()`. Calling this function
requires a function to be passed in that will provide access to mutate the underlying
editor state. When starting a fresh update, the current editor state is cloned and
used as the starting point. From a technical perspective, this means that Lexical leverages a technique
called double-buffering during updates. There's an editor state to represent what is current on
the screen, and another work-in-progress editor state that represents future changes.

Reconciling an update is typically an async process that allows Lexical to batch multiple synchronous
updates of the editor state together in a single update to the DOM – improving performance. When
Lexical is ready to commit the update to the DOM, the underlying mutations and changes in the update
batch will form a new immutable editor state. Calling `editor.getEditorState()` will then return the
latest editor state based on the changes from the update.

Here's an example of how you can update an editor instance:

```js
import {$getRoot, $getSelection, $createParagraphNode} from 'lexical';

// Inside the `editor.update` you can use special $ prefixed helper functions.
// These functions cannot be used outside the closure, and will error if you try.
// (If you're familiar with React, you can imagine these to be a bit like using a hook
// outside of a React function component).
editor.update(() => {
  // Get the RootNode from the EditorState
  const root = $getRoot();

  // Get the selection from the EditorState
  const selection = $getSelection();

  // Create a new ParagraphNode
  const paragraphNode = $createParagraphNode();

  // Create a new TextNode
  const textNode = $createTextNode('Hello world');

  // Append the text node to the paragraph
  paragraphNode.append(textNode);

  // Finally, append the paragraph to the root
  root.append(paragraphNode);
});
```

If you want to know when the editor updates so you can react to the changes, you can add an update
listener to the editor, as shown below:

```js
editor.registerUpdateListener(({editorState}) => {
  // The latest EditorState can be found as `editorState`.
  // To read the contents of the EditorState, use the following API:

  editorState.r

Thought: Now that I have the list of test files, I can try running a smaller subset of tests to avoid timeout issues. I'll pick the first test file from the list to run individually.

Action: <command>npm run test-unit -- packages/lexical-selection/src/__tests__/unit/LexicalSelection.test.tsx</command>
