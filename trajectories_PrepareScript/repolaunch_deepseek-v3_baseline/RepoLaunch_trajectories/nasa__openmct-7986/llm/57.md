##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to install dependencies and set up a environment that is able to run the tests of the project.

- You start with an initial Docker container based on ubuntu:22.04.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- No need to clone the project again.

The final objective is to successfully run the tests of the project.


### JavaScript/Node.js-Specific Instructions:
- Use npm, yarn, or pnpm to install dependencies (check package.json and lockfiles)
- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies
- Check package.json for test scripts and build commands
- Consider using `npm ci` for faster, reproducible builds if package-lock.json exists
- Install global dependencies if needed (e.g., `npm install -g typescript`)


================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

    Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
        <command>bash command</command>
        e.g. install build-essential: <command>apt-get install -y build-essential</command>
        e.g. view file content: <command>cat README.md</command>
    Search: search the web for if you need some information, generate query and reply with following format:
        <search>the search query</search>
        e.g. <search>how to fix 'No module named setuptools'</search>
        e.g. <search>how to install python3 on ubuntu</search>
        e.g. <search>how to create development environment for python3</search>
    Stop: stop the setup loop once you think the setup is complete, reply with following format:
        <stop></stop>
    

Observation will be the result of running those actions.


Project Structure: the structure of the project, including files and directories.
Related Files: the content of related files of the project that may help you understand the project.
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: <command>your bash command here</command> or <search>your search query</search> or other actions available
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) ...
Thought: I think the setup should be fine
Action: <stop>stop the setup</stop>
Answer: the final result

Begin!

# Developing Applications With Open MCT

## Scope and purpose of this document

This document is intended to serve as a reference for developing an application
based on Open MCT. It will provide details of the API functions necessary to
extend the Open MCT platform meet common use cases such as integrating with a telemetry source.

The best place to start is with the [Open MCT Tutorials](https://github.com/nasa/openmct-tutorial).
These will walk you through the process of getting up and running with Open
MCT, as well as addressing some common developer use cases.

## Building From Source

The latest version of Open MCT is available from [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/nasa/openmct).
If you have `git`, and `node` installed, you can build Open MCT with the commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nasa/openmct.git
cd openmct
npm install
```

These commands will fetch the Open MCT source from our GitHub repository, and
build a minified version that can be included in your application. The output
of the build process is placed in a `dist` folder under the openmct source
directory, which can be copied out to another location as needed. The contents
of this folder will include a minified javascript file named `openmct.js` as
well as assets such as html, css, and images necessary for the UI.

## Starting an Open MCT application

> [!WARNING]
> Open MCT provides a development server via `webpack-dev-server` (`npm start`). **This should be used for development purposes only and should never be deployed to a production environment**.

To start a minimally functional Open MCT application, it is necessary to
include the Open MCT distributable, enable some basic plugins, and bootstrap
the application. The tutorials walk through the process of getting Open MCT up
and running from scratch, but provided below is a minimal HTML template that
includes Open MCT, installs some basic plugins, and bootstraps the application.
It assumes that Open MCT is installed under an `openmct` subdirectory, as
described in [Building From Source](#building-from-source).

This approach includes openmct using a simple script tag, resulting in a global
variable named `openmct`. This `openmct` object is used subsequently to make
API calls.

Open MCT is packaged as a UMD (Universal Module Definition) module, so common
script loaders are also supported.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Open MCT</title>
    <script src="dist/openmct.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
        openmct.install(openmct.plugins.LocalStorage());
        openmct.install(openmct.plugins.MyItems());
        openmct.install(openmct.plugins.UTCTimeSystem());
        openmct.start();
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

The Open MCT library included above requires certain assets such as html
templates, images, and css. If you installed Open MCT from GitHub as described
in the section on [Building from Source](#building-from-source) then these
assets will have been downloaded along with the Open MCT javascript library.

There are some plugins bundled with the application that provide UI,
persistence, and other default configuration which are necessary to be able to
do anything with the application initially. Any of these plugins can, in
principle, be replaced with a custom plugin. The included plugins are
documented in the [Included Plugins](#included-plugins) section.  

## Types

The Open MCT library includes its own TypeScript declaration files which can be
used to provide code hints and typechecking in your own Open MCT application.

Open MCT's type declarations are generated via `tsc` from JSDoc-style comment
blocks. For more information on this, [check out TypeScript's documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/dts-from-js.html).

### Using Types

In order to use Open MCT's provided types in your own application, create a
`jsconfig.js` at the root of your project with this minimal configuration:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "./",
      "target": "es6",
      "checkJs": true,
      "moduleResolution": "node",
      "paths": {
        "openmct": ["node_modules/openmct/dist/openmct.d.ts"]
      }
  }
}
```

Then, simply import and use `openmct` in your application:

```js
import openmct from "openmct";
```

### Limitations

The effort to add types for Open MCT's public API is ongoing, and the provided
type declarations may be incomplete.

If you would like to contribute types to Open MCT, please check out
[TypeScript's documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/dts-from-js.html) on generating type declarations from JSDoc-style comment blocks.
Then read through our [contributing guide](https://github.com/nasa/openmct/blob/f7cf3f72c2efd46da7ce5719c5e52c8806d166f0/CONTRIBUTING.md) and open a PR!

## Plugins

### Defining and Installing a New Plugin

```javascript
openmct.install(function install(openmctAPI) {
    // Do things here
    // ...
});
```

New plugins are installed in Open MCT by calling `openmct.install`, and
providing a plugin installation function. This function will be invoked on
application startup with one parameter - the openmct API object. A common
approach used in the Open MCT codebase is to define a plugin as a function that
returns this installation function. This allows configuration to be specified
when the plugin is included.

eg.

```javascript
openmct.install(openmct.plugins.Elasticsearch("http://localhost:8002/openmct"));
```

This approach can be seen in all of the [plugins provided with Open MCT](https://github.com/nasa/openmct/blob/master/src/plugins/plugins.js).

## Domain Objects and Identifiers

_Domain Objects_ are the basic entities that represent domain knowledge in Open
MCT.  The temperature sensor on a solar panel, an overlay plot comparing the
results of all temperature sensors, the command dictionary for a spacecraft,
the individual commands in that dictionary, the "My Items" folder: All of these
things are domain objects.

A _Domain Object_ is simply a javascript object with some standard attributes.  
An example of a _Domain Object_ is the "My Items" object which is a folder in
which a user can persist any objects that they create. The My Items object
looks like this:

```javascript
{
    identifier: {
        namespace: ""
        key: "mine"
    }
    name:"My Items",
    type:"folder",
    location:"ROOT",
    composition: []
}
```

### Object Attributes

The main attributes to note are the `identifier`, and `type` attributes.

- `identifier`: A composite key that provides a universally unique identifier
  for this object. The `namespace` and `key` are used to identify the object.
  The `key` must be unique within the namespace.
- `type`: All objects in Open MCT have a type. Types allow you to form an
  ontology of knowledge and provide an abstraction for grouping, visualizing,
  and interpreting data. Details on how to define a new object type are
  provided below.

Open MCT uses a number of builtin types. Typically you are going to want to
define your own when extending Open MCT.

### Domain Object Types

Custom types may be registered via the `addType` function on the Open MCT Type
registry.

eg.

```javascript
openmct.types.addType('example.my-type', {
    name: "My Type",
    description: "This is a type that I added!",
    creatable: true
});
```

The `addType` function accepts two arguments:

- A `string` key identifying the type. This key is used when specifying a type
for an object.  We recommend prefixing your types with a namespace to avoid
conflicts with other plugins.
- An object type specification. An object type definition supports the following
attributes
  - `name`: a `string` naming this object type
  - `description`: a `string` specifying a longer-form description of this type
  - `initialize`: a `function` which initializes the model for new domain objects
    of this type. This can be used for setting default values on an object when
    it is instantiated.
  - `creatable`: A `boolean` indicating whether users should be allowed to create
    this type (default: `false`). This will determine whether the type appears
    in the `Create` menu.
  - `cssClass`: A `string` specifying a CSS class to apply to each representation
    of this object. This is used for specifying an icon to appear next to each
    object of this type.

The [Open MCT Tutorials](https://github.com/nasa/openmct-tutorial) provide a
step-by-step examples of writing code for Open MCT that includes a [section on
defining a new object type](https://github.com/nasa/openmct-tutorial#step-3---providing-objects).

## Root Objects

In many cases, you'd like a certain object (or a certain hierarchy of objects)
to be accessible from the top level of the application (the tree on the left-hand
side of Open MCT.) For example, it is typical to expose a telemetry dictionary
as a hierarchy of telemetry-providing domain objects in this fashion.

To do so, use the `addRoot` method of the object API.

eg.

```javascript
openmct.objects.addRoot({
    namespace: "example.namespace",
    key: "my-key"
},
openmct.priority.HIGH);
```

The `addRoot` function takes a two arguments, the first can be an [object identifier](#domain-objects-and-identifiers) for a root level object, or an array of identifiers for root
level objects, or a function that returns a promise for an identifier or an array of root level objects, the second is a [priority](#priority-api) or numeric value.

When using the `getAll` method of the object API, they will be returned in order of priority.

eg.

```javascript
openmct.objects.addRoot(identifier, openmct.priority.LOW); // low = -1000, will appear last in composition or tree
openmct.objects.addRoot(otherIdentifier, openmct.priority.HIGH); // high = 1000, will appear first in composition or tree
```

Root objects are loaded just like any other objects, i.e. via an object provider.

## Object Providers

An Object Provider is used to build _Domain Objects_, typically retrieved from
some source such as a persistence store or telemetry dictionary. In order to
integrate telemetry from a new source an object provider will need to be created
that can build objects representing telemetry points exposed by the telemetry
source. The API call to define a new object provider is fairly straightforward.
Here's a very simple example:

```javascript
openmct.objects.addProvider('example.namespace', {
    get: function (identifier) {
        return Promise.resolve({
            identifier: identifier,
            name: 'Example Object',
            type: 'example-object-type'
        });
    }
});
```

The `addProvider` function takes two arguments:

- `namespace`: A `string` representing the namespace that this object provider
will provide objects for.
- `provider`: An `object` with a single function, `get`. This function accepts an
[Identifier](#domain-objects-and-identifiers) for the object to be provided.
It is expected that the `get` function will return a
[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
that resolves with the object being requested.

In future, object providers will support other methods to enable other operations with persistence stores, such as creating, updating, and deleting objects.

## Composition Providers

The _composition_ of a domain object is the list of objects it contains, as
shown (for example) in the tree for browsing. Open MCT provides a
[default solution](#default-composition-provider) for composition, but there
may be cases where you want to provide the composition of a certain object
(or type of object) dynamically.

### Adding Composition Providers

You may want to populate a hierarchy under a custom root-level object based on
the contents of a telemetry dictionary. To do this, you can add a new
Composition Provider:

```javascript
openmct.composition.addProvider({
    appliesTo: function (domainObject) {
        return domainObject.type === 'example.my-type';
    },
    load: function (domainObject) {
        return Promise.resolve(myDomainObjects);
    }
});
```

The `addProvider` function accepts a Composition Provider object as its sole
argument. A Composition Provider is a javascript object exposing two functions:

- `appliesTo`: A `function` that accepts a `domainObject` argument, and returns
a `boolean` value indicating whether this composition provider applies to the
given object.
- `load`: A `function` that accepts a `domainObject` as an argument, and returns
a `Promise` that resolves with an array of [Identifier](#domain-objects-and-identifiers).
These identifiers will be used to fetch Domain Objects from an [Object Provider](#object-provider)

### Default Composition Provider

The default composition provider applies to any domain object with a
`composition` property. The value of `composition` should be an array of
identifiers, e.g.:

```javascript
var domainObject = {
    name: "My Object",
    type: 'folder',
    composition: [
        {
            id: '412229c3-922c-444b-8624-736d85516247',
            namespace: 'foo'
        },
        {
            key: 'd6e0ce02-5b85-4e55-8006-a8a505b64c75',
            namespace: 'foo'
        }
    ]
};
```

## Telemetry API

The Open MCT telemetry API provides two main sets of interfaces-- one for
integrating telemetry data into Open MCT, and another for developing Open MCT
visualization plugins utilizing the telemetry API.  

The APIs for visualization plugins are still a work in progress and docs may
change at any time.  However, the APIs for integrating telemetry metadata into
Open MCT are stable and documentation is included below.

### Integrating Telemetry Sources

There are two main tasks for integrating telemetry sources-- describing telemetry objects with relevant metadata, and then providing telemetry data for those objects.  You'll use an [Object Provider](#object-providers) to provide objects with the necessary [Telemetry Metadata](#telemetry-metadata), and then register a [Telemetry Provider](#telemetry-providers) to retrieve telemetry data for those objects.  Alternatively, you can register a telemetry metadata provider to provide the necessary telemetry metadata.

For a step-by-step guide to building a telemetry adapter, please see the
[Open MCT Tutorials](https://github.com/nasa/openmct-tutorial).

#### Telemetry Metadata

A telemetry object is a domain object with a telemetry property.  To take an example from the tutorial, here is the telemetry object for the "fuel" measurement of the spacecraft:

```json
{
    "identifier": {
        "namespace": "example.taxonomy",
        "key": "prop.fuel"
    },
    "name": "Fuel",
    "type": "example.telemetry",
    "telemetry": {
        "values": [
            {
                "key": "value",
                "name": "Value",
                "unit": "kilograms",
                "format": "float",
                "min": 0,
                "max": 100,
                "hints": {
                    "range": 1
                }
            },
            {
                "key": "utc",
                "source": "timestamp",
                "name": "Timestamp",
                "format": "utc",
                "hints": {
                    "domain": 1
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

##### LLM OUTPUT #####
================================== Ai Message ==================================
