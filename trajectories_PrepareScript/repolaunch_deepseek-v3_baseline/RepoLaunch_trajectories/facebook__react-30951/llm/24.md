##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to install dependencies and set up a environment that is able to run the tests of the project.

- You start with an initial Docker container based on ubuntu:22.04.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- No need to clone the project again.

The final objective is to successfully run the tests of the project.


### JavaScript/Node.js-Specific Instructions:
- Use npm, yarn, or pnpm to install dependencies (check package.json and lockfiles)
- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies
- Check package.json for test scripts and build commands
- Consider using `npm ci` for faster, reproducible builds if package-lock.json exists
- Install global dependencies if needed (e.g., `npm install -g typescript`)


================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

    Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
        <command>bash command</command>
        e.g. install build-essential: <command>apt-get install -y build-essential</command>
        e.g. view file content: <command>cat README.md</command>
    Search: search the web for if you need some information, generate query and reply with following format:
        <search>the search query</search>
        e.g. <search>how to fix 'No module named setuptools'</search>
        e.g. <search>how to install python3 on ubuntu</search>
        e.g. <search>how to create development environment for python3</search>
    Stop: stop the setup loop once you think the setup is complete, reply with following format:
        <stop></stop>
    

Observation will be the result of running those actions.


Project Structure: the structure of the project, including files and directories.
Related Files: the content of related files of the project that may help you understand the project.
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: <command>your bash command here</command> or <search>your search query</search> or other actions available
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) ...
Thought: I think the setup should be fine
Action: <stop>stop the setup</stop>
Answer: the final result

Begin!

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

* **Declarative:** React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
* **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.
* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

[Learn how to use React in your project](https://react.dev/learn).

## Installation

React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and **you can use as little or as much React as you need**:

* Use [Quick Start](https://react.dev/learn) to get a taste of React.
* [Add React to an Existing Project](https://react.dev/learn/add-react-to-an-existing-project) to use as little or as much React as you need.
* [Create a New React App](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.

## Documentation

You can find the React documentation [on the website](https://react.dev/).

Check out the [Getting Started](https://react.dev/learn) page for a quick overview.

The documentation is divided into several sections:

* [Quick Start](https://react.dev/learn)
* [Tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)
* [Thinking in React](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react)
* [Installation](https://react.dev/learn/installation)
* [Describing the UI](https://react.dev/learn/describing-the-ui)
* [Adding Interactivity](https://react.dev/learn/adding-interactivity)
* [Managing State](https://react.dev/learn/managing-state)
* [Advanced Guides](https://react.dev/learn/escape-hatches)
* [API Reference](https://react.dev/reference/react)
* [Where to Get Support](https://react.dev/community)
* [Contributing Guide](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html)

You can improve it by sending pull requests to [this repository](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev).

## Examples

We have several examples [on the website](https://react.dev/). Here is the first one to get you started:

```jsx
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

function HelloMessage({ name }) {
  return <div>Hello {name}</div>;
}

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('container'));
root.render(<HelloMessage name="Taylor" />);
```

This example will render "Hello Taylor" into a container on the page.

You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; [we call it JSX](https://react.dev/learn#writing-markup-with-jsx). JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML.

## Contributing

The main purpose of this repository is to continue evolving React core, making it faster and easier to use. Development of React happens in the open on GitHub, and we are grateful to the community for contributing bugfixes and improvements. Read below to learn how you can take part in improving React.

Thought: Now that curl is installed, I can proceed with installing nvm and then Node.js version 18.20.1 as specified in the .nvmrc file.

Action: <command>curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.5/install.sh | bash && source ~/.bashrc && nvm install 18.20.1</command>
