##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

### File:
------ START FILE CHANGELOG-canary.md ------
## March 22, 2024 (18.3.0-canary-670811593-20240322)

## React
- Added `useActionState` to replace `useFormState` and added `pending` value ([#28491](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/28491)).

## October 5, 2023 (18.3.0-canary-546178f91-20231005)

### React

- Added support for async functions to be passed to `startTransition`. 
- `useTransition` now triggers the nearest error boundary instead of a global error.
- Added `useOptimistic`, a new Hook for handling optimistic UI updates. It optimistically updates the UI before receiving confirmation from a server or external source.

### React DOM

- Added support for passing async functions to the `action` prop on `<form>`. When the function passed to `action` is marked with [`'use server'`](https://react.dev/reference/react/use-server), the form is [progressively enhanced](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement).
- Added `useFormStatus`, a new Hook for checking the submission state of a form.
- Added `useFormState`, a new Hook for updating state upon form submission. When the function passed to `useFormState` is marked with [`'use server'`](https://react.dev/reference/react/use-server), the update is [progressively enhanced](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement).
