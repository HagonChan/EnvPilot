##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to install dependencies and set up a environment that is able to run the tests of the project.

- You start with an initial Docker container based on ubuntu:22.04.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- No need to clone the project again.

The final objective is to successfully run the tests of the project.


### Rust-Specific Instructions:
- Use `cargo build` to build the project
- Use `cargo test` to run tests
- Use `cargo check` for faster compilation checks
- Install system dependencies if needed (check Cargo.toml for sys crates)
- Consider using `cargo install` for binary dependencies


================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

    Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
        <command>bash command</command>
        e.g. install build-essential: <command>apt-get install -y build-essential</command>
        e.g. view file content: <command>cat README.md</command>
    Search: search the web for if you need some information, generate query and reply with following format:
        <search>the search query</search>
        e.g. <search>how to fix 'No module named setuptools'</search>
        e.g. <search>how to install python3 on ubuntu</search>
        e.g. <search>how to create development environment for python3</search>
    Stop: stop the setup loop once you think the setup is complete, reply with following format:
        <stop></stop>
    

Observation will be the result of running those actions.


Project Structure: the structure of the project, including files and directories.
Related Files: the content of related files of the project that may help you understand the project.
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: <command>your bash command here</command> or <search>your search query</search> or other actions available
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) ...
Thought: I think the setup should be fine
Action: <stop>stop the setup</stop>
Answer: the final result

<!--toc:end-->

To install Helix, follow the instructions specific to your operating system.
Note that:

- To get the latest nightly version of Helix, you need to
  [build from source](#building-from-source).

- To take full advantage of Helix, install the language servers for your
  preferred programming languages. See the
  [wiki](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/How-to-install-the-default-language-servers)
  for instructions.

## Pre-built binaries

Download pre-built binaries from the
[GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/releases). Add the binary to your system's `$PATH` to use it from the command
line.

## Linux, macOS, Windows and OpenBSD packaging status

Helix is available for Linux, macOS and Windows via the official repositories listed below.

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/helix.svg)](https://repology.org/project/helix/versions)

## Linux

The following third party repositories are available:

### Ubuntu

Helix is available via [Maveonair's PPA](https://launchpad.net/~maveonair/+archive/ubuntu/helix-editor):

```sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:maveonair/helix-editor
sudo apt update
sudo apt install helix
```

### Fedora/RHEL

Helix is available via `copr`:

```sh
sudo dnf copr enable varlad/helix
sudo dnf install helix
```

### Arch Linux community

Releases are available in the `community` repository:

```sh
sudo pacman -S helix
```
Additionally, a [helix-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/helix-git/) package is available
in the AUR, which builds the master branch.

### NixOS

Helix is available as a [flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) in the project
root. Use `nix develop` to spin up a reproducible development shell. Outputs are
cached for each push to master using [Cachix](https://www.cachix.org/). The
flake is configured to automatically make use of this cache assuming the user
accepts the new settings on first use.

If you are using a version of Nix without flakes enabled,
[install Cachix CLI](https://docs.cachix.org/installation) and use
`cachix use helix` to configure Nix to use cached outputs when possible.

### AppImage

Install Helix using [AppImage](https://appimage.org/).
Download Helix AppImage from the [latest releases](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/releases/latest) page.

```sh
chmod +x helix-*.AppImage # change permission for executable mode
./helix-*.AppImage # run helix
```
 
## macOS

### Homebrew Core

```sh
brew install helix
```

## Windows

Install on Windows using [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/), [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)
or [MSYS2](https://msys2.org/).

### Scoop

```sh
scoop install helix
```

### Chocolatey

```sh
choco install helix
```

### MSYS2

For 64-bit Windows 8.1 or above:

```sh
pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-helix
```

## Building from source

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/helix-editor/helix
cd helix
```

Compile from source:

```sh
cargo install --path helix-term --locked
```

This command will create the `hx` executable and construct the tree-sitter
grammars in the local `runtime` folder. To build the tree-sitter grammars requires
a c++ compiler to be installed, for example `gcc-c++`.

> 💡 If you are using the musl-libc instead of glibc the following environment variable must be set during the build
> to ensure tree-sitter grammars can be loaded correctly:
>
> ```sh
> RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=-crt-static"
> ```

> 💡 Tree-sitter grammars can be fetched and compiled if not pre-packaged. Fetch
> grammars with `hx --grammar fetch` (requires `git`) and compile them with
> `hx --grammar build` (requires a C++ compiler). This will install them in
> the `runtime` directory within the user's helix config directory (more
> [details below](#multiple-runtime-directories)).

### Configuring Helix's runtime files

#### Linux and macOS

Either set the `HELIX_RUNTIME` environment variable to point to the runtime files and add it to your `~/.bashrc` or equivalent:

```sh
HELIX_RUNTIME=/home/user-name/src/helix/runtime
```

Or, create a symlink in `~/.config/helix` that links to the source code directory:

```sh
ln -s $PWD/runtime ~/.config/helix/runtime
```

#### Windows

Either set the `HELIX_RUNTIME` environment variable to point to the runtime files using the Windows setting (search for
`Edit environment variables for your account`) or use the `setx` command in
Cmd:

```sh
setx HELIX_RUNTIME "%userprofile%\source\repos\helix\runtime"
```

> 💡 `%userprofile%` resolves to your user directory like
> `C:\Users\Your-Name\` for example.

Or, create a symlink in `%appdata%\helix\` that links to the source code directory:

| Method     | Command                                                                                |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PowerShell | `New-Item -ItemType Junction -Target "runtime" -Path "$Env:AppData\helix\runtime"`     |
| Cmd        | `cd %appdata%\helix` <br/> `mklink /D runtime "%userprofile%\src\helix\runtime"`       |

> 💡 On Windows, creating a symbolic link may require running PowerShell or
> Cmd as an administrator.

#### Multiple runtime directories

When Helix finds multiple runtime directories it will search through them for files in the
following order:

1. `runtime/` sibling directory to `$CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` directory (this is intended for
  developing and testing helix only).
2. `runtime/` subdirectory of OS-dependent helix user config directory.
3. `$HELIX_RUNTIME`.
4. `runtime/` subdirectory of path to Helix executable.

This order also sets the priority for selecting which file will be used if multiple runtime
directories have files with the same name.

### Validating the installation

To make sure everything is set up as expected you should run the Helix health
check:

```sh
hx --health
```

For more information on the health check results refer to
[Health check](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/Healthcheck).

### Configure the desktop shortcut

If your desktop environment supports the
[XDG desktop menu](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/menu-spec-latest.html)
you can configure Helix to show up in the application menu by copying the
provided `.desktop` and icon files to their correct folders:

```sh
cp contrib/Helix.desktop ~/.local/share/applications
cp contrib/helix.png ~/.icons # or ~/.local/share/icons
```

To use another terminal than the system default, you can modify the `.desktop`
file. For example, to use `kitty`:

```sh
sed -i "s|Exec=hx %F|Exec=kitty hx %F|g" ~/.local/share/applications/Helix.desktop
sed -i "s|Terminal=true|Terminal=false|g" ~/.local/share/applications/Helix.desktop
```

# Contributing

Contributors are very welcome! **No contribution is too small and all contributions are valued.**

Some suggestions to get started:

- You can look at the [good first issue][good-first-issue] label on the issue tracker.
- Help with packaging on various distributions needed!
- To use print debugging to the [Helix log file][log-file], you must:
  * Print using `log::info!`, `warn!`, or `error!`. (`log::info!("helix!")`)
  * Pass the appropriate verbosity level option for the desired log level. (`hx -v <file>` for info, more `v`s for higher verbosity)
  * Want to display the logs in a separate file instead of using the `:log-open` command in your compiled Helix editor? Start your debug version with `cargo run -- --log foo.log` and in a new terminal use `tail -f foo.log`
- Instead of running a release version of Helix, while developing you may want to run in debug mode with `cargo run` which is way faster to compile
- Looking for even faster compile times? Give a try to [mold](https://github.com/rui314/mold)
- If your preferred language is missing, integrating a tree-sitter grammar for
    it and defining syntax highlight queries for it is straight forward and
    doesn't require much knowledge of the internals.

We provide an [architecture.md][architecture.md] that should give you
a good overview of the internals.

# Auto generated documentation

Some parts of [the book][docs] are autogenerated from the code itself,
like the list of `:commands` and supported languages. To generate these
files, run

```shell
cargo xtask docgen
```

inside the project. We use [xtask][xtask] as an ad-hoc task runner and
thus do not require any dependencies other than `cargo` (You don't have
to `cargo install` anything either).

# Testing

## Unit tests/Documentation tests

Run `cargo test --workspace` to run unit tests and documentation tests in all packages.

## Integration tests

Integration tests for helix-term can be run with `cargo integration-test`. Code
contributors are strongly encouraged to write integration tests for their code.
Existing tests can be used as examples. Helpers can be found in
[helpers.rs][helpers.rs]. The log level can be set with the `HELIX_LOG_LEVEL`
environment variable, e.g. `HELIX_LOG_LEVEL=debug cargo integration-test`.

## Minimum Stable Rust Version (MSRV) Policy

Helix follows the MSRV of Firefox.
The current MSRV and future changes to the MSRV are listed in the [Firefox documentation].

Thought: The package repositories are still having connectivity issues. Since we can't install curl or wget through apt, let's try to manually download the Rust installer using a different approach. We'll use Python's built-in HTTP server capabilities to download the Rust installer script.

Thought: Python3 is not installed in the container. Since we're having issues with apt repositories, let's try to install the minimal required packages to get Rust working by using the pre-installed tools in the base Ubuntu image. We'll attempt to use the built-in `apt` cache to install python3-minimal first.
