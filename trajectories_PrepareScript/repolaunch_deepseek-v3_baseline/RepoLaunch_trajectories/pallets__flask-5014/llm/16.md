##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to install dependencies and set up a environment that is able to run the tests of the project.

- You start with an initial Docker container based on ubuntu:22.04.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- No need to clone the project again.

The final objective is to successfully run the tests of the project.


### Python-Specific Instructions:
- Make sure the package is installed from source in editable mode before running tests (e.g., `pip install -e .`)
- Avoid using tox to run tests if possible as it's designed for CI. Read tox.ini to understand setup
- Check requirements.txt, setup.py, or pyproject.toml for dependencies


================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

    Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
        <command>bash command</command>
        e.g. install build-essential: <command>apt-get install -y build-essential</command>
        e.g. view file content: <command>cat README.md</command>
    Search: search the web for if you need some information, generate query and reply with following format:
        <search>the search query</search>
        e.g. <search>how to fix 'No module named setuptools'</search>
        e.g. <search>how to install python3 on ubuntu</search>
        e.g. <search>how to create development environment for python3</search>
    Stop: stop the setup loop once you think the setup is complete, reply with following format:
        <stop></stop>
    

Observation will be the result of running those actions.


Project Structure: the structure of the project, including files and directories.
Related Files: the content of related files of the project that may help you understand the project.
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: <command>your bash command here</command> or <search>your search query</search> or other actions available
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) ...
Thought: I think the setup should be fine
Action: <stop>stop the setup</stop>
Answer: the final result

Flask
=====

Flask is a lightweight `WSGI`_ web application framework. It is designed
to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to
complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around `Werkzeug`_
and `Jinja`_ and has become one of the most popular Python web
application frameworks.

Flask offers suggestions, but doesn't enforce any dependencies or
project layout. It is up to the developer to choose the tools and
libraries they want to use. There are many extensions provided by the
community that make adding new functionality easy.

.. _WSGI: https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/
.. _Werkzeug: https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/
.. _Jinja: https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/


Installing
----------

Install and update using `pip`_:

.. code-block:: text

    $ pip install -U Flask

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/


A Simple Example
----------------

.. code-block:: python

    # save this as app.py
    from flask import Flask

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route("/")
    def hello():
        return "Hello, World!"

.. code-block:: text

    $ flask run
      * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

How to contribute to Flask
==========================

Thank you for considering contributing to Flask!


Support questions
-----------------

Please don't use the issue tracker for this. The issue tracker is a tool
to address bugs and feature requests in Flask itself. Use one of the
following resources for questions about using Flask or issues with your
own code:

-   The ``#questions`` channel on our Discord chat:
    https://discord.gg/pallets
-   Ask on `Stack Overflow`_. Search with Google first using:
    ``site:stackoverflow.com flask {search term, exception message, etc.}``
-   Ask on our `GitHub Discussions`_ for long term discussion or larger
    questions.

.. _Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/flask?tab=Frequent
.. _GitHub Discussions: https://github.com/pallets/flask/discussions


Reporting issues
----------------

Include the following information in your post:

-   Describe what you expected to happen.
-   If possible, include a `minimal reproducible example`_ to help us
    identify the issue. This also helps check that the issue is not with
    your own code.
-   Describe what actually happened. Include the full traceback if there
    was an exception.
-   List your Python and Flask versions. If possible, check if this
    issue is already fixed in the latest releases or the latest code in
    the repository.

.. _minimal reproducible example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example


Submitting patches
------------------

If there is not an open issue for what you want to submit, prefer
opening one for discussion before working on a PR. You can work on any
issue that doesn't have an open PR linked to it or a maintainer assigned
to it. These show up in the sidebar. No need to ask if you can work on
an issue that interests you.

Include the following in your patch:

-   Use `Black`_ to format your code. This and other tools will run
    automatically if you install `pre-commit`_ using the instructions
    below.
-   Include tests if your patch adds or changes code. Make sure the test
    fails without your patch.
-   Update any relevant docs pages and docstrings. Docs pages and
    docstrings should be wrapped at 72 characters.
-   Add an entry in ``CHANGES.rst``. Use the same style as other
    entries. Also include ``.. versionchanged::`` inline changelogs in
    relevant docstrings.

.. _Black: https://black.readthedocs.io
.. _pre-commit: https://pre-commit.com


First time setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-   Download and install the `latest version of git`_.
-   Configure git with your `username`_ and `email`_.

    .. code-block:: text

Start coding
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-   Create a branch to identify the issue you would like to work on. If
    you're submitting a bug or documentation fix, branch off of the
    latest ".x" branch.

    .. code-block:: text

        $ git fetch origin
        $ git checkout -b your-branch-name origin/2.0.x

    If you're submitting a feature addition or change, branch off of the
    "main" branch.

    .. code-block:: text

        $ git fetch origin
        $ git checkout -b your-branch-name origin/main

-   Using your favorite editor, make your changes,
    `committing as you go`_.
-   Include tests that cover any code changes you make. Make sure the
    test fails without your patch. Run the tests as described below.
-   Push your commits to your fork on GitHub and
    `create a pull request`_. Link to the issue being addressed with
    ``fixes #123`` in the pull request.

    .. code-block:: text

        $ git push --set-upstream fork your-branch-name

.. _committing as you go: https://afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/commandlinegit.html#commit-your-changes
.. _create a pull request: https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request


Running the tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the basic test suite with pytest.

.. code-block:: text

    $ pytest

This runs the tests for the current environment, which is usually
sufficient. CI will run the full suite when you submit your pull
request. You can run the full test suite with tox if you don't want to
wait.

.. code-block:: text

    $ tox


Running test coverage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generating a report of lines that do not have test coverage can indicate
where to start contributing. Run ``pytest`` using ``coverage`` and
generate a report.

.. code-block:: text

    $ pip install coverage
    $ coverage run -m pytest
    $ coverage html

Open ``htmlcov/index.html`` in your browser to explore the report.

Read more about `coverage <https://coverage.readthedocs.io>`__.


Building the docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build the docs in the ``docs`` directory using Sphinx.

.. code-block:: text

    $ cd docs
    $ make html

Open ``_build/html/index.html`` in your browser to view the docs.

Read more about `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`__.

Installation
============


Python Version
--------------

We recommend using the latest version of Python. Flask supports Python
3.7 and newer.


Dependencies
------------

These distributions will be installed automatically when installing Flask.

* `Werkzeug`_ implements WSGI, the standard Python interface between
  applications and servers.
* `Jinja`_ is a template language that renders the pages your application
  serves.
* `MarkupSafe`_ comes with Jinja. It escapes untrusted input when rendering
  templates to avoid injection attacks.
* `ItsDangerous`_ securely signs data to ensure its integrity. This is used
  to protect Flask's session cookie.
* `Click`_ is a framework for writing command line applications. It provides
  the ``flask`` command and allows adding custom management commands.

.. _Werkzeug: https://palletsprojects.com/p/werkzeug/
.. _Jinja: https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/
.. _MarkupSafe: https://palletsprojects.com/p/markupsafe/
.. _ItsDangerous: https://palletsprojects.com/p/itsdangerous/
.. _Click: https://palletsprojects.com/p/click/


Optional dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These distributions will not be installed automatically. Flask will detect and
use them if you install them.

* `Blinker`_ provides support for :doc:`signals`.
* `python-dotenv`_ enables support for :ref:`dotenv` when running ``flask``
  commands.
* `Watchdog`_ provides a faster, more efficient reloader for the development
  server.

.. _Blinker: https://blinker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
.. _python-dotenv: https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv#readme
.. _watchdog: https://pythonhosted.org/watchdog/


greenlet
~~~~~~~~

You may choose to use gevent or eventlet with your application. In this
case, greenlet>=1.0 is required. When using PyPy, PyPy>=7.3.7 is
required.

These are not minimum supported versions, they only indicate the first
versions that added necessary features. You should use the latest
versions of each.


Virtual environments
--------------------

Use a virtual environment to manage the dependencies for your project, both in
development and in production.

What problem does a virtual environment solve? The more Python projects you
have, the more likely it is that you need to work with different versions of
Python libraries, or even Python itself. Newer versions of libraries for one
project can break compatibility in another project.

Virtual environments are independent groups of Python libraries, one for each
project. Packages installed for one project will not affect other projects or
the operating system's packages.

Python comes bundled with the :mod:`venv` module to create virtual
environments.


.. _install-create-env:

Create an environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a project folder and a :file:`.venv` folder within:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: macOS/Linux

      .. code-block:: text

         $ mkdir myproject
         $ cd myproject
         $ python3 -m venv .venv

   .. group-tab:: Windows

      .. code-block:: text

         > mkdir myproject
         > cd myproject
         > py -3 -m venv .venv


.. _install-activate-env:

Activate the environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you work on your project, activate the corresponding environment:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: macOS/Linux

      .. code-block:: text

         $ . .venv/bin/activate

   .. group-tab:: Windows

      .. code-block:: text

         > .venv\Scripts\activate

Your shell prompt will change to show the name of the activated
environment.


Install Flask
-------------

Within the activated environment, use the following command to install
Flask:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install Flask

Flask is now installed. Check out the :doc:`/quickstart` or go to the
:doc:`Documentation Overview </index>`.

```
