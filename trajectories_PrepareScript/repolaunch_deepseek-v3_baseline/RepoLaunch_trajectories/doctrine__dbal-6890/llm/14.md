##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

### File:
------ START FILE phpunit.xml.dist ------
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!--
    Use this configuration file as a template to run the tests against any dbms.
    Procedure:
        1) Save a copy of this file with a name of your choosing. It doesn't matter
           where you place it as long as you know where it is.
           i.e. "mysqlconf.xml" (It needs the ending .xml).
        2) Edit the file and fill in your settings (database name, type, username, etc.)
           Just change the "value"s, not the names of the var elements.
        3) To run the tests against the database type the following from within the
           tests/ folder: phpunit -c <filename> ...
           Example: phpunit -c mysqlconf.xml

            By default, the tests are run against SQLite.
