##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to install dependencies and set up a environment that is able to run the tests of the project.

- You start with an initial Docker container based on ubuntu:22.04.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- No need to clone the project again.

The final objective is to successfully run the tests of the project.


### C-Specific Instructions:
- Install build-essential if not available: `apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential`
- Use `make` to build the project (check for Makefile)
- Use `gcc` or `clang` directly if no Makefile exists
- Check for CMakeLists.txt and use `cmake` if available
- Install dependencies through package manager (apt, yum, etc.)
- Look for configure scripts and run `./configure && make`


================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

    Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
        <command>bash command</command>
        e.g. install build-essential: <command>apt-get install -y build-essential</command>
        e.g. view file content: <command>cat README.md</command>
    Search: search the web for if you need some information, generate query and reply with following format:
        <search>the search query</search>
        e.g. <search>how to fix 'No module named setuptools'</search>
        e.g. <search>how to install python3 on ubuntu</search>
        e.g. <search>how to create development environment for python3</search>
    Stop: stop the setup loop once you think the setup is complete, reply with following format:
        <stop></stop>
    

Observation will be the result of running those actions.


Project Structure: the structure of the project, including files and directories.
Related Files: the content of related files of the project that may help you understand the project.
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: <command>your bash command here</command> or <search>your search query</search> or other actions available
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) ...
Thought: I think the setup should be fine
Action: <stop>stop the setup</stop>
Answer: the final result

<!-- summary: About the Build-time Library Manager -->

# mrbgems

mrbgems is a library manager to integrate C and Ruby extensions in an easy and
standardised way into mruby. Conventionally, each mrbgem name is prefixed by
`mruby-`, e.g. `mruby-time` for a gem that provides `Time` class functionality.

## Usage

You have to activate mrbgems explicitly in your build configuration. To add
a gem, add the following line to your build configuration file, for example:

```ruby
conf.gem '/path/to/your/gem/dir'
```

You can also use a relative path to specify a gem.

```ruby
conf.gem 'examples/mrbgems/ruby_extension_example'
```

In that case,

- if your build configuration file is in the `build_config` directory, it's
  relative from `MRUBY_ROOT`.
- otherwise, it is relative from the directory where your build configuration is.

A remote GIT repository location for a GEM is also supported:

```ruby
conf.gem :git => 'https://github.com/masuidrive/mrbgems-example.git', :branch => 'master'
conf.gem :github => 'masuidrive/mrbgems-example', :branch => 'master'
conf.gem :bitbucket => 'mruby/mrbgems-example', :branch => 'master'
```

NOTE: `:bitbucket` option supports only git. Hg is unsupported in this
version.

You can specify the subdirectory of the repository with `:path` option:

```ruby
conf.gem github: 'mruby/mruby', path: 'mrbgems/mruby-socket'
```

To use mrbgem from [mgem-list](https://github.com/mruby/mgem-list) use `:mgem` option:

```ruby
conf.gem :mgem => 'mruby-yaml'
conf.gem :mgem => 'yaml' # 'mruby-' prefix could be omitted
```

For specifying the commit hash to checkout use `:checksum_hash` option:

```ruby
conf.gem mgem: 'mruby-redis', checksum_hash: '3446d19fc4a3f9697b5ddbf2a904f301c42f2f4e'
```

If there are missing dependencies, mrbgem dependencies solver will reference
mrbgem from the core or mgem-list.

Note that if more than one git-based gem has the same base name
(i.e. the default checkout directory name), it is (now) an error
**UNLESS** they have the same repository URL, branch name and
commit-id (i.e. checksum hash). You can bypass this by explicitly
importing your preferred version **first** and setting the
`canonical:` option to `true`:

```ruby
conf.gem github: 'me/mruby-yaml', branch: 'my-hacked-branch', canonical: true
```

If you do this, the system will (mostly) silently ignore other
attempts to clone a gem with this name.

Note that this only affects cloning the gem from git. It does not
resolve version conflicts. If the version as specified in the gem's
rakefile is incompatible with a dependency, your build will still
fail.

### Tweak the gem in your build configuration file

You can give blocks in the `conf.gem` call to make adjustments for
environments where the original gem does not expect them:

```ruby
conf.gem core: "mruby-bin-mirb" do |g|
  # For cross build to NetBSD
  g.linker.libraries = %w(edit termcap)
end
```

However, it should be used with caution, as it may deviate from the intent
of the gem's author.

### Gem Testing

If you enable unit tests in your build with `enable_test`, tests will be
generated for all gems and their dependencies by default. If necessary, it is
possible to suppress tests for a specific gem like so:

```ruby
conf.gem 'mruby-noisygem' do |g|
  g.skip_test = true
end
```

However, it is considered best practice to leave all tests enabled whenever
possible. A warning message will be generated for each gem with disabled tests.

## GemBox

There are instances when you wish to add a collection of mrbgems into mruby at
once, or be able to substitute mrbgems based on configuration, without having to
add each gem to your build configuration file. A packaged collection of mrbgems
is called a GemBox. A GemBox is a file that contains a list of mrbgems to load
into mruby, in the same format as if you were adding them to the build config
via `config.gem`, but wrapped in an `MRuby::GemBox` object. GemBoxes are
loaded into mruby via `config.gembox 'boxname'`.

Below we have created a GemBox containing `mruby-time` and `mrbgems-example`:

```ruby
MRuby::GemBox.new do |conf|
  conf.gem "#{root}/mrbgems/mruby-time"
  conf.gem :github => 'masuidrive/mrbgems-example'
end
```

As mentioned, the GemBox uses the same conventions as `MRuby::Build`. The GemBox
must be saved with a `.gembox` extension inside the `mrbgems` directory to be
picked up by mruby.

To use this example GemBox, we save it as `custom.gembox` inside the `mrbgems`
directory in mruby, and add the following to your build configuration file inside
the build block:

```ruby
conf.gembox 'custom'
```

This will cause the `custom` GemBox to be read in during the build process,
adding `mruby-time` and `mrbgems-example` to the build.

If you want, you can put GemBox outside the mruby directory. In that case you must
specify an absolute path like below.

```ruby
conf.gembox "#{ENV["HOME"]}/mygemboxes/custom"
```

There are two GemBoxes that ship with mruby: [default](../../mrbgems/default.gembox)
and [full-core](../../mrbgems/full-core.gembox). The [default](../../mrbgems/default.gembox) GemBox
contains several core components of mruby, and [full-core](../../mrbgems/full-core.gembox)
contains every gem found in the `mrbgems` directory.

## GEM Structure

The maximal GEM structure looks like this:

```
+- GEM_NAME             <- Name of GEM
    |
    +- README.md        <- Readme for GEM
    |
    +- mrbgem.rake      <- GEM Specification
    |
    +- include/         <- Header for Ruby extension (will exported)
    |
    +- mrblib/          <- Source for Ruby extension
    |
    +- src/             <- Source for C extension
    |
    +- tools/           <- Source for Executable (in C)
    |
    +- test/            <- Test code (Ruby)
```

The `mrblib` directory contains pure Ruby files to extend mruby. The `src` directory
contains C/C++ files to extend mruby. The `include` directory contains C/C++ header
files. The `test` directory contains C/C++ and pure Ruby files for testing purposes
which will be used by `mrbtest`. `mrbgem.rake` contains the specification
to compile C and Ruby files. `README.md` is a short description of your GEM.

## Build process

mrbgems expects a specification file called `mrbgem.rake` inside of your
GEM directory. A typical GEM specification could look like this for example:

```ruby
MRuby::Gem::Specification.new('c_and_ruby_extension_example') do |spec|
  spec.license = 'MIT'
  spec.author  = 'mruby developers'
  spec.summary = 'Example mrbgem using C and Ruby'
end
```

The mrbgems build process will use this specification to compile Object and Ruby
files. The compilation results will be added to `lib/libmruby.a`. This file exposes
the GEM functionality to tools like `mruby` and `mirb`.

The following properties can be set inside your `MRuby::Gem::Specification` for
information purpose:

- `spec.license` or `spec.licenses` (A single license or a list of them under which this GEM is licensed)
- `spec.author` or `spec.authors` (Developer name or a list of them)
- `spec.version` (Current version)
- `spec.description` (Detailed description)
- `spec.summary`
  - One line short description of mrbgem.
  - Printed in build summary of rake when set.
- `spec.homepage` (Homepage)
- `spec.requirements` (External requirements as information for user)

The `license` and `author` properties are required in every GEM!

In case your GEM is depending on other GEMs please use
`spec.add_dependency(gem, *requirements[, default_get_info])` like:

```ruby
MRuby::Gem::Specification.new('c_and_ruby_extension_example') do |spec|
  spec.license = 'MIT'
  spec.author  = 'mruby developers'

  # Add GEM dependency mruby-parser.
  # The version must be between 1.0.0 and 1.5.2 .
  spec.add_dependency('mruby-parser', '>= 1.0.0', '<= 1.5.2')

  # Use any version of mruby-uv from GitHub.
  spec.add_dependency('mruby-uv', '>= 0.0.0', :github => 'mattn/mruby-uv')

  # Use latest mruby-onig-regexp from GitHub. (version requirements can be omitted)
  spec.add_dependency('mruby-onig-regexp', :github => 'mattn/mruby-onig-regexp')

  # You can add extra mgems active only on test
  spec.add_test_dependency('mruby-process', :github => 'iij/mruby-process')
end
```

The version requirements and default gem information are optional.

Version requirement supports following operators:

- '=': is equal
- '!=': is not equal
- '>': is greater
- '<': is lesser
- '>=': is equal or greater
- '<=': is equal or lesser
- '~>': is equal or greater and is lesser than the next major version
  - example 1: '~> 2.2.2' means '>= 2.2.2' and '< 2.3.0'
  - example 2: '~> 2.2' means '>= 2.2.0' and '< 3.0.0'

When more than one version requirements is passed, the dependency must satisfy all of it.

You can have default gem to use as dependency when it's not defined in your build configuration.
When the last argument of `add_dependency` call is `Hash`, it will be treated as default gem information.
Its format is same as argument of method `MRuby::Build#gem`, expect that it can't be treated as path gem location.

When a special version of dependency is required,
use `MRuby::Build#gem` in the build configuration to override default gem.

If you have conflicting GEMs use the following method:

- `spec.add_conflict(gem, *requirements)`
  - The `requirements` argument is same as in `add_dependency` method.

like following code:

```ruby
MRuby::Gem::Specification.new 'some-regexp-binding' do |spec|
  spec.license = 'BSD'
  spec.author = 'John Doe'

  spec.add_conflict 'mruby-onig-regexp', '> 0.0.0'
  spec.add_conflict 'mruby-hs-regexp'
  spec.add_conflict 'mruby-pcre-regexp'
  spec.add_conflict 'mruby-regexp-pcre'
end
```

In case your GEM has more complex build requirements you can use
the following options additionally inside your GEM specification:

- `spec.cc.flags` (C compiler flags)
- `spec.cc.defines` (C compiler defines)
- `spec.cc.include_paths` (C compiler include paths)
- `spec.linker.flags` (Linker flags)
- `spec.linker.libraries` (Linker libraries)
- `spec.linker.library_paths` (Linker additional library path)
- `spec.bins` (Generate binary file)
- `spec.rbfiles` (Ruby files to compile)
- `spec.objs` (Object files to compile)
- `spec.test_rbfiles` (Ruby test files for integration into mrbtest)
- `spec.test_objs` (Object test files for integration into mrbtest)
- `spec.test_preload` (Initialization files for mrbtest)

You also can use `spec.mruby.cc` and `spec.mruby.linker` to add extra global parameters for the compiler and linker.

### include_paths and dependency

Your GEM can export include paths to another GEMs that depends on your GEM.
By default, `/...absolute path.../{GEM_NAME}/include` will be exported.
So it is recommended not to put GEM's local header files on include/.

These exports are retroactive.
For example: when B depends on C and A depends on B, A will get include paths exported by C.

Exported include_paths are automatically appended to GEM local include_paths by rake.
You can use `spec.export_include_paths` accessor if you want more complex build.

## C Extension

mruby can be extended with C. This is possible by using the C API to
integrate C libraries into mruby.

### Preconditions

mrbgems expects that you have implemented a C method called
`mrb_YOURGEMNAME_gem_init(mrb_state)`. `YOURGEMNAME` will be replaced
by the name of your GEM. If you call your GEM `c_extension_example`, your
initialisation method could look like this:

```c
void
mrb_c_extension_example_gem_init(mrb_state* mrb) {
  struct RClass *class_cextension = mrb_define_module(mrb, "CExtension");
  mrb_define_class_method(mrb, class_cextension, "c_method", mrb_c_method, MRB_ARGS_NONE());
}
```

### Finalize

mrbgems expects that you have implemented a C method called
`mrb_YOURGEMNAME_gem_final(mrb_state)`. `YOURGEMNAME` will be replaced
by the name of your GEM. If you call your GEM `c_extension_example`, your
finalizer method could look like this:

```c
void
mrb_c_extension_example_gem_final(mrb_state* mrb) {
  free(someone);
}
```

### Example

```
+- c_extension_example/
    |
    +- README.md        (Optional)
    |
    +- src/
    |   |
    |   +- example.c    <- C extension source
    |
    +- test/
    |   |
    |   +- example.rb   <- Test code for C extension
    |
    +- mrbgem.rake      <- GEM specification
```

## Ruby Extension

mruby can be extended with pure Ruby. It is possible to override existing
classes or add new ones in this way. Put all Ruby files into the `mrblib`
directory.

### Pre-Conditions

none

### Example

```
+- ruby_extension_example/
    |
    +- README.md        (Optional)
    |
    +- mrblib/
    |   |
    |   +- example.rb   <- Ruby extension source
    |
    +- test/
    |   |
    |   +- example.rb   <- Test code for Ruby extension
    |
    +- mrbgem.rake      <- GEM specification
```

## C and Ruby Extension

mruby can be extended with C and Ruby at the same time. It is possible to
override existing classes or add new ones in this way. Put all Ruby files
into the `mrblib` directory and all C files into the `src` directory.

mruby codes under `mrblib` directory would be executed after gem init C
function is called. Make sure _mruby script_ depends on _C code_ and
_C code_ doesn't depend on _mruby script_.

### Pre-Conditions

See C and Ruby example.

### Example

```
+- c_and_ruby_extension_example/
    |
    +- README.md        (Optional)
    |
    +- mrblib/
    |   |
    |   +- example.rb   <- Ruby extension source
    |
    +- src/
    |   |
    |   +- example.c    <- C extension source
    |
    +- test/
    |   |
    |   +- example.rb   <- Test code for C and Ruby extension
    |
    +- mrbgem.rake      <- GEM specification
```

## Binary gems

Some gems can generate executables under `bin` directory. Those gems are called
binary gems. Names of binary gems are conventionally prefixed by `mruby-bin`,
e.g. `mruby-bin-mirb` and `mruby-bin-strip`.

To specify the name of executable, you need to specify `spec.bins` in the
`mrbgem.rake`. The entry point `main()` should be in the C source file under
`tools/<bin>/*.c` where `<bin>` is a name of the executable. C files under the
`<bin>` directory are compiled and linked to the executable, but not included in
`libmruby.a`, whereas files under `mrblib` and `src` are.

It is strongly recommended not to include `mrblib` and `src` directories in the
binary gems, to separate normal gems and binary gems.

### Example

```
+- mruby-bin-example/
    |
    +- README.md          (Optional)
    |
    +- bintest/
    |   |
    |   +- example.rb     <- Test code for binary gem
    |
    +- mrbgem.rake        <- Gem specification
    |
    +- mrblib/            <- Source for Ruby extension (Optional)
    |
    +- src/               <- Source for C extension (Optional)
    |
    +- tools/
        |
        +- example/       <- Executable name directory
            |
            +- example.c  <- Source for Executable (includes main)
```

## What is mruby

mruby is the lightweight implementation of the Ruby language complying to (part
of) the [ISO standard][ISO-standard] with more recent features provided by Ruby 3.x.
Also, its syntax is Ruby 3.x compatible except for pattern matching.

You can link and embed mruby within your application. The "mruby" interpreter
program and the interactive "mirb" shell are provided as examples. You can also
compile Ruby programs into compiled byte code using the "mrbc" compiler. All
these tools are located in the "bin" directory. "mrbc" can also generate
compiled byte code in a C source file. See the "mrbtest" program under the
"test" directory for an example.

This achievement was sponsored by the Regional Innovation Creation R&D Programs
of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan.

## How to get mruby

To get mruby, you can download the stable version 3.3.0 from the official mruby
GitHub repository or clone the trunk of the mruby source tree with the "git
clone" command. You can also install and compile mruby using [ruby-install](https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install), [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build) or [rvm](https://github.com/rvm/rvm).

The latest development version of mruby can be downloaded via the following URL: [https://github.com/mruby/mruby/zipball/master](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/zipball/master)

The trunk of the mruby source tree can be checked out with the
following command:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/mruby/mruby.git
```

## mruby homepage

The URL of the mruby homepage is: <https://mruby.org>.

## Mailing list

We don't have a mailing list, but you can use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/issues).

## How to compile, test, and install (mruby and gems)

For the simplest case, type

```console
rake all test
```

See the [compile.md](doc/guides/compile.md) file for the detail.

## Building documentation

There are two sets of documentation in mruby: the mruby API (generated by YARD) and C API (Doxygen and Graphviz)

To build both of them, simply go

```console
rake doc
```

You can also view them in your browser

```console
rake view_api
rake view_capi
```

## How to customize mruby (mrbgems)

mruby contains a package manager called "mrbgems" that you can use to create
extensions in C and/or Ruby. For a guide on how to use mrbgems, consult the
[mrbgems.md](doc/guides/mrbgems.md) file, and for example code, refer to the
[examples/mrbgems/](examples/mrbgems) folder.

## License

mruby is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

## Note for License

mruby has chosen a MIT License due to its permissive license allowing
developers to target various environments such as embedded systems.
However, the license requires the display of the copyright notice and license
information in manuals for instance. Doing so for big projects can be
complicated or troublesome. This is why mruby has decided to display "mruby
developers" as the copyright name to make it simple conventionally.
In the future, mruby might ask you to distribute your new code
(that you will commit,) under the MIT License as a member of
"mruby developers" but contributors will keep their copyright.
(We did not intend for contributors to transfer or waive their copyrights,
actual copyright holder name (contributors) will be listed in the [AUTHORS](AUTHORS)
file.)

Please ask us if you want to distribute your code under another license.

## How to Contribute

<!-- summary: About Build-time Configurations -->

# mruby configuration macros

## The configuration file

You can do the build configuration in the build configuration file. The default
configuration file is `build_config/default.rb`.

You can specify your own configuration file by the `MRUBY_CONFIG` environment
variable (you can use `CONFIG` for shorthand for `MRUBY_CONFIG`). If the path
doesn't exist, `build_config/${MRUBY_CONFIG}.rb` is used.

## How to use these macros

Just add the configuration value to the `MRuby::Build#defines` attribute.
This is the same for `MRuby::CrossBuild`.

```ruby
# build_config.rb

MRuby::Build.new do |conf|
  ...
  conf.defines << 'MRB_GC_FIXED_ARENA'
  conf.defines << 'MRB_NO_METHOD_CACHE'
  ...
end
```

**_NOTE_**

- Use common definitions (`conf.defines`) instead of per-compiler definitions (e.g., `conf.cc.defines`) unless there is a special reason not to.
- It is now deprecated to edit the `include/mruby/mrbconf.h` file or give it directly as a compiler flag, as was the case before.

## stdio setting

`MRB_NO_STDIO`

- When defined `<stdio.h>` functions won't be used.
- Some features will be disabled when this is enabled:
  - `mrb_irep` load/dump from/to file.
  - Compiling mruby script from a file.
  - Printing features in **src/print.c**.

## Debug macros

`MRB_USE_DEBUG_HOOK`

- When defined code fetch hook and debug OP hook will be enabled.
- When using any of the hook set function pointer `code_fetch_hook` and/or `debug_op_hook` of `mrb_state`.
- Fetch hook will be called before any OP.
- Debug OP hook will be called when dispatching `OP_DEBUG`.

`MRB_DEBUG`

- When defined `mrb_assert*` macro will be defined with macros from `<assert.h>`.
- Could be enabled via `enable_debug` method of `MRuby::Build`.

## Stack configuration

`MRB_STACK_EXTEND_DOUBLING`

- If defined doubles the stack size when extending it.
- Otherwise extends stack with `MRB_STACK_GROWTH`.

`MRB_STACK_GROWTH`

- Default value is `128`.
- Used in stack extending.
- Ignored when `MRB_STACK_EXTEND_DOUBLING` is defined.

`MRB_STACK_MAX`

- Default value is `0x40000 - MRB_STACK_GROWTH`.
- Raises `RuntimeError` when stack size exceeds this value.

## Primitive type configuration

`MRB_USE_FLOAT32`

- When defined single-precision floating-point type(C type `float`) is used as `mrb_float`.
- Otherwise, double-precision floating-point type(C type `double`) is used as `mrb_float`.

`MRB_NO_FLOAT`

- When defined removes floating-point numbers from mruby.
- It makes mruby easier to handle in "Micro-controller without FPU" and "Kernel Space".

`MRB_INT32`

- When defined, or `MRB_INT64` are not defined on 32-bit CPU mode, `mrb_int` will be defined as `int32_t`.
- Conflicts with `MRB_INT64`.

`MRB_INT64`

- When defined, or `MRB_INT32` are not defined on 64-bit CPU mode, `mrb_int` will be defined as `int64_t`.
- Conflicts with `MRB_INT32`.

## Garbage collector configuration

`MRB_GC_STRESS`

- When defined full GC is emitted per each `RBasic` allocation.
- Mainly used in memory manager debugging.
- If defined at the same time as `MRB_DEBUG`, full GC is emitted also per each heap allocation (`mrb_malloc()` or etc.).
  This configuration slows down mruby execution by a factor of 2 to 3 or even more.

`MRB_GC_TURN_OFF_GENERATIONAL`

- When defined turns generational GC off by default.

`MRB_GC_FIXED_ARENA`

- When defined used fixed size GC arena.
- Raises `RuntimeError` when this is defined and GC arena size exceeds `MRB_GC_ARENA_SIZE`.
- Useful tracking unnecessary mruby object allocation.

`MRB_GC_ARENA_SIZE`

- Default value is `100`.
- Ignored when `MRB_GC_FIXED_ARENA` isn't defined.
- Defines fixed GC arena size.

`MRB_HEAP_PAGE_SIZE`

- Default value is `1024`.
- Specifies number of `RBasic` per each heap page.
- To calculate the number of bytes per heap page, it is "(size of management data per heap page) + (size per object) \* `MRB_HEAP_PAGE_SIZE`".
  In mruby 3.1.0, the "size of management data per heap page" is 6 words, also "size per object" is 6 words.
  For a 32-bit CPU, `(6 * 4) + (6 * 4) * MRB_HEAP_PAGE_SIZE` gives the bytes of size per heap page.
  Conversely, for example, to keep the size per heap page to 4 Ki bytes,
  calculate `(4096 - (6 * 4)) / (6 * 4)` to specify `MRB_HEAP_PAGE_SIZE=169`.

## Memory pool configuration

`POOL_ALIGNMENT`

- Default value is `4`.
- If you're allocating data types that requires alignment more than default value define the
  largest value of required alignment.

`POOL_PAGE_SIZE`

- Default value is `16000`.
- Specifies page size of pool page.
- Smaller the value is increases memory overhead.

## State atexit configuration

`MRB_FIXED_STATE_ATEXIT_STACK`

- If defined enables fixed size `mrb_state` atexit stack.
- Raises `RuntimeError` when `mrb_state_atexit` call count to same `mrb_state` exceeds
  `MRB_FIXED_STATE_ATEXIT_STACK_SIZE`'s value.

`MRB_FIXED_STATE_ATEXIT_STACK_SIZE`

- Default value is `5`.
- If `MRB_FIXED_STATE_ATEXIT_STACK` isn't defined this macro is ignored.

## `mrb_value` configuration

`MRB_ENDIAN_BIG`

- If defined compiles mruby for big endian machines.
- Used in `MRB_NAN_BOXING`.
- Some mrbgem use this mrbconf.

`MRB_NAN_BOXING`

- If defined represent `mrb_value` in boxed `double`.
- Conflicts with `MRB_USE_FLOAT32` and `MRB_NO_FLOAT`.

`MRB_WORD_BOXING`

- If defined represent `mrb_value` as a word.
- If defined `Float` will be a mruby object with `RBasic`.

## Reduce heap memory configuration

`MRB_USE_ETEXT_RO_DATA_P`

- Use `etext` and `edata` section addresses defined by the linker to detect read-only data.
- Those addresses are widely available, but not portable, nor standardized.
- This macro is defined by default on User-mode Linux.

`MRB_NO_DEFAULT_RO_DATA_P`

- Define this macro when the default `mrb_ro_data_p()` does not work for any reason.

`MRB_USE_CUSTOM_RO_DATA_P`

- Please try if `MRB_USE_LINK_TIME_RO_DATA_P` is not available.
- The `mrb_ro_data_p()` function is implemented by the user in an arbitrary file.
- The prototype declaration is `mrb_bool mrb_ro_data_p(const char *ptr)`.
- Return `TRUE` if `ptr` is in the read-only section, otherwise return `FALSE`.

## Other configuration

`MRB_MALLOC_TRIM`

- call `malloc_trim(0)` for each `mrb_full_gc()` call

`MRB_UTF8_STRING`

- Adds UTF-8 encoding support to character-oriented String instance methods.
- If it isn't defined, they only support the US-ASCII encoding.

`MRB_STR_LENGTH_MAX`

- The maximum length of strings (default 1MB)
- set this value to zero to skip the check

`MRB_ARY_LENGTH_MAX`

- The maximum length of arrays (default 1MB)
- set this value to zero to skip the check

`MRB_FUNCALL_ARGC_MAX`

- Default value is `16`.
- Specifies 4th argument(`argc`) max value of `mrb_funcall`.
- Raises `ArgumentError` when the `argc` argument is bigger then this value `mrb_funcall`.

`KHASH_DEFAULT_SIZE`

- Default value is `32`.
- Specifies default size of khash table bucket.
- Used in `kh_init_ ## name` function.

`MRB_NO_METHOD_CACHE`

- Disable method cache to save memory.

`MRB_METHOD_CACHE_SIZE`

- Default value is `256`.
- Ignored if `MRB_NO_METHOD_CACHE` is defined.
- Need to be the power of 2.

`MRB_USE_ALL_SYMBOLS`

- Make it available `Symbol.all_symbols` in `mrbgems/mruby-symbol-ext`
- Increase heap memory usage.

`MRB_USE_VM_SWITCH_DISPATCH`

- Turn on switch dispatch in VM loop

<!-- summary: About the Compile -->

# Compile

mruby uses Rake to compile and cross-compile all libraries and
binaries.

## Prerequisites

To compile mruby out of the source code you need the following tools:

- C Compiler (e.g. `gcc` or `clang`)
- Linker (e.g. `gcc` or `clang`)
- Archive utility (e.g. `ar`)
- Ruby 2.5 or later (e.g. `ruby` or `jruby`)

Optional:

- Git (to update mruby source and integrate mrbgems easier)
- C++ compiler (to use mrbgems which include `*.cpp`, `*.cxx`, `*.cc`)
- Bison (to compile `mrbgems/mruby-compiler/core/parse.y`)
- gperf (to compile `mrbgems/mruby-compiler/cor
