##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to verify whether the environment for the given project is set up correctly. Your colleague has set up a Docker environment for the project. You need to verify if it can successfully run the tests of the project.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- The container is based on ubuntu:22.04.
- The setup commands that your colleague has run are ['apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential', 'apt-get install -y ruby', 'apt-get install -y bison gperf', 'rake all test']
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- Use the same test framework as your colleague, because that aligns with the setup stage.
- Only test commands, skip linting/packaging/publishing commands.
- Do not change the state of the environment, your task is to verify not to fix it. If you see issues, report it not fix it.
- You can tolerate a few test cases failures—as long as most tests pass, it's good enough. ## Important Note:

Your test command must output detailed pass/fail status for each test item. This is mandatory. For example, with pytest, use the -rA option to get output like:
```
...
PASSED tests/test_resources.py::test_fetch_centromeres
PASSED tests/test_vis.py::test_to_ucsc_colorstring
```
Since we need to parse the test output to extract a test item → status mapping, **this requirement is mandatory**. If you observed that your test command does not produce such detailed output, you must adjust it accordingly.

In summary, your goal is:
1. Write the test commands that could output detailed pass/fail status for each test item, you can iterate until it does. (this is mandatory, DO NOT ignore this requirement!!! This is your obligation to correctly identify the test commands to run the test suite of the project, and find a way to output detailed pass/fail status)
2. Run the test command to verify if the environment is set up correctly. If not, report any observed issues. If you think the setup is correct, report none issue.

================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

    Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
        <command>...</command>
        e.g. run pytest with detailed output turned on: <command>pytest -rA</command>
        e.g. <command>tox -- -rA</command>
    Issue: stop the verify loop once you think the setup is complete, and reply with the issue of the setup:
        <issue>...</issue>
        e.g. <issue>some dependency is missing, run `pytest` failed</issue>
        e.g. <issue>None</issue> if you think the setup is correct (remember to tolerate a few test cases failures as long as most tests pass)
    

Observation will be the result of running those actions.


Project Structure: the structure of the project, including files and directories.
Related Files: the content of related files of the project that may help you understand the project.
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: <command>your bash command here</command> or <search>your search query</search> or other actions available
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) ...
Thought: I think the setup should be fine
Action: <stop>stop the setup</stop>

<!-- summary: About the Build-time Library Manager -->

# mrbgems

mrbgems is a library manager to integrate C and Ruby extensions in an easy and
standardised way into mruby. Conventionally, each mrbgem name is prefixed by
`mruby-`, e.g. `mruby-time` for a gem that provides `Time` class functionality.

## Usage

You have to activate mrbgems explicitly in your build configuration. To add
a gem, add the following line to your build configuration file, for example:

```ruby
conf.gem '/path/to/your/gem/dir'
```

You can also use a relative path to specify a gem.

```ruby
conf.gem 'examples/mrbgems/ruby_extension_example'
```

In that case,

- if your build configuration file is in the `build_config` directory, it's
  relative from `MRUBY_ROOT`.
- otherwise, it is relative from the directory where your build configuration is.

A remote GIT repository location for a GEM is also supported:

```ruby
conf.gem :git => 'https://github.com/masuidrive/mrbgems-example.git', :branch => 'master'
conf.gem :github => 'masuidrive/mrbgems-example', :branch => 'master'
conf.gem :bitbucket => 'mruby/mrbgems-example', :branch => 'master'
```

NOTE: `:bitbucket` option supports only git. Hg is unsupported in this
version.

You can specify the subdirectory of the repository with `:path` option:

```ruby
conf.gem github: 'mruby/mruby', path: 'mrbgems/mruby-socket'
```

To use mrbgem from [mgem-list](https://github.com/mruby/mgem-list) use `:mgem` option:

```ruby
conf.gem :mgem => 'mruby-yaml'
conf.gem :mgem => 'yaml' # 'mruby-' prefix could be omitted
```

For specifying the commit hash to checkout use `:checksum_hash` option:

```ruby
conf.gem mgem: 'mruby-redis', checksum_hash: '3446d19fc4a3f9697b5ddbf2a904f301c42f2f4e'
```

If there are missing dependencies, mrbgem dependencies solver will reference
mrbgem from the core or mgem-list.

Note that if more than one git-based gem has the same base name
(i.e. the default checkout directory name), it is (now) an error
**UNLESS** they have the same repository URL, branch name and
commit-id (i.e. checksum hash). You can bypass this by explicitly
importing your preferred version **first** and setting the
`canonical:` option to `true`:

```ruby
conf.gem github: 'me/mruby-yaml', branch: 'my-hacked-branch', canonical: true
```

If you do this, the system will (mostly) silently ignore other
attempts to clone a gem with this name.

Note that this only affects cloning the gem from git. It does not
resolve version conflicts. If the version as specified in the gem's
rakefile is incompatible with a dependency, your build will still
fail.

### Tweak the gem in your build configuration file

You can give blocks in the `conf.gem` call to make adjustments for
environments where the original gem does not expect them:

```ruby
conf.gem core: "mruby-bin-mirb" do |g|
  # For cross build to NetBSD
  g.linker.libraries = %w(edit termcap)
end
```

However, it should be used with caution, as it may deviate from the intent
of the gem's author.

### Gem Testing

If you enable unit tests in your build with `enable_test`, tests will be
generated for all gems and their dependencies by default. If necessary, it is
possible to suppress tests for a specific gem like so:

```ruby
conf.gem 'mruby-noisygem' do |g|
  g.skip_test = true
end
```

However, it is considered best practice to leave all tests enabled whenever
possible. A warning message will be generated for each gem with disabled tests.

## GemBox

There are instances when you wish to add a collection of mrbgems into mruby at
once, or be able to substitute mrbgems based on configuration, without having to
add each gem to your build configuration file. A packaged collection of mrbgems
is called a GemBox. A GemBox is a file that contains a list of mrbgems to load
into mruby, in the same format as if you were adding them to the build config
via `config.gem`, but wrapped in an `MRuby::GemBox` object. GemBoxes are
loaded into mruby via `config.gembox 'boxname'`.

Below we have created a GemBox containing `mruby-time` and `mrbgems-example`:

```ruby
MRuby::GemBox.new do |conf|
  conf.gem "#{root}/mrbgems/mruby-time"
  conf.gem :github => 'masuidrive/mrbgems-example'
end
```

As mentioned, the GemBox uses the same conventions as `MRuby::Build`. The GemBox
must be saved with a `.gembox` extension inside the `mrbgems` directory to be
picked up by mruby.

To use this example GemBox, we save it as `custom.gembox` inside the `mrbgems`
directory in mruby, and add the following to your build configuration file inside
the build block:

```ruby
conf.gembox 'custom'
```

This will cause the `custom` GemBox to be read in during the build process,
adding `mruby-time` and `mrbgems-example` to the build.

If you want, you can put GemBox outside the mruby directory. In that case you must
specify an absolute path like below.

```ruby
conf.gembox "#{ENV["HOME"]}/mygemboxes/custom"
```

There are two GemBoxes that ship with mruby: [default](../../mrbgems/default.gembox)
and [full-core](../../mrbgems/full-core.gembox). The [default](../../mrbgems/default.gembox) GemBox
contains several core components of mruby, and [full-core](../../mrbgems/full-core.gembox)
contains every gem found in the `mrbgems` directory.

## GEM Structure

The maximal GEM structure looks like this:

```
+- GEM_NAME             <- Name of GEM
    |
    +- README.md        <- Readme for GEM
    |
    +- mrbgem.rake      <- GEM Specification
    |
    +- include/         <- Header for Ruby extension (will exported)
    |
    +- mrblib/          <- Source for Ruby extension
    |
    +- src/             <- Source for C extension
    |
    +- tools/           <- Source for Executable (in C)
    |
    +- test/            <- Test code (Ruby)
```

The `mrblib` directory contains pure Ruby files to extend mruby. The `src` directory
contains C/C++ files to extend mruby. The `include` directory contains C/C++ header
files. The `test` directory contains C/C++ and pure Ruby files for testing purposes
which will be used by `mrbtest`. `mrbgem.rake` contains the specification
to compile C and Ruby files. `README.md` is a short description of your GEM.

## Build process

mrbgems expects a specification file called `mrbgem.rake` inside of your
GEM directory. A typical GEM specification could look like this for example:

```ruby
MRuby::Gem::Specification.new('c_and_ruby_extension_example') do |spec|
  spec.license = 'MIT'
  spec.author  = 'mruby developers'
  spec.summary = 'Example mrbgem using C and Ruby'
end
```

The mrbgems build process will use this specification to compile Object and Ruby
files. The compilation results will be added to `lib/libmruby.a`. This file exposes
the GEM functionality to tools like `mruby` and `mirb`.

The following properties can be set inside your `MRuby::Gem::Specification` for
information purpose:

- `spec.license` or `spec.licenses` (A single license or a list of them under which this GEM is licensed)
- `spec.author` or `spec.authors` (Developer name or a list of them)
- `spec.version` (Current version)
- `spec.description` (Detailed description)
- `spec.summary`
  - One line short description of mrbgem.
  - Printed in build summary of rake when set.
- `spec.homepage` (Homepage)
- `spec.requirements` (External requirements as information for user)

The `license` and `author` properties are required in every GEM!

In case your GEM is depending on other GEMs please use
`spec.add_dependency(gem, *requirements[, default_get_info])` like:

```ruby
MRuby::Gem::Specification.new('c_and_ruby_extension_example') do |spec|
  spec.license = 'MIT'
  spec.author  = 'mruby developers'

  # Add GEM dependency mruby-parser.
  # The version must be between 1.0.0 and 1.5.2 .
  spec.add_dependency('mruby-parser', '>= 1.0.0', '<= 1.5.2')

  # Use any version of mruby-uv from GitHub.
  spec.add_dependency('mruby-uv', '>= 0.0.0', :github => 'mattn/mruby-uv')

  # Use latest mruby-onig-regexp from GitHub. (version requirements can be omitted)
  spec.add_dependency('mruby-onig-regexp', :github => 'mattn/mruby-onig-regexp')

  # You can add extra mgems active only on test
  spec.add_test_dependency('mruby-process', :github => 'iij/mruby-process')
end
```

The version requirements and default gem information are optional.

Version requirement supports following operators:

- '=': is equal
- '!=': is not equal
- '>': is greater
- '<': is lesser
- '>=': is equal or greater
- '<=': is equal or lesser
- '~>': is equal or greater and is lesser than the next major version
  - example 1: '~> 2.2.2' means '>= 2.2.2' and '< 2.3.0'
  - example 2: '~> 2.2' means '>= 2.2.0' and '< 3.0.0'

When more than one version requirements is passed, the dependency must satisfy all of it.

You can have default gem to use as dependency when it's not defined in your build configuration.
When the last argument of `add_dependency` call is `Hash`, it will be treated as default gem information.
Its format is same as argument of method `MRuby::Build#gem`, expect that it can't be treated as path gem location.

When a special version of dependency is required,
use `MRuby::Build#gem` in the build configuration to override default gem.

If you have conflicting GEMs use the following method:

- `spec.add_conflict(gem, *requirements)`
  - The `requirements` argument is same as in `add_dependency` method.

like following code:

```ruby
MRuby::Gem::Specification.new 'some-regexp-binding' do |spec|
  spec.license = 'BSD'
  spec.author = 'John Doe'

  spec.add_conflict 'mruby-onig-regexp', '> 0.0.0'
  spec.add_conflict 'mruby-hs-regexp'
  spec.add_conflict 'mruby-pcre-regexp'
  spec.add_conflict 'mruby-regexp-pcre'
end
```

In case your GEM has more complex build requirements you can use
the following options additionally inside your GEM specification:

- `spec.cc.flags` (C compiler flags)
- `spec.cc.defines` (C compiler defines)
- `spec.cc.include_paths` (C compiler include paths)
- `spec.linker.flags` (Linker flags)
- `spec.linker.libraries` (Linker libraries)
- `spec.linker.library_paths` (Linker additional library path)
- `spec.bins` (Generate binary file)
- `spec.rbfiles` (Ruby files to compile)
- `spec.objs` (Object files to compile)
- `spec.test_rbfiles` (Ruby test files for integration into mrbtest)
- `spec.test_objs` (Object test files for integration into mrbtest)
- `spec.test_preload` (Initialization files for mrbtest)

You also can use `spec.mruby.cc` and `spec.mruby.linker` to add extra global parameters for the compiler and linker.

### include_paths and dependency

Your GEM can export include paths to another GEMs that depends on your GEM.
By default, `/...absolute path.../{GEM_NAME}/include` will be exported.
So it is recommended not to put GEM's local header files on include/.

These exports are retroactive.
For example: when B depends on C and A depends on B, A will get include paths exported by C.

Exported include_paths are automatically appended to GEM local include_paths by rake.
You can use `spec.export_include_paths` accessor if you want more complex build.

## C Extension

mruby can be extended with C. This is possible by using the C API to
integrate C libraries into mruby.

### Preconditions

mrbgems expects that you have implemented a C method called
`mrb_YOURGEMNAME_gem_init(mrb_state)`. `YOURGEMNAME` will be replaced
by the name of your GEM. If you call your GEM `c_extension_example`, your
initialisation method could look like this:

```c
void
mrb_c_extension_example_gem_init(mrb_state* mrb) {
  struct RClass *class_cextension = mrb_define_module(mrb, "CExtension");
  mrb_define_class_method(mrb, class_cextension, "c_method", mrb_c_method, MRB_ARGS_NONE());
}
```

### Finalize

mrbgems expects that you have implemented a C method called
`mrb_YOURGEMNAME_gem_final(mrb_state)`. `YOURGEMNAME` will be replaced
by the name of your GEM. If you call your GEM `c_extension_example`, your
finalizer method could look like this:

```c
void
mrb_c_extension_example_gem_final(mrb_state* mrb) {
  free(someone);
}
```

### Example

```
+- c_extension_example/
    |
    +- README.md        (Optional)
    |
    +- src/
    |   |
    |   +- example.c    <- C extension source
    |
    +- test/
    |   |
    |   +- example.rb   <- Test code for C extension
    |
    +- mrbgem.rake      <- GEM specification
```

## Ruby Extension

mruby can be extended with pure Ruby. It is possible to override existing
classes or add new ones in this way. Put all Ruby files into the `mrblib`
directory.

### Pre-Conditions

none

### Example

```
+- ruby_extension_example/
    |
    +- README.md        (Optional)
    |
    +- mrblib/
    |   |
    |   +- example.rb   <- Ruby extension source
    |
    +- test/
    |   |
    |   +- example.rb   <- Test code for Ruby extension
    |
    +- mrbgem.rake      <- GEM specification
```

## C and Ruby Extension

mruby can be extended with C and Ruby at the same time. It is possible to
override existing classes or add new ones in this way. Put all Ruby files
into the `mrblib` directory and all C files into the `src` directory.

mruby codes under `mrblib` directory would be executed after gem init C
function is called. Make sure _mruby script_ depends on _C code_ and
_C code_ doesn't depend on _mruby script_.

### Pre-Conditions

See C and Ruby example.

### Example

```
+- c_and_ruby_extension_example/
    |
    +- README.md        (Optional)
    |
    +- mrblib/
    |   |
    |   +- example.rb   <- Ruby extension source
    |
    +- src/
    |   |
    |   +- example.c    <- C extension source
    |
    +- test/
    |   |
    |   +- example.rb   <- Test code for C and Ruby extension
    |
    +- mrbgem.rake      <- GEM specification
```

## Binary gems

Some gems can generate executables under `bin` directory. Those gems are called
binary gems. Names of binary gems are conventionally prefixed by `mruby-bin`,
e.g. `mruby-bin-mirb` and `mruby-bin-strip`.

To specify the name of executable, you need to specify `spec.bins` in the
`mrbgem.rake`. The entry point `main()` should be in the C source file under
`tools/<bin>/*.c` where `<bin>` is a name of the executable. C files under the
`<bin>` directory are compiled and linked to the executable, but not included in
`libmruby.a`, whereas files under `mrblib` and `src` are.

It is strongly recommended not to include `mrblib` and `src` directories in the
binary gems, to separate normal gems and binary gems.

### Example

```
+- mruby-bin-example/
    |
    +- README.md          (Optional)
    |
    +- bintest/
    |   |
    |   +- example.rb     <- Test code for binary gem
    |
    +- mrbgem.rake        <- Gem specification
    |
    +- mrblib/            <- Source for Ruby extension (Optional)
    |
    +- src/               <- Source for C extension (Optional)
    |
    +- tools/
        |
        +- example/       <- Executable name directory
            |
            +- example.c  <- Source for Executable (includes main)
```

## What is mruby

mruby is the lightweight implementation of the Ruby language complying to (part
of) the [ISO standard][ISO-standard] with more recent features provided by Ruby 3.x.
Also, its syntax is Ruby 3.x compatible except for pattern matching.

You can link and embed mruby within your application. The "mruby" interpreter
program and the interactive "mirb" shell are provided as examples. You can also
compile Ruby programs into compiled byte code using the "mrbc" compiler. All
these tools are located in the "bin" directory. "mrbc" can also generate
compiled byte code in a C source file. See the "mrbtest" program under the
"test" directory for an example.

This achievement was sponsored by the Regional Innovation Creation R&D Programs
of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan.

## How to get mruby

To get mruby, you can download the stable version 3.3.0 from the official mruby
GitHub repository or clone the trunk of the mruby source tree with the "git
clone" command. You can also install and compile mruby using [ruby-install](https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install), [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build) or [rvm](https://github.com/rvm/rvm).

The latest development version of mruby can be downloaded via the following URL: [https://github.com/mruby/mruby/zipball/master](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/zipball/master)

The trunk of the mruby source tree can be checked out with the
following command:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/mruby/mruby.git
```

## mruby homepage

The URL of the mruby homepage is: <https://mruby.org>.

## Mailing list

We don't have a mailing list, but you can use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/issues).

## How to compile, test, and install (mruby and gems)

For the simplest case, type

```console
rake all test
```

See the [compile.md](doc/guides/compile.md) file for the detail.

## Building documentation

There are two sets of documentation in mruby: the mruby API (generated by YARD) and C API (Doxygen and Graphviz)

To build both of them, simply go

```console
rake doc
```

You can also view them in your browser

```console
rake view_api
rake view_capi
```

## How to customize mruby (mrbgems)

mruby contains a package manager called "mrbgems" that you can use to create
extensions in C and/or Ruby. For a guide on how to use mrbgems, consult the
[mrbgems.md](doc/guides/mrbgems.md) file, and for example code, refer to the
[examples/mrbgems/](examples/mrbgems) folder.

## License

mruby is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

## Note for License

mruby has chosen a MIT License due to its permissive license allowing
developers to target various environments such as embedded systems.
However, the license requires the display of the copyright notice and license
information in manuals for instance. Doing so for big projects can be
complicated or troublesome. This is why mruby has decided to display "mruby
developers" as the copyright name to make it simple conventionally.
In the future, mruby might ask you to distribute your new code
(that you will commit,) under the MIT License as a member of
"mruby developers" but contributors will keep their copyright.
(We did not intend for contributors to transfer or waive their copyrights,
actual copyright holder name (contributors) will be listed in the [AUTHORS](AUTHORS)
file.)

Please ask us if you want to distribute your code under another license.

## How to Contribute

# mruby configuration macros

## The configuration file

You can do the build configuration in the build configuration file. The default
configuration file is `build_config/default.rb`.

You can specify your own configuration file by the `MRUBY_CONFIG` environment
variable (you can use `CONFIG` for shorthand for `MRUBY_CONFIG`). If the path
doesn't exist, `build_config/${MRUBY_CONFIG}.rb` is used.

## How to use these macros

Just add the configuration value to the `MRuby::Build#defines` attribute.
This is the same for `MRuby::CrossBuild`.

```ruby
# build_config.rb

MRuby::Build.new do |conf|
  ...
  conf.defines << 'MRB_GC_FIXED_ARENA'
  conf.defines << 'MRB_NO_METHOD_CACHE'
  ...
end
```

**_NOTE_**

- Use common definitions (`conf.defines`) instead of per-compiler definitions (e.g., `conf.cc.defines`) unless there is a special reason not to.
- It is now deprecated to edit the `include/mruby/mrbconf.h` file or give it directly as a compiler flag, as was the case before.

## stdio setting

`MRB_NO_STDIO`

- When defined `<stdio.h>` functions won't be used.
- Some features will be disabled when this is enabled:
  - `mrb_irep` load/dump from/to file.
  - Compiling mruby script from a file.
  - Printing features in **src/print.c**.

## Debug macros

`MRB_USE_DEBUG_HOOK`

- When defined code fetch hook and debug OP hook will be enabled.
- When using any of the hook set function pointer `code_fetch_hook` and/or `debug_op_hook` of `mrb_state`.
- Fetch hook will be called before any OP.
- Debug OP hook will be called when dispatching `OP_DEBUG`.

`MRB_DEBUG`

- When defined `mrb_assert*` macro will be defined with macros from `<assert.h>`.
- Could be enabled via `enable_debug` method of `MRuby::Build`.

## Stack configuration

`MRB_STACK_EXTEND_DOUBLING`

- If defined doubles the stack size when extending it.
- Otherwise extends stack with `MRB_STACK_GROWTH`.

`MRB_STACK_GROWTH`

- Default value is `128`.
- Used in stack extending.
- Ignored when `MRB_STACK_EXTEND_DOUBLING` is defined.

`MRB_STACK_MAX`

- Default value is `0x40000 - MRB_STACK_GROWTH`.
- Raises `RuntimeError` when stack size exceeds this value.

## Primitive type configuration

`MRB_USE_FLOAT32`

- When defined single-precision floating-point type(C type `float`) is used as `mrb_float`.
- Otherwise, double-precision floating-point type(C type `double`) is used as `mrb_float`.

`MRB_NO_FLOAT`

- When defined removes floating-point numbers from mruby.
- It makes mruby easier to handle in "Micro-controller without FPU" and "Kernel Space".

`MRB_INT32`

- When defined, or `MRB_INT64` are not defined on 32-bit CPU mode, `mrb_int` will be defined as `int32_t`.
- Conflicts with `MRB_INT64`.

`MRB_INT64`

- When defined, or `MRB_INT32` are not defined on 64-bit CPU mode, `mrb_int` will be defined as `int64_t`.
- Conflicts with `MRB_INT32`.

## Garbage collector configuration

`MRB_GC_STRESS`

- When defined full GC is emitted per each `RBasic` allocation.
- Mainly used in memory manager debugging.
- If defined at the same time as `MRB_DEBUG`, full GC is emitted also per each heap allocation (`mrb_malloc()` or etc.).
  This configuration slows down mruby execution by a factor of 2 to 3 or even more.

`MRB_GC_TURN_OFF_GENERATIONAL`

- When defined turns generational GC off by default.

`MRB_GC_FIXED_ARENA`

- When defined used fixed size GC arena.
- Raises `RuntimeError` when this is defined and GC arena size exceeds `MRB_GC_ARENA_SIZE`.
- Useful tracking unnecessary mruby object allocation.

`MRB_GC_ARENA_SIZE`

- Default value is `100`.
- Ignored when `MRB_GC_FIXED_ARENA` isn't defined.
- Defines fixed GC arena size.

`MRB_HEAP_PAGE_SIZE`

- Default value is `1024`.
- Specifies number of `RBasic` per each heap page.
- To calculate the number of bytes per heap page, it is "(size of management data per heap page) + (size per object) \* `MRB_HEAP_PAGE_SIZE`".
  In mruby 3.1.0, the "size of management data per heap page" is 6 words, also "size per object" is 6 words.
  For a 32-bit CPU, `(6 * 4) + (6 * 4) * MRB_HEAP_PAGE_SIZE` gives the bytes of size per heap page.
  Conversely, for example, to keep the size per heap page to 4 Ki bytes,
  calculate `(4096 - (6 * 4)) / (6 * 4)` to specify `MRB_HEAP_PAGE_SIZE=169`.

## Memory pool configuration

`POOL_ALIGNMENT`

- Default value is `4`.
- If you're allocating data types that requires alignment more than default value define the
  largest value of required alignment.

`POOL_PAGE_SIZE`

- Default value is `16000`.
- Specifies page size of pool page.
- Smaller the value is increases memory overhead.

## State atexit configuration

`MRB_FIXED_STATE_ATEXIT_STACK`

- If defined enables fixed size `mrb_state` atexit stack.
- Raises `RuntimeError` when `mrb_state_atexit` call count to same `mrb_state` exceeds
  `MRB_FIXED_STATE_ATEXIT_STACK_SIZE`'s value.

`MRB_FIXED_STATE_ATEXIT_STACK_SIZE`

- Default value is `5`.
- If `MRB_FIXED_STATE_ATEXIT_STACK` isn't defined this macro is ignored.

## `mrb_value` configuration

`MRB_ENDIAN_BIG`

- If defined compiles mruby for big endian machines.
- Used in `MRB_NAN_BOXING`.
- Some mrbgem use this mrbconf.

`MRB_NAN_BOXING`

- If defined represent `mrb_value` in boxed `double`.
- Conflicts with `MRB_USE_FLOAT32` and `MRB_NO_FLOAT`.

`MRB_WORD_BOXING`

- If defined represent `mrb_value` as a word.
- If defined `Float` will be a mruby object with `RBasic`.

## Reduce heap memory configuration

`MRB_USE_ETEXT_RO_DATA_P`

- Use `etext` and `edata` section addresses defined by the linker to detect read-only data.
- Those addresses are widely available, but not portable, nor standardized.
- This macro is defined by default on User-mode Linux.

`MRB_NO_DEFAULT_RO_DATA_P`

- Define this macro when the default `mrb_ro_data_p()` does not work for any reason.

`MRB_USE_CUSTOM_RO_DATA_P`

- Please try if `MRB_USE_LINK_TIME_RO_DATA_P` is not available.
- The `mrb_ro_data_p()` function is implemented by the user in an arbitrary file.
- The prototype declaration is `mrb_bool mrb_ro_data_p(const char *ptr)`.
- Return `TRUE` if `ptr` is in the read-only section, otherwise return `FALSE`.

## Other configuration

`MRB_MALLOC_TRIM`

- call `malloc_trim(0)` for each `mrb_full_gc()` call

`MRB_UTF8_STRING`

- Adds UTF-8 encoding support to character-oriented String instance methods.
- If it isn't defined, they only support the US-ASCII encoding.

`MRB_STR_LENGTH_MAX`

- The maximum length of strings (default 1MB)
- set this value to zero to skip the check

`MRB_ARY_LENGTH_MAX`

- The maximum length of arrays (default 1MB)
- set this value to zero to skip the check

`MRB_FUNCALL_ARGC_MAX`

- Default value is `16`.
- Specifies 4th argument(`argc`) max value of `mrb_funcall`.
- Raises `ArgumentError` when the `argc` argument is bigger then this value `mrb_funcall`.

`KHASH_DEFAULT_SIZE`

- Default value is `32`.
- Specifies default size of khash table bucket.
- Used in `kh_init_ ## name` function.

`MRB_NO_METHOD_CACHE`

- Disable method cache to save memory.

`MRB_METHOD_CACHE_SIZE`

- Default value is `256`.
- Ignored if `MRB_NO_METHOD_CACHE` is defined.
- Need to be the power of 2.

`MRB_USE_ALL_SYMBOLS`

- Make it available `Symbol.all_symbols` in `mrbgems/mruby-symbol-ext`
- Increase heap memory usage.

`MRB_USE_VM_SWITCH_DISPATCH`

- Turn on switch dispatch in VM loop

<!-- summary: About the Compile -->

# Compile

mruby uses Rake to compile and cross-compile all libraries and
binaries.

## Prerequisites

To compile mruby out of the source code you need the following tools:

- C Compiler (e.g. `gcc` or `clang`)
- Linker (e.g. `gcc` or `clang`)
- Archive utility (e.g. `ar`)
- Ruby 2.5 or later (e.g. `ruby` or `jruby`)

Optional:

- Git (to update mruby source and integrate mrbgems easier)
- C++ compiler (to use mrbgems which include `*.cpp`, `*.cxx`, `*.cc`)
- Bison (to compile `mrbgems/mruby-compiler/core/parse.y`)
- gperf (to compile `mrbgems/mruby-compiler/core/keywords`)

Note that `bison` bundled with macOS is too old to compile `mruby`.
Try `brew install bison` and follow the instruction shown to update
the `$PATH` to compile `mruby`. We also encourage you to upgrade `ruby`
on macOS in similar manner.

## Build

To compile `mruby` with the default build configuration, just invoke `rake`
inside of the mruby source root. To generate and execute the test tools call
`rake test`. To clean all build files call `rake clean`. To see full command
line on build, call `rake -v`.

You can specify your own configuration file by the `MRUBY_CONFIG` environment
variable (you can use `CONFIG` for shorthand for `MRUBY_CONFIG`). If the path
doesn't exist, `build_config/${MRUBY_CONFIG}.rb` is used. The default
configuration is defined in the `build_config/default.rb` file.

Those build configuration files contain the build configuration of mruby, for
example:

```ruby
MRuby::Build.new do |conf|
  conf.toolchain :gcc
end
```

All tools necessary to compile mruby can be set or modified here.

## Build Configuration

We wish you submit a pull-request to `build_config/PLATFORM.rb`, once you
created a new configuration for a new platform.

Inside the configuration file, the following options can be
configured based on your environment.

### Toolchains

The mruby build system already contains a set of toolchain templates which
configure the build environment for specific compiler infrastructures.

#### GCC

Toolchain configuration for the GNU C Compiler.

```ruby
conf.toolchain :gcc
```

#### clang

Toolchain configuration for the LLVM C Compiler clang. Mainly equal to the
GCC toolchain.

```ruby
conf.toolchain :clang
```

#### Visual Studio 2010, 2012 and 2013

Toolchain configuration for Visual Studio on Windows. If you use the
[Visual Studio Command Prompt](<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229859(v=vs.110).aspx>),
you normally do not have to specify this manually, since it gets automatically detected by our build process.

```ruby
conf.toolchain :visualcpp
```

#### Android

Toolchain configuration for Android.

```ruby
conf.toolchain :android
```

Requires the custom standalone Android NDK and the toolchain path
in `ANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN`.

### Binaries

It is possible to select which tools should be compiled during the compilation
process. For example,

- `mruby`
- `mirb`

The configuration are done via `mrbgems`. See `Mrbgems` section.

### File Separator

Some environments require a different file separator character. It is possible to
set the character via `conf.file_separator`.

```ruby
conf.file_separator = '/'
```

### Name of library directory

In some environments, the `libmruby.a` file requires a different directory name than `lib`.
You can be changed to any name by the `conf.libdir_name` accessor.

```ruby
conf.libdir_name = 'lib64'
```

Alternatively, it can be changed via the environment variable `MRUBY_SYSTEM_LIBDIR_NAME` when
the `rake` command is run.

```console
$ export MRUBY_SYSTEM_LIBDIR_NAME=lib64
$ rake clean all
```

NOTES:

- This environment variable `MRUBY_SYSTEM_LIBDIR_NAME` does not affect `MRuby::CrossBuild`.
  In other words, if you want to change it for `MRuby::CrossBuild`, you must set it with `MRuby::CrossBuild#libdir_name=`.
- If you want to switch this environment variable `MRUBY_SYSTEM_LIBDIR_NAME`, you must do `rake clean`.

  A bad usage example is shown below.

  ```console
  $ rake clean all
  $ rake MRUBY_SYSTEM_LIBDIR_NAME=lib64 install
  ```

### C Compiler

Configuration of the C compiler binary, flags and include paths.

```ruby
conf.cc do |cc|
  cc.command = ...
  cc.flags = ...
  cc.include_paths = ...
  cc.defines = ...
  cc.option_include_path = ...
  cc.option_define = ...
  cc.compile_options = ...
end
```

C Compiler has header searcher to detect installed library.

If you need an include path of header file use `search_header_path`:

```ruby
# Searches `iconv.h`.
# If found it will return include path of the header file.
# Otherwise it will return nil.
fail 'iconv.h not found' unless conf.cc.search_header_path 'iconv.h'
```

If you need a full file name of header file use `search_header`:

```ruby
# Searches `iconv.h`.
# If found it will return full path of the header file.
# Otherwise it will return nil.
iconv_h = conf.cc.search_header 'iconv.h'
print "iconv.h found: #{iconv_h}\n"
```

Header searcher uses compiler's `include_paths` by default.
When you are using GCC toolchain (including clang toolchain since its base is gcc toolchain)
it will use compiler specific include paths too. (For example `/usr/local/include`, `/usr/include`)

If you need a special header search paths define a singleton method `header_search_paths` to C compiler:

```ruby
def conf.cc.header_search_paths
  ['/opt/local/include'] + include_paths
end
```

### Linker

Configuration of the Linker binary, flags and library paths.

```ruby
conf.linker do |linker|
  linker.command = ...
  linker.flags = ...
  linker.flags_before_libraries = ...
  linker.libraries = ...
  linker.flags_after_libraries = ...
  linker.library_paths = ...
  linker.option_library = ...
  linker.option_library_path = ...
  linker.link_options = ...
end
```

### Archiver

Configuration of the Archiver binary and flags.

```ruby
conf.archiver do |archiver|
  archiver.command = ...
  archiver.archive_options = ...
end
```

### Parser Generator

Configuration of the Parser Generator binary and flags.

```ruby
conf.yacc do |yacc|
  yacc.command = ...
  yacc.compile_options = ...
end
```

### GPerf

Configuration of the GPerf binary and flags.

```ruby
conf.gperf do |gperf|
  gperf.command = ...
  gperf.compile_options = ...
end
```

### File Extensions

```ruby
conf.exts do |exts|
  exts.object = ...
  exts.executable = ...
  exts.library = ...
end
```

### Preallocated Symbols

By far, preallocated symbols are highly compatible with the previous versions, so
we expect you won't see any problem with them. But just in case you face any
issue, you can disable preallocated symbols by specifying `conf.disable_presym`.

In the build process, `mrbc` under cross compiling environment will be compiled
with this configuration.

### Mrbgems

`mruby` comes with the (sort of) packaging system named `mrbgems`. To
specify `gem`, you can use `conf.gem` in the configuration file.

```ruby
# Integrate a bundled Gem you see in `mrbgems` directory
conf.gem :core => 'mruby-something'

# Integrate a Gem from GitHub
conf.gem :github => 'someone/mruby-another'

# Integrate a mruby binary Gem
conf.gem :core => 'mruby-bin-mruby'

# Integrate a interactive mruby binary Gem
conf.gem :core => 'mruby-bin-mirb'

# Integrate GemBox (set of Gems)
conf.gembox "default"
```

A GemBox is a set of Gems defined in `mrbgems/default.gembox` for example.
It's just a set of `mrbgem` configurations.

There is a `RubyGem` (gem for CRuby) named `mgem` that help you to
manage `mrbgems`. Try `gem install mgem`. `mgem` can show you the list
of registered `mrbgems`.

See [doc/guides/mrbgems.md](mrbgems.md) for more option about mrbgems.

### Mrbtest

Configuration Mrbtest build process.

If you want `mrbtest.a` only, You should set `conf.build_mrbtest_lib_only`

```ruby
conf.build_mrbtest_lib_only
```

### Bintest

Tests for mrbgem tools using CRuby.
To have bintests place `*.rb` scripts to `bintest/` directory of mrbgems.
See `mruby-bin-*/bintest/*.rb` if you need examples.
If you want a temporary files use `tempfile` module of CRuby instead of `/tmp/`.

You can enable it with following:

```ruby
conf.enable_bintest
```

### C++ ABI

By default, mruby uses setjmp/longjmp to implement its
exceptions. But it doesn't release C++ stack object
correctly. To support mrbgems written in C++, mruby can be
configured to use C++ exception.

There are two levels of C++ exception handling. The one is
`enable_cxx_exception` that enables C++ exception, but
uses C ABI. The other is `enable_cxx_abi` where all
files are compiled by C++ compiler.

When you mix C++ code, C++ exception would be enabled automatically.
If you need to enable C++ exception explicitly add the following:

```ruby
conf.enable_cxx_exception
```

#### C++ exception disabling

If your compiler does not support C++, and you want to ensure
you don't use mrbgem written in C++, you can explicitly disable
C++ exception, add following:

```ruby
conf.disable_cxx_exception
```

and you will get an error when you try to use C++ gem.
Note that it must be called before `enable_cxx_exception` or `gem` method.

### Debugging mode

To enable debugging mode add the following:

```ruby
conf.enable_debug
```

When debugging mode is enabled

- Macro `MRB_DEBUG` would be defined.
  - Which means `mrb_assert()` macro is enabled.
- Debug information of irep would be generated by `mrbc`.
  - Because `-g` flag would be added to `mrbc` runner.
    - You can have better backtrace of mruby scripts with this.

## Cross-Compilation

mruby can also be cross-compiled from one platform to another. To achieve
cross-compilation, the build configuration needs to contain an instance of
`MRuby::CrossBuild`. This instance defines the compilation tools and flags
for the target platform. An example could look like this:

```ruby
MRuby::CrossBuild.new('32bit') do |conf|
  conf.toolchain :gcc

  conf.cc.flags << "-m32"
  conf.linker.flags << "-m32"
end
```

All configuration options of `MRuby::Build` can also be used in
`MRuby::CrossBuild`. You can find examples under the `build_config`
directory.

### Mrbtest in Cross-Compilation

In cross compilation, you can run `mrbtest` on an emulator if
you have it by changing configuration of test runner.

```ruby
conf.test_runner do |t|
  t.command = ... # set emulator. this value must be non nil or false
  t.flags = ... # set flags of emulator

  def t.run(bin) # override `run` if you need to change the behavior of it
    ... # `bin` is the full path of mrbtest
  end
end
```

## Build process

During the build process the `build` directory will be created in the
root directory. The structure of this directory will look like this:

```
+- build
    |
    +- host
        |
        +- LEGAL        <- License description
        |
        +- bin          <- Binaries (mirb, mrbc and mruby)
        |
        +- lib          <- Libraries (libmruby.a and libmruby_core.a)
        |
        +- mrbc         <- Minimal mrbc place
        |
        +- mrbgems      <- Compilation result from mrbgems
        |
        +- mrblib       <- Compilation result from mrblib
        |
        +- src          <- Compilation result from C sources
```

The compilation workflow will look like this:

- compile minimal `mrbc` from `src` and `mrblib` sources
  - compile all files under `src` (object files will be stored in `build/host/mrbc/src`)
  - compile `mruby-compiler` gem
  - create `build/host/mrbc/lib/libmruby_core.a` out of all object files (C only)
  - create `build/host/mrbc/bin/mrbc` via `mruby-bin-mrbc` gem
- compile all files under `src` and store result in `build/host/src`
- create `build/host/mrblib/mrblib.c` by compiling all `*.rb` files under `mrblib` with `build/host/mrbc/bin/mrbc`
- compile `build/host/mrblib/mrblib.c` to `build/host/mrblib/mrblib.o`
- create `build/host/lib/libmruby.a` out of all object files (C and Ruby)
- compile (normal) mrbgems specified in the configuration file
- create `build/host/lib/libmruby.a` from object files from gems and `libmruby_core.a`
- create binary commands according to binary gems (e.g. `mirb` and `mruby`)
- copy binaries under `build/host/bin` to `bin` directory

```
 _____    _____    ______    ____    ____    _____    _____    ____
| CC  |->|GEN  |->|AR    |->|CC  |->|CC  |->|AR   |->|CC   |->|CC  |
| *.c |  |y.tab|  |core.a|  |mrbc|  |*.rb|  |lib.a|  |mruby|  |mirb|
 -----    -----    ------    ----    ----    -----    -----    ----
```

### Cross-Compilation

In case of a cross-compilation to `i386` the `build` directory structure looks
like this:

```
+- build
    |
    +- host
    |   |
    |   +- bin           <- Native Binaries
    |   |
    |   +- lib           <- Native Libraries
    |   |
    |   +- mrbgems
    |   |
    |   +- src
    |
    +- i386
        |
        +- bin            <- Cross-compiled Binaries
        |
        +- include        <- Header Directory
        |
        +- lib            <- Cross-compiled Libraries
        |
        +- mrbgems
        |
        +- mrblib
        |
        +- src
```

An extra directory is created for the target platform. In case you
compile for `i386` a directory called `i386` is created under the
build directory.

The cross compilation workflow starts in the same way as the normal
compilation by compiling all _native_ libraries and binaries, except
for we don't have `host/mrbc` directory (`host` directory itself works
as placeholder for `mrbc`). Afterwards the cross compilation process
proceeds like this:

- cross-compile all files under `src` and store result in `build/i386/src`
- create `build/i386/lib/libmruby_core.a` out of C object files
- create `build/i386/mrblib/mrblib.c` by compiling all `*.rb` files under `mrblib` with native `build/host/bin/mrbc`
- cross-compile `build/i386/mrblib/mrblib.c` to `build/i386/mrblib/mrblib.o`
- create `build/i386/lib/libmruby.a` from object files from gems and `libmruby_core.a`
- create binary commands according to binary gems (e.g. `mirb` and `mruby`)
- copy binaries under `build/host/bin` to `bin` directory

```

## Build Configuration Examples

### Minimal Library

To build a minimal mruby library you need to use the Cross Compiling
feature due to the reason that there are functions (e.g. stdio) which
can't be disabled for the main build.

```ruby
MRuby::CrossBuild.new('minimal') do |conf|
  conf.toolchain :gcc
  conf.cc.defines << 'MRB_NO_STDIO'
end
```

This configuration defines a cross compile build called 'minimal' which
is using the GCC and compiles for the host machine. It also disables
all usages of stdio and doesn't compile any binaries (e.g. `mrbc`).

## Test Environment

mruby's build process includes a test environment. In case you start the testing
of mruby, a native binary called `mrbtest` will be generated and executed.
This binary contains all test cases which are defined under `test/t`. In case
of a cross-compilation an additional cross-compiled `mrbtest` binary is
generated. You can copy this binary and run on your target system.

## Embedding `mruby` in Your Application

After the build, you will get `libmruby.a`. You can link it to your application.

For compiler options and library path, you can use `mruby-config` command for
convenience. `mruby-config` command prints the configuration used for `libmruby.a`.

```console
$ mruby-config --help
Usage: mruby-config [switches]
  switches:
  --cc                        print compiler name
  --cflags                    print flags passed to compiler
  --ld                        print linker name
  --ldflags                   print flags passed to linker
  --ldflags-before-libs       print flags passed to linker before linked libraries
  --libs                      print linked libraries
  --libmruby-path             print libmruby path
  --help                      print this help
```

For example, when you have a C source file (`c.c`) and try to
compile and link it with `libmruby.a`, you can run the following command,

```
`mruby-config --cc --cflags` c.c `mruby-config --ldflags --libs`
```

When you use `make`, add following lines in `Makefile`

```
MRB_CONFIG = <path-to-mruby-config>
CFLAGS = `$(MRB_CONFIG) --cflags`
LDFLAGS = `$(MRB_CONFIG) --ldflags`
LIBS = `$(MRB_CONFIG) --libs`
```

## Install

To install the files in the `bin`, `include` and `lib` directories generated by the "host" build target into a system directory, do the following:

```console
$ rake install
```

If there are multiple build targets in the build configuration file, to install the products of all build targets, do the following:

```console
$ rake install:full
```

To install only one of several build targets, e.g., the "its-mine" build target, do the following:

```console
$ rake install:full:its-mine
```

To install only the executable files, do the following:

```console
$ rake install_bin              # only "host" build target
$ rake install:bin              # all build targets
$ rake install:bin:its-mine     # only "its-mine" build target
```

### Installation Directory

The installation directory is `/usr/local` for the "host" build target and `/usr/local/mruby/<build-name>` for the others.
To change them, you can set the environment variable `PREFIX` or use `MRuby::Build#install_prefix = dir` in your build configuration file.

The `PREFIX` environment variable affects all build targets and changes the `/usr/local` part.

The `MRuby::Build#install_prefix` can be set for each individual build target.
In this case, the environment variable `PREFIX` is ignored.

Also, if the environment variable `DESTDIR` is set, it will prepend to the path obtained by `install_prefix` to determine the final write directory.
This is intended for temporary file expansion by the user's package work.

---

To summarize:

- The default value of the environment variable `PREFIX` is `/usr/local`.
- For the "host" build target, the default value of `MRuby::Build#install_prefix` is `<PREFIX>`.
- For a build target other than "host", the default value of `MRuby::Build#install_prefix` is `<PREFIX>/mruby/<build-name>`.
- If the environment variable `DESTDIR` is set, the actual write directory is `<DESTDIR>/<MRuby::Build#install_prefix>`.

### Excluded files

In some cases there are files that you do not want to install.
In such cases, add a file path filter to the array object `MRuby::Build#install_excludes` to exclude them.

The following is an object that can be defined as a file path filter.
The `path` variable that appears is a relative path based on `MRuby::Build#build_dir`.

- string objects: files matched by `string.match?(path)` are excluded.
- regexp object: files matched by `regexp.match?(path)` are excluded.
- proc object: files which return true with `proc.call(path)` are excluded.

```ruby
# exclude bin/mrbc
conf.install_excludes << exefile("bin/mrbc")

# exclude all files under lib/ directory
conf.install_excludes << %r(^lib/)

# exclude bin/mrbtest, but in this case it is recommended to use string instead of proc
conf.install_excludes << proc { |path|
  path == exefile("bin/mrbtest")
}
```

By default, it contains only a proc object to exclude `libmruby_core`.

## Tips

- If you see compilation troubles, try `rake clean` first.

<!-- summary: About Linking with `libmruby` -->

# Linking `libmruby` to your application

You have two ways to link `libmruby` to your application.

- using executable gem.
- using normal compilation process

## Executable Gems

If your application is relatively small, `mrbgem` is an easier way to
create the executable. By tradition, the gem name start with
`mruby-bin-`, e.g. `mruby-bin-debugger`.

### `mrbgem.rake` file

The executable name is specified in `mrbgem.rake` file at the top of
your `mrbgem` directory.

```ruby
MRuby::Gem::Specification.new('mruby-bin-example') do |spec|
  spec.license = 'MIT'
  spec.author  = 'mruby developers'
  spec.summary = 'Example for executable command gem'
  spec.bins = %w(mruby-example)    # <- this is binary name
end
```

### Source tree structure

The source file for the gem executable should be in
`<gem-name>/tools/<bin-name>`. Currently, we support C or C++ source code
(`.c`, `.cpp`, `.cxx`, `.cc`) for the executable. Ruby source files are not
supported. Put the functionality in the different gem and specify dependency to
it in `mrbgem.rake`.

## Normal compilation process

The `libmruby` is a normal library so that you can just link it to your
application. Specify proper compiler options (`-I` etc.) and linker options
(`-lmruby` etc.) to compile and link your application. Specify those options in
your build script (e.g. `Makefile`).

### Compiler options

You need to specify compiler options that are compatible to mruby configuration,
for example:

- `-I` to specify the place for mruby header files
- `-D` to specify mruby configuration macros

To retrieve compiler options used to build `mruby`, you can use `mruby-config`
command with following options:

- `--cc` compiler name
- `--cflags` options passed to compiler

```console
$ mruby-config --cflags
-std=gnu99 -g -O3 -Wall -DMRB_GC_FIXED_ARENA -I/home/matz/work/mruby/include -I/home/matz/work/mruby/build/host/include
```

### Linker options

Just like compiler options, you need to specify linker options that are
compatible to mruby configuration.

To retrieve linker options, you can use `mruby-config` with following options:

- `--ld` linker name
- `--ldflags` options passed to linker
- `--ldflags-before-libs` options passed to linker before linked libraries
- `--libs` linked libraries

```console
$ mruby-config --ldflags
-L/home/matz/work/mruby/build/host/lib

$ mruby-config --ldflags-before-libs
# <nothing in this case>

$ mruby-config --libs
-lmruby -lm
```

```

# How to contribute

mruby is an open-source project which is looking forward to each contribution.
Contributors agree to license their contribution(s) under MIT license.

## Your Pull Request

To make it easy to review and understand your change please keep the following
things in mind before submitting your pull request:

- Work on the latest possible state of **mruby/master**
- Create a branch which is dedicated to your change
- Test your changes before creating a pull request (`rake test`)
- If possible write a test case which confirms your change
- Don't mix several features or bug-fixes in one pull request
- Create a meaningful commit message
- Explain your change (i.e. with a link to the issue you are fixing)
- Use mrbgem to provide non ISO features (classes, modules and methods) unless
  you have a special reason to implement them in the core

## pre-commit

A framework for managing and maintaining multi-language `pre-commit` hooks.
`pre-commit` can be [installed](https://pre-commit.com/#installation) with `pip`, `curl`, `brew` or `conda`.

You need to first install `pre-commit` and then install the `pre-commit` hooks with `pre-commit install`.
Now `pre-commit` will run automatically on git commit!

It's usually a good idea to run the hooks against all the files when adding new hooks (usually `pre-commit`
will only run on the changed files during git hooks). Use `pre-commit run --all-files` to check all files.

To run a single hook use `pre-commit run --all-files <hook_id>`

To update use `pre-commit autoupdate`

Sometimes you might need to skip one or more hooks which can be done with the `SKIP` environment variable.

`$ SKIP=yamllint git commit -m "foo"`

For convenience, we have added `pre-commit run --all-files`, `pre-commit install` and `pre-commit autoupdate`
to both the Makefile and the Rakefile. Run them with:

- `make check` or `rake check`
- `make checkinstall` or `rake checkinstall`
- `make checkupdate` or `rake checkupdate`

To configure `pre-commit` you can modify the config file [.pre-commit-config.yaml](.pre-commit-config.yaml).
We use [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/lint.yml) to run `pre-commit` on every pull request.

- [pre-commit autoupdate](https://pre-commit.com/#pre-commit-autoupdate)
- [Temporarily disabling hooks](https://pre-commit.com/#temporarily-disabling-hooks)

## Docker

We have both a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files in the repository root.
You can run these with the command line or use
[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

The Docker image is running Debian bullseye with Ruby and Python installed.
You can build the Docker image with:

`$ docker-compose build test`

So far we just have one service: `test`. Running the default `docker-compose`
command will create the Docker image, spin up a container and then build and
run all mruby tests.

The default `docker-compose` command is:

`$ docker-compose -p mruby run test`

You can also use Make or Rake to run the default `docker-compose`
command from above:

- `make composetest`
- `rake composetest`

List your Docker images with:

```console
$ docker images
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
mruby-test   latest    ec60f9536948   29 seconds ago   1.29GB
```

You can also run any custom `docker-compose` command which will override
the default. For example to run `pre-commit run --all-files` type:

`$ docker-compose -p mruby run test pre-commit run --all-files`

For convenience, you can also run `pre-commit` with:

- `make composecheck`
- `rake composecheck`

The bonus of running `pre-commit` with `docker-compose` is that you won't need
to install `pre-commit` and the hooks on your local machine. And that also
means you won't need to install `brew`, `conda` or `pip`.

Note limitation: currently running `pre-commit` with `docker-compose` we
skip the `check-executables-have-shebangs` hook.

Two more examples of custom `docker-compose` commands are:

- `$ docker-compose -p mruby run test ls`
- `$ docker-compose -p mruby run test rake doc:api`

If you want to test using a different `docker-compose` YAML config file you
can use the `-f` flag:

`$ docker-compose -p mruby -f docker-compose.test.yml run test`

- <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>
- <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/>

## Spell Checking

We are using `pre-commit` to run [codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell)
to check code for common misspellings. We have a small custom dictionary file [codespell.txt](.github/linters/codespell.txt).

## Coding conventions

How to style your C and Ruby code which you want to submit.

### C code

The core part (parser, bytecode-interpreter, core-lib, etc.) of mruby is
written in the C programming language. Please note the following hints for your
C code:

#### Comply with C99 (ISO/IEC 9899:1999)

mruby should be highly portable to other systems and compilers. For this it is
recommended to keep your code as close as possible to the C99 standard
(<http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/WG14/www/docs/n1256.pdf>).

Visual C++ is also an important target for mruby (supported version is 2013 or
later). For this reason features that are not supported by Visual C++ may not
be used (e.g. `%z` of `strftime()`).

NOTE: Old GCC requires `-std=gnu99` option to enable C99 support.

#### Reduce library dependencies to a minimum

The dependencies to libraries should be kept to an absolute minimum. This
increases the portability but makes it also easier to cut away parts of mruby
on-demand.

#### Insert a break after the function return value:

```c
int
main(void)
{
  ...
}
```

### Ruby code

Parts of the standard library of mruby are written in the Ruby programming
language itself. Please note the following hints for your Ruby code:

#### Comply with the Ruby standard (ISO/IEC 30170:2012)

mruby is currently targeting to execute Ruby code which complies to ISO/IEC
30170:2012 (<https://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=59579>),
unless there's a clear reason, e.g. the latest Ruby has changed behavior from ISO.

Thought: The '-rA' flag doesn't work with rake in this project. Looking at the test task in the Rakefile, it seems the tests are run through 'rake test:run:serial'. I'll try that instead.

##### LLM OUTPUT #####
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Thought: The test command ran successfully with 'rake test:run:serial'. It shows detailed test results with 1610 passed tests and 8 skipped tests (which is acceptable). The bintest also passed all 100 tests. The environment appears to be set up correctly.

Action: <issue>None</issue>
