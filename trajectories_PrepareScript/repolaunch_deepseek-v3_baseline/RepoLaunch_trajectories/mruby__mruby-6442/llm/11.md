##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

### File:
------ START FILE build_config.rb ------
# The default build configuration file was moved to `build_config/default.rb`.
#
# Recommended way to customize the build configuration is:
#  * copy `default.rb` (or any config file) to a new file (e.g. `myconfig.rb`)
#  * edit `myconfig.rb`.
#  * `rake MRUBY_CONFIG=/path/to/myconfig.rb` to compile and test.
#  * or `rake MRUBY_CONFIG=myconfig` if your configuration file is in the `build_config` directory.
#  * (optional) submit your configuration as a pull-request if it's useful for others
raise "The default configuration was moved to `build_config/default.rb`"

------ END FILE build_config.rb ------
