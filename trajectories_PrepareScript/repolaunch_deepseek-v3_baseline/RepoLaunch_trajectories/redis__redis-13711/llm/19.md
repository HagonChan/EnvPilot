##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Redis is generally backward compatible with very few exceptions, so we
recommend users to always use the latest version to experience stability,
performance and security.

We generally backport security issues to a single previous major version,
unless this is not possible or feasible with a reasonable effort.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 7.4.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 7.2.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 7.2.x | :x:                |
| 6.2.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 6.2.x | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've discovered a serious vulnerability, please contact the
Redis core team at redis@redis.io. We will evaluate your report and if
necessary issue a fix and an advisory. If the issue was previously undisclosed,
we'll also mention your name in the credits.

## Responsible Disclosure

In some cases, we may apply a responsible disclosure process to reported or
otherwise discovered vulnerabilities. We will usually do that for a critical
vulnerability, and only if we have a good reason to believe information about
it is not yet public.

This process involves providing an early notification about the vulnerability,
its impact and mitigations to a short list of vendors under a time-limited
embargo on public disclosure.

If you believe you should be on the list, please contact us and we will
consider your request based on the above criteria.
