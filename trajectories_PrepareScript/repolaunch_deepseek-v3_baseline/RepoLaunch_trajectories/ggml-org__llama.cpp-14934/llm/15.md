##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

BLIS Installation Manual
------------------------

BLIS is a portable software framework for high-performance BLAS-like dense linear algebra libraries. It has received awards and recognition, including the 2023 James H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software and the 2020 SIAM Activity Group on Supercomputing Best Paper Prize. BLIS provides a new BLAS-like API and a compatibility layer for traditional BLAS routine calls. It offers features such as object-based API, typed API, BLAS and CBLAS compatibility layers.

Project URL: https://github.com/flame/blis

### Prepare:

Compile BLIS:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flame/blis
cd blis
./configure --enable-cblas -t openmp,pthreads auto
# will install to /usr/local/ by default.
make -j
```

Install BLIS:

```bash
sudo make install
```

We recommend using openmp since it's easier to modify the cores being used.

### llama.cpp compilation

CMake:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DGGML_BLAS=ON -DGGML_BLAS_VENDOR=FLAME ..
make -j
```

### llama.cpp execution

According to the BLIS documentation, we could set the following
environment variables to modify the behavior of openmp:

```bash
export GOMP_CPU_AFFINITY="0-19"
export BLIS_NUM_THREADS=14
```

And then run the binaries as normal.
