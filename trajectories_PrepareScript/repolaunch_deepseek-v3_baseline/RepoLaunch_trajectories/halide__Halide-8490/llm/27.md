##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to install dependencies and set up a environment that is able to run the tests of the project.

- You start with an initial Docker container based on ubuntu:22.04.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- No need to clone the project again.

The final objective is to successfully run the tests of the project.


### Generic Instructions:
- Examine the project structure to understand the build system
- Look for common files like:
  - Makefile, CMakeLists.txt (C/C++)
  - configure, autogen.sh (autotools)
  - setup.py, pyproject.toml, requirements.txt (Python)
  - package.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml (Node.js)
  - Cargo.toml (Rust)
  - pom.xml, build.gradle (Java)
  - go.mod (Go)
  - *.csproj, *.sln (C#)
- Install necessary build tools and dependencies
- Follow the project's README, INSTALL, or BUILD instructions if available
- Try common commands like 'make', 'cmake', './configure', etc.
- Install system dependencies through package manager (apt, yum, apk, etc.)


================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

    Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
        <command>bash command</command>
        e.g. install build-essential: <command>apt-get install -y build-essential</command>
        e.g. view file content: <command>cat README.md</command>
    Search: search the web for if you need some information, generate query and reply with following format:
        <search>the search query</search>
        e.g. <search>how to fix 'No module named setuptools'</search>
        e.g. <search>how to install python3 on ubuntu</search>
        e.g. <search>how to create development environment for python3</search>
    Stop: stop the setup loop once you think the setup is complete, reply with following format:
        <stop></stop>
    

Observation will be the result of running those actions.

Halide provides Python bindings for most of its public API. Python 3.8 (or
higher) is required. The Python bindings are supported on 64-bit Linux, OSX, and
Windows systems.

In addition to the ability to write just-in-time Halide code using Python, you
can write [Generators](#halide-generators-in-python) using the Python bindings,
which can simplify build-system integration (since no C++ metacompilation step
is required).

You can also use existing Halide Generators (written in either C++ or Python)
to produce Python extensions that can be used within Python code.

## Acquiring the Python bindings

As of Halide 19.0.0, we provide binary wheels on PyPI which include the Python
bindings and the C++/CMake package for native development. Full releases may be
installed with `pip` like so:

```shell
$ pip install halide
```

Every commit to `main` is published to Test PyPI as a development version and
these may be installed with a few extra flags:

```shell
$ pip install halide --pre --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple
```

Currently, we provide wheels for: Windows x86-64, macOS x86-64, macOS arm64, and
Linux x86-64. The Linux wheels are built for manylinux_2_28, which makes them
broadly compatible (Debian 10, Ubuntu 18.10, Fedora 29).

## Building the Python bindings

If `pip` isn't enough for your purposes, or you are developing Halide directly,
you have two options for building and using the Python bindings. Note that the
bindings require Halide to be built with RTTI and exceptions **enabled**, which
in turn requires LLVM to be built with RTTI, but this is not the default for
LLVM.

### Using CMake directly

Before configuring with CMake, you should ensure you have prerequisite packages
installed in your local Python environment. The best way to get set up is to use
a virtual environment:

```shell
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
$ python3 -m pip install -U pip "setuptools[core]" wheel
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then build and install Halide:

```shell
$ cmake -G Ninja -S . -B build \
        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \ 
        -DWITH_PYTHON_BINDINGS=ON
$ cmake --build build
$ cmake --install build --prefix .local
```

Now you can set the `PYTHONPATH` variable to point to the freshly built Python
package:

```shell
$ export PYTHONPATH="$PWD/.local/lib/python3/site-packages"
```

### Using wheel infrastructure

You can also follow the same procedure that we use to build the published
wheels. First, create a virtual environment as before, but omit
`requirements.txt`

```shell
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
$ python3 -m pip install -U pip "setuptools[core]" wheel
```

Next, ensure you have installed Halide's dependencies to locations where CMake
can find them, given your environment. The variables `Halide_LLVM_ROOT`,
`flatbuffers_ROOT`, and `wabt_ROOT` specify locations for the relevant packages
directly. If they are all installed to a common prefix, you can add it to the
environment variable `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`.

Then it should be as simple as:

```shell
$ pip install .
```

## Documentation and Examples

As mentioned elsewhere, the Python API attempts to mimic the
[C++ Halide API](http://halide-lang.org/docs) as directly as possible; there
isn't separate Python-specific documentation for the API at this time.

For now, examine the code for the example applications in the `test/apps/` and
`tutorial/` subdirectories.

The tests run as part of the standard CTest infrastructure and are labeled with
the `python` label. You can run the Python tests specifically by running:

```
$ ctest -L python
```

from the Halide build directory.

## Differences from C++ API

The Python bindings attempt to mimic the Halide C++ API as closely as possible,
with some differences where the C++ idiom is either inappropriate or impossible:

- Most APIs that take a variadic argument list of ints in C++ take an explicit
  list in Python. For instance, the usual version of the `Buffer` ctor in C++
  offers both variadic and list versions:

  ```cpp
  Buffer<>(Type t, int extent_dim_0, int extent_dim_1, ...., extent_dim_N, string name = "");
  Buffer<>(Type t, vector<int> extents, string name = "");
  ```

  In Python, only the second variant is provided.

- `Func` and `Buffer` access is done using `[]` rather than `()`

  - For zero-dimensional `Func` and `Buffer`, you must explicitly specify
    `[()]` -- that is, use an empty tuple as the index -- because `[]` is not
    syntactically acceptable in Python.

- Some classes in the Halide API aren't provided because standard Python idioms
  are a better fit:

  - `Halide::Tuple` doesn't exist in the Python bindings; an ordinary Python
    tuple of `Halide::Expr` is used instead.
  - `Halide::Realization` doesn't exist in the Python bindings; an ordinary
    Python tuple of `Halide::Buffer` is used instead.

- static and instance method overloads with the same name in the same class
  aren't allowed, so some convenience methods are missing from `Halide::Var`

- Templated types (notably `Halide::Buffer<>` and `Halide::Param<>`) aren't
  provided, for obvious reasons; only the equivalents of
  `Halide::Buffer<void>` and `Halide::Param<void>` are supported.

- The functions in `Halide::ConciseCasts` are present in the toplevel Halide
  module in Python, rather than a submodule: e.g., use `halide.i8_sat()`, not
  `halide.ConciseCasts.i8_sat()`.

- Only things in the `Halide` namespace are supported; classes and methods that
  involve using the `Halide::Internal` namespace are not provided.

- No mechanism is provided for overriding any runtime functions from Python for
  JIT-compiled code. (Runtime functions for AOT-compiled code can be overridden
  by building and linking a custom runtime, but not currently via any runtime
  API, e.g. halide_set_custom_print() does not exist.)

- No mechanism is provided for supporting `Func::define_extern`.

- `Buffer::for_each_value()` isn't supported yet.

- `Func::in` becomes `Func.in_` because `in` is a Python keyword.

- `Func::async` becomes `Func.async_` because `async` is a Python keyword.

- The `not` keyword cannot be used to negate boolean Halide expressions.
  Instead, the `logical_not` function can be used and is equivalent to using
  `operator!` in C++.

- There is no way to override the logical `and`/`or` operators in Python to work
  with `Expr`: you must use the bitwise `|` and `&` instead. (Note that
  incorrectly using `and`/`or` just short-circuits weirdly, rather than failing
  with some helpful error; this is an issue that we have not yet found any way
  to improve, unfortunately.)

- Some error messages need to be made more informative.

- Some exceptions are the "incorrect" type (compared to C++ expectations).

- Many hooks to override runtime functions (e.g. Func::set_error_handler)
  aren't yet implemented.

- The following parts of the Halide public API are currently missing entirely
  from the Python bindings (but are all likely to be supported at some point in
  the future):

  - `DeviceInterface`
  - `evaluate()`

## Example of Simple Usage

Here is a basic example of using Halide to produce a procedural image.

```python
# By convention, we import halide as 'hl' for terseness
import halide as hl

# Some constants
edge = 512
k = 20.0 / float(edge)

# Simple formula
x, y, c = hl.Var('x'), hl.Var('y'), hl.Var('c')
f = hl.Func('f')
e = hl.sin(x * ((c + 1) / 3.0) * k) * hl.cos(y * ((c + 1) / 3.0) * k)
f[x, y, c] = hl.cast(hl.UInt(8), e * 255.0)
f.vectorize(x, 8).parallel(y)

# Realize into a Buffer.
buf = f.realize([edge, edge, 3])

# Do something with the image. We'll just save it to a PNG.
from halide import imageio

imageio.imwrite("/tmp/example.png", buf)
```

It's worth noting in the example above that the Halide `Buffer` object supports
the Python Buffer Protocol (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3118) and thus
is converted to and from other compatible objects (e.g., NumPy's `ndarray`), at
essentially zero cost, with storage being shared. Thus, we can usually pass it
directly to existing Python APIs (like `imsave()`) that expect 'image-like'
objects without any explicit conversion necessary.

## Halide Generators In Python

In Halide, a "Generator" is a unit of encapsulation for Halide code. It is a
self-contained piece of code that can:

- Produce a chunk of Halide IR (in the form of an `hl.Pipeline`) that is
  appropriate for compilation (via either JIT or AOT)
- Expose itself to the build system in a discoverable way
- Fully describe itself for the build system with metadata for (at least) the
  type and number of inputs and outputs expected
- Allow for build-time customization of coder-specified parameters in a way that
  doesn't require editing of source code

Originally, Halide only supported writing Generators in C++. In this document,
we'll use the term "C++ Generator" to mean "Generator written in C++ using the
classic API", the term "Python Generator" to mean "Generator written in Halide's
Python bindings", and just plain "Generator" when the discussion is relatively
neutral with respect to the implementation language/API.

### Writing a Generator in Python

A Python Generator is a class that:

- has the `@hl.generator` decorator applied to it
- declares zero or more member fields that are initialized with values of
  `hl.InputBuffer` or `hl.InputScalar`, which specify the expected input(s) of
  the resulting `Pipeline`.
- declares one or more member fields that are initialized with values of
  `hl.OutputBuffer` or `hl.OutputScalar`, which specify the expected output(s)
  of the resulting `Pipeline`.
- declares zero or more member fields that are initialized with values of
  `hl.GeneratorParam`, which can be used to pass arbitrary information from the
  build system to the Generator. A GeneratorParam can carry a value of type
  `bool`, `int`, `float`, `str`, or `hl.Type`.
- declares a `generate()` method that fill in the Halide IR needed to define all
  the Outputs
- optionally declares a `configure()` method to dynamically add Inputs or
  Outputs to the pipeline, based on (e.g.) the values of `GeneratorParam`
  values or other external inputs

Let's look at a fairly simple example:

> **TODO:** this example is pretty contrived; is there an equally simple
> Generator to use here that would demonstrate the basics?

```python
import halide as hl

x = hl.Var('x')
y = hl.Var('y')

_operators = {
    'xor': lambda a, b: a ^ b,
    'and': lambda a, b: a & b,
    'or': lambda a, b: a | b
}


# Apply a mask value to a 2D image using a logical operator that is selected at compile-time.
@hl.generator(name="logical_op_generator")
class LogicalOpGenerator:
    op = hl.GeneratorParam("xor")

    input = hl.InputBuffer(hl.UInt(8), 2)
    mask = hl.InputScalar(hl.UInt(8))

    output = hl.OutputBuffer(hl.UInt(8), 2)

    def generate(g):
        # Algorithm
        operator = _operators[g.op]
        g.output[x, y] = operator(g.input[x, y], g.mask)

        # Schedule
        v = g.natural_vector_size(hl.UInt(8))
        g.output.vectorize(x, v)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    hl.main()
```

If you've worked with Halide Generators written in C++, the "shape" of this will
likely look familiar. (If not, no worries; you shouldn't need any knowledge of
C++ Generators for the following to make sense.)

Let's take the details here one at a time.

#### `hl.generator("name")`

This decorator adds appropriate "glue" machinery to the class to enforce various
invariants. It also serves as the declares a "registered name" for the
Generator, which is a unique name that the build system will use to identify the
Generator. If you omit the name, it defaults to `module.classname`; if module is
`__main__` then we omit it and just use the plain classname. Note that the
registered name need not match the classname. (Inside Halide, we use the
convention of `CamelCase` for class names and `snake_case` for registered names,
but you can use whatever convention you like.)

#### hl.GeneratorParam

Each `GeneratorParam` is an arbitrary key-value pair that can be used to provide
configurable options at compile time. You provide the name and a default value.
The default value can be overridden by the build machinery, which will replace
the value (based on user specified text).

Note that the type of the default value *is* used to define the expected type of
the `GeneratorParam`, and trying to set it to an incompatible value will throw
an exception. The types that are acceptable to use in a `GeneratorParam` are:

- Python's `bool`, `int`, `float`, or `str`
- Halide's `hl.Type`
- ...that's all

Note that the value of a `GeneratorParam` is read-only from the point of view of
the Generator; they are set at Generator construction time and attempting to
change their value will throw an exception.

#### hl.InputBuffer, hl.InputScalar

These declare the inputs to the `hl.Pipeline` that the Generator will produce.
An `hl.InputScalar` is, essentially, a "factory" that produces an `hl.Param` in
the existing Python API, while an `hl.InputBuffer` is a factory for
`hl.ImageParam`.

From the Generator author's perspective, a field initialized with `InputScalar`
**is** a `Param` – not kinda-like-one, not a magic wrapper that forwards
everything; it is literally just `hl.Param`. Similarly, an `InputBuffer`
produces `ImageParam`, and an `InputFunc` is a wrapper around `Func`. You won't
be able to assign a new value to the member field for Inputs – as with
GeneratorParams, they are "read-only" to the Generator – but you will be able to
set constraints on them.

Note that in addition to specifying a concrete type and dimensionality for the
inputs, these factory classes support the ability to specify either (or both)
`None`, which means the type/dimensionality will be provided by GeneratorParams
in the build system.

#### hl.OutputBuffer, hl.OutputScalar

These declare the output(s) of the Pipeline that the Generator will produce. An
`hl.OutputBuffer` is, essentially, a "factory" that produces an `hl.Func` in the
existing Python API. (`hl.OutputScalar` is just an `hl.OutputBuffer` that always
has zero dimensions.)

From the Generator author's perspective, a field declared with `OutputBuffer`
**is** a `Func` – not kinda-like-one, not a magic wrapper that forwards
everything; it is literally just `hl.Func` (with type-and-dimensionality set to
match, see recent PR https://github.com/halide/Halide/pull/6734) . You won't be
able to assign a new value to the member field for Inputs – as with
GeneratorParams, they are "read-only" to the Generator – but you will be able to
set constraints on them.

Note that in addition to specifying a concrete type and dimensionality for the
inputs, these factory classes support the ability to specify either (or both) as
`None`, which means the type/dimensionality will be provided by GeneratorParams
in the build system.

#### Names

Note that all the GeneratorParams, Inputs, and Outputs have names that are
implicitly filled in based on the field name of their initial assignment; unlike
in C++ Generators, there isn't a way to "override" this name (i.e., the name in
the IR will always exactly match the Python field name). Names have the same
constraints as for C++ Generators (essentially, a C identifier, but without an
initial underscore, and without any double underscore anywhere).

#### generate() method

This will be called by the Generator machinery to build the Pipeline. As with
C++ Generators, the only required task is to ensure that all Output fields are
fully defined, in a way that matches the type-and-dimension constraints
specified.

It is required that the `generate()` method be defined by the Generator.

(Note that, by convention, Halide Generators use `g` instead of `self` in their
`generate()` method to make the expression language terser; this is not in any
way required, but is recommended to improve readability.)

#### Types for Inputs and Outputs

For all the Input and Output fields of Generators, you can specify native Python
types (instead of `hl.Type`) for certain cases that are unambiguous. At present,
we allow `bool` as an alias for `hl.Bool()`, `int` as an alias for
`hl.Int(32)`, and `float` as an alias for `hl.Float(32)`.

### Using a Generator for JIT compilation

You can use the `compile_to_callable()` method to JIT-compile a Generator into a
`hl.Callable`, which is (essentially) just a dynamically-created function.

```python
import LogicalOpGenerator
from halide import imageio
import numpy as np

# Instantiate a Generator -- we can only set the GeneratorParams
# by passing in a dict to the Generator's constructor
or_op_generator = LogicalOpGenerator({"op": "or"})

# Now compile the Generator into a Callable
or_filter = or_op_generator.compile_to_callable()

# Read in some file for input
input_buf = imageio.imread("/path/to/some/file.png")
assert input_buf.ndim == 2
assert input_buf.dtype == np.uint8

# create a Buffer-compatible object for the output; we'll use np.array
output_buf = np.empty(input_buf.shape, dtype=input_buf.dtype)

# Note, Python code throws exception for error conditions rather than returning an int
or_filter(input_buf, 0x7f, output_buf)

# Note also that we can use named arguments for any/all, in the Python manner:
or_filter(mask=0x7f, input=input_buf, output=output_buf)

imageio.imwrite("/tmp/or.png", output_buf)
```

By default, a Generator will produce code targeted at `Target("host")` (or the
value of the `HL_JIT_TARGET` environment variable, if set); you can override
this behavior selectively by activating a `GeneratorContext` when the Generator
is *created*:

```python
import LogicalOpGenerator

# Compile with debugging enabled
t = hl.Target("host-debug")
with hl.GeneratorContext(t):
    or_op_generator = LogicalOpGenerator({"op": "or"})
    or_filter = or_op_generator.compile_to_callable()
```

### Using a Generator for AOT compilation

If you are using CMake, the simplest thing is to use
`add_halide_library` and `add_halide_python_extension_library()`:

```cmake
# Build a Halide library as you usually would, but be sure to include `PYTHON_EXTENSION`
add_halide_library(xor_filter
                   FROM logical_op_generator
                   PARAMS op=xor
                   PYTHON_EXTENSION output_path_var
                   [ FEATURES ... ]
                   [ PARAMS ... ])

# Now wrap the generated code with a Python extension.
# (Note that module name defaults to match the target name; we only
# need to specify MODULE_NAME if we need a name that may differ)
add_halide_python_extension_library(my_extension
                                    MODULE_NAME my_module
                                    HALIDE_LIBRARIES xor_filter)
```

(Note that this rule works for both C++ and Python Generators.)

This compiles the Generator code in `logical_op_generator.py` with the
registered name `logical_op_generator` to produce the target `xor_filter`, and
then wraps the compiled output with a Python extension. The result will be a
shared library of the form `<target>.<soabi>.so`, where `<soabi>` describes 
the specific Python version and platform (e.g., `cpython-310-darwin` for 
Python 3.10 on OSX.)

Note that you can combine multiple Halide libraries into a single Python module;
this is convenient for packaging, but also because all the libraries in a single
extension module share the same Halide runtime (and thus, the same caches,
thread pools, etc.).

```cmake
add_halide_library(xor_filter ...)
add_halide_library(and_filter ...)
add_halide_library(or_filter ...)

add_halide_python_extension_library(my_extension
                                    MODULE_NAME my_module
                                    HALIDE_LIBRARIES xor_filter and_filter or_filter)
```

Note that you must take care to ensure that all of the `add_halide_library`
targets specified use the same Halide runtime; it may be necessary to use
`add_halide_runtime`
to define an explicit runtime that is shared by all the targets:

```cmake
add_halide_runtime(my_runtime)

add_halide_library(xor_filter USE_RUNTIME my_runtime ...)
add_halide_library(and_filter USE_RUNTIME my_runtime ...)
add_halide_library(or_filter USE_RUNTIME my_runtime ...)

add_halide_python_extension_library(my_extension
                                    MODULE_NAME my_module
                                    HALIDE_LIBRARIES xor_filter and_filter or_filter)
```

If you're not using CMake, you can "drive" a Generator directly from your build
system via command-line flags. The most common, minimal set looks something like
this:

```shell
python3 /path/to/my/generator.py -g <registered-name> \
                                 -o <output-dir> \
                                 target=<halide-target-string> \
                                 [generator-param=value ...]
```

The argument to `-g` is the name supplied to the `@hl.generator` decorator. The
argument to -o is a directory to use for the output files; by default, we'll
produce a static library containing the object code, and a C++ header file with
a forward declaration. `target` specifies a Halide `Target` string describing
the OS, architecture, features, etc. that should be used for compilation. Any
other arguments to the command line that don't begin with `-` are presumed to
name
`GeneratorParam` values to set.

There are other flags and options too, of course; use `python3
/path/to/my/generator.py -help` to see a list with explanations.

(Unfortunately, there isn't (yet) a way to produce a Python Extension just by
running a Generator; the logic for `add_halide_python_extension_library` is
currently all in the CMake helper files.)

### Calling Generator-Produced code from Python

As long as the shared library is in `PYTHONPATH`, it can be imported and used
directly. For the example above:

```python
from my_module import xor_filter
from halide import imageio
import numpy as np

# Read in some file for input
input_buf = imageio.imread("/path/to/some/file.png")
assert input_buf.ndim == 2
assert input_buf.dtype == np.uint8

# create a Buffer-compatible object for the output; we'll use np.array
output_buf = np.empty(input_buf.shape, dtype=input_buf.dtype)

# Note, Python code throws exception for error conditions rather than returning an int
xor_filter(input_buf, 0xff, output_buf)

# Note also that we can use named arguments for any/all, in the Python manner:
# xor_filter(input=input_buf, mask=0xff, output=output_buf)

imageio.imwrite("/tmp/xored.png", output_buf)
```

Above, we're using common Python utilities (`numpy`) to construct the
input/output buffers we want to pass to Halide.

**Note**: Getting the memory order correct can be a little confusing for numpy.
By default, numpy uses "C-style"
[row-major](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/internals.html)
order, which sounds like the right option for Halide; however, this nomenclature
assumes the matrix-math convention of ordering axes as `[rows, cols]`, whereas
Halide (and imaging code in general) generally assumes `[x, y]` (i.e., `[cols,
rows]`). Thus, what you usually want in Halide is column-major ordering. This
means numpy arrays, by default, come with the wrong memory layout for Halide.
But if you construct the numpy arrays yourself (like above), you can pass
`order='F'` to make numpy use the Halide-compatible memory layout. If you're
passing in an array constructed somewhere else, the easiest thing to do is to
`.transpose()` it before passing it to your Halide code.

### Advanced Generator-Related Topics

#### Generator Aliases

A Generator alias is a way to associate a Generator with one (or more) specific
sets of GeneratorParams; the 'alias' is just another registered name. This
offers a convenient alternative to specifying multiple sets of GeneratorParams
via the build system. To define alias(es) for a Generator, just add the
`@hl.alias` decorator before `@hl.generator` decorator:

```python
@hl.alias(
    xor_generator={"op": "xor"},
    and_generator={"op": "and"},
    or_generator={"op": "or"}
)
@hl.generator("logical_op_generator")
class LogicalOpGenerator:
    ...
```

#### Dynamic Inputs and Outputs

If you need to build `Input` and/or `Output` dynamically, you can define a
`configure()` method. It will always be called after all `GeneratorParam` values
are valid, but before `generate()` is called. Let's take our example and add an
option to pass an offset to be added after the logical operator is done:

```python
import halide as hl

x = hl.Var('x')
y = hl.Var('y')

_operators = {
    'xor': lambda a, b: a ^ b,
    'and': lambda a, b: a & b,
    'or': lambda a, b: a | b
}


# Apply a mask value to a 2D image using a logical operator that is selected at compile-time.
@hl.generator(name="logical_op_generator")
class LogicalOpGenerator:
    op = hl.GeneratorParam("xor")
    with_offset = hl.GeneratorParam(False)

    input = hl.InputBuffer(hl.UInt(8), 2)
    mask = hl.InputScalar(hl.UInt(8))

    output = hl.OutputBuffer(hl.UInt(8), 2)

    def configure(g):
        # If with_offset is specified, we
        if g.with_offset:
            g.add_input("offset", hl.InputScalar(hl.Int(32)))

    # See note the use of 'g' instead of 'self' here
    def generate(g):
        # Algorithm
        operator = _operators[g.op]
        if hasattr(g, "offset"):
            g.output[x, y] = operator(g.input[x, y], g.mask) + g.offset
        else:
            g.output[x, y] = operator(g.input[x, y], g.mask)

        # Schedule
        v = g.natural_vector_size(hl.UInt(8))
        g.output.vectorize(x, v)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    hl.main()
```

The only thing you can (usefully) do from `configure()` is to call `add_input()`
or `add_output()`, which accept only the appropriate `Input` or `Output`
classes. The resulting value is stored as a member variable with the name
specified (if there is already a member with the given name, an exception is
thrown).

#### Calling a Generator Directly

Each Generator has a class method (injected by `@hl.generator`) that allows you
to "call" the Generator like an ordinary function; this allows you to directly
take the Halide IR produced by the Generator and do anything you want to with
it. This can be especially useful when writing library code, as you can
'compose' more complex pipelines this way.

This method is named `call()` and looks like this:

```python
@classmethod
def call(cls, *args, **kwargs):
    ...
```

It takes the inputs (specified either by-name or by-position in the usual Python
way). It also allows for an optional by-name-only argument, `generator_params`,
which is a simple Python dict that allows for overriding `GeneratorParam`s. It
returns a tuple of the Output values. For the earlier example, usage might be
something like:

```python
import LogicalOpFilter

x, y = hl.Var(), hl.Var()

input_buf = hl.Buffer(hl.UInt(8), [2, 2])
mask_value = 0x7f

# Inputs by-position
func_out = LogicalOpFilter.call(input_buf, mask_value)

# Inputs by-name
func_out = LogicalOpFilter.call(mask=mask_value, input=input_buf)

# Above again, but with generator_params
func_out = LogicalOpFilter.call(input_buf, mask_value,
                                generator_params={"op": "and"})
func_out = LogicalOpFilter.call(generator_params={"op": "and"},
                                input=input_buf, mask=mask_value)
```

#### The Lifecycle Of A Generator

Whether being driven by a build system (for AOT use) or by another piece of
Python code (typically for JIT use), the lifecycle of a Generator looks
something like this:

- An instance of the Generator in question is created. It uses the
  currently-active `GeneratorContext` (which contains the `Target` to be used
  for code generation), which is stored in a thread-local stack.
- Some (or all) of the default values of the `GeneratorParam` members may be
  replaced based on (e.g.) command-line arguments in the build system
- All `GeneratorParam` members are made immutable.
- The `configure()` method is called, allowing the Generator to use
  `add_input()`

# Halide

Halide is a programming language designed to make it easier to write
high-performance image and array processing code on modern machines. Halide
currently targets:

- CPU architectures: X86, ARM, Hexagon, PowerPC, RISC-V
- Operating systems: Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Qualcomm QuRT
- GPU Compute APIs: CUDA, OpenCL, Apple Metal, Microsoft Direct X 12, Vulkan

Rather than being a standalone programming language, Halide is embedded in C++.
This means you write C++ code that builds an in-memory representation of a
Halide pipeline using Halide's C++ API. You can then compile this representation
to an object file, or JIT-compile it and run it in the same process. Halide also
provides a Python binding that provides full support for writing Halide embedded
in Python without C++.

Halide requires C++17 (or later) to use.

For more detail about what Halide is, see https://halide-lang.org.

For API documentation see https://halide-lang.org/docs.

For some example code, read through the tutorials online
at https://halide-lang.org/tutorials. The corresponding code is in the
`tutorials/` directory. Larger examples are in the `apps/` directory.

If you've acquired a full source distribution and want to build Halide, see the
[notes below](#building-halide).

# Getting Halide

## Pip

As of Halide 19.0.0, we provide binary wheels on PyPI. Halide provides bindings
for C++ and Python. Even if you only intend to use Halide from C++, pip may be
the easiest way to get a binary build of Halide.

Full releases may be installed with `pip` like so:

```shell
$ pip install halide
```

Every commit to `main` is published to Test PyPI as a development version and
these may be installed with a few extra flags:

```shell
$ pip install halide --pre --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple
```

Currently, we provide wheels for: Windows x86-64, macOS x86-64, macOS arm64, and
Linux x86-64. The Linux wheels are built for manylinux_2_28, which makes them
broadly compatible (Debian 10, Ubuntu 18.10, Fedora 29).

*For C++ usage of the pip package:* On Linux and macOS, CMake's `find_package`
command should find Halide as long as you're in the same virtual environment you
installed it in. On Windows, you will need to add the virtual environment root
directory to `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`. This can be done by running
`set CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=%VIRTUAL_ENV%` in `cmd`.

Other build systems can find the Halide root path by running `python -c 
"import halide; print(halide.install_dir())"`.

## Homebrew

Alternatively, if you use macOS, you can install Halide via
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) like so:

```
$ brew install halide
```

## Binary tarballs

The latest version of Halide can always be found on GitHub
at https://github.com/halide/Halide/releases

We provide binary releases for many popular platforms and architectures,
including 32/64-bit x86 Windows, 64-bit x86/ARM macOS, and 32/64-bit x86/ARM
Ubuntu Linux.

The macOS releases are built using XCode's command-line tools with Apple Clang
500.2.76. This means that we link against libc++ instead of libstdc++. You may
need to adjust compiler options accordingly if you're using an older XCode which
does not default to libc++.

We use a recent Ubuntu LTS to build the Linux releases; if your distribution is
too old, it might not have the requisite glibc. 

Nightly builds of Halide and the LLVM versions we use in CI are also available
at https://buildbot.halide-lang.org/

## Vcpkg

If you use [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to manage dependencies,
you can install Halide via:

```
$ vcpkg install halide:x64-windows # or x64-linux/x64-osx
```

One caveat: vcpkg installs only the minimum Halide backends required to compile
code for the active platform. If you want to include all the backends, you
should install `halide[target-all]:x64-windows` instead. Note that since this
will build LLVM, it will take a _lot_ of disk space (up to 100GB).

## Other package managers

We are interested in bringing Halide to other popular package managers and Linux
distribution repositories! We tra....stripped due to length....
 anything goes wrong, switch to the CMake build. Note also that the Makefile
> cannot build the Python bindings or produce install packages.

*TL;DR*: Have LLVM 17 (or greater) installed and run `make` in the root
directory of the repository (where this README is).

By default, `make` will use the `llvm-config` tool found in the `PATH`. If you
want to use a different LLVM, such as a custom-built one following the
instructions above, set the following environment variable:

```shell
$ export LLVM_CONFIG="$LLVM_ROOT/bin/llvm-config"
```

Now you should be able to just run `make` in the root directory of the Halide
source tree. `make run_tests` will run the JIT test suite, and `make test_apps`
will make sure all the apps compile and run (but won't check their output).

When building the tests, you can set the AOT compilation target with the 
`HL_TARGET` environment variable.

### Building Halide out-of-tree with make

If you wish to build Halide in a separate directory, you can do that like so:

```shell
$ cd ..
$ mkdir halide_build
$ cd halide_build
$ make -f ../Halide/Makefile
```

# Some useful environment variables

`HL_JIT_TARGET=...` will set Halide's JIT compilation target.

`HL_DEBUG_CODEGEN=1` will print out pseudocode for what Halide is compiling.
Higher numbers will print more detail.

`HL_NUM_THREADS=...` specifies the number of threads to create for the thread
pool. When the async scheduling directive is used, more threads than this number
may be required and thus allocated. A maximum of 256 threads is allowed. (By
default, the number of cores on the host is used.)

`HL_TRACE_FILE=...` specifies a binary target file to dump tracing data into
(ignored unless at least one `trace_` feature is enabled in the target). The
output can be parsed programmatically by starting from the code in
`utils/HalideTraceViz.cpp`.

Thought: The README provides comprehensive instructions for building Halide. Since we're interested in running tests, I should follow the CMake build instructions since they're more robust and can build Python bindings. The documentation suggests running tests with `ctest -L python` after building.

Thought: The build failed because it couldn't find LLVM, which is a required dependency for Halide. According to the README, Halide requires LLVM 17 or greater. I need to install LLVM 17 before proceeding with the build.

Action: <command>apt-get install -y llvm-17 llvm-17-dev clang-17</command>
