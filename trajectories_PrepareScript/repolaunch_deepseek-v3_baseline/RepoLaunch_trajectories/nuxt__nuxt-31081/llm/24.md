##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to install dependencies and set up a environment that is able to run the tests of the project.

- You start with an initial Docker container based on ubuntu:22.04.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- No need to clone the project again.

The final objective is to successfully run the tests of the project.


### TypeScript-Specific Instructions:
- Use npm, yarn, or pnpm to install dependencies (check package.json and lockfiles)
- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies
- Check package.json for test scripts and build commands
- Consider using `npm ci` for faster, reproducible builds if package-lock.json exists
- Install TypeScript globally if needed (e.g., `npm install -g typescript`)


================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

    Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
        <command>bash command</command>
        e.g. install build-essential: <command>apt-get install -y build-essential</command>
        e.g. view file content: <command>cat README.md</command>
    Search: search the web for if you need some information, generate query and reply with following format:
        <search>the search query</search>
        e.g. <search>how to fix 'No module named setuptools'</search>
        e.g. <search>how to install python3 on ubuntu</search>
        e.g. <search>how to create development environment for python3</search>
    Stop: stop the setup loop once you think the setup is complete, reply with following format:
        <stop></stop>
    

Observation will be the result of running those actions.


Project Structure: the structure of the project, including files and directories.
Related Files: the content of related files of the project that may help you understand the project.
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: <command>your bash command here</command> or <search>your search query</search> or other actions available
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) ...
Thought: I think the setup should be fine
Action: <stop>stop the setup</stop>
Answer: the final result

description: Some specific points about contributions to the framework repository.
---

Once you've read the [general contribution guide](/docs/community/contribution), here are some specific points to make about contributions to the [`nuxt/nuxt`](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt) repository.

## Monorepo Guide

- `packages/kit`: Toolkit for authoring Nuxt Modules, published as [`@nuxt/kit`](https://npmjs.com/package/@nuxt/kit).
- `packages/nuxt`: The core of Nuxt, published as [`nuxt`](https://npmjs.com/package/nuxt).
- `packages/schema`: Cross-version Nuxt typedefs and defaults, published as [`@nuxt/schema`](https://npmjs.com/package/@nuxt/schema).
- `packages/test-utils`: Test utilities for Nuxt, published as [`@nuxt/test-utils`](https://npmjs.com/package/@nuxt/test-utils).
- `packages/vite`: The [Vite](https://vite.dev) bundler for Nuxt, published as [`@nuxt/vite-builder`](https://npmjs.com/package/@nuxt/vite-builder).
- `packages/webpack`: The [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) bundler for Nuxt 3, published as [`@nuxt/webpack-builder`](https://npmjs.com/package/@nuxt/webpack-builder).

## Setup

To contribute to Nuxt, you need to set up a local environment.

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the [`nuxt/nuxt`](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt)  repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository) it to your local device.
2. Ensure using the latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (20.x)
3. Enable [Corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) to have `pnpm` and `yarn`
    ```bash [Terminal]
    corepack enable
    ```
4. Run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` to Install the dependencies with pnpm:
    ```bash [Terminal]
    pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
    ```
    ::note
    If you are adding a dependency, please use `pnpm add`. :br
    The `pnpm-lock.yaml` file is the source of truth for all Nuxt dependencies.
    ::
5. Activate the passive development system
    ```bash [Terminal]
    pnpm dev:prepare
    ```
6. Check out a branch where you can work and commit your changes:
    ```bash [Terminal]
    git checkout -b my-new-branch
    ```

Then, test your changes against the [playground](#playground) and [test](#testing) your changes before submitting a pull request.

### Playground

While working on a pull request, you will likely want to check if your changes are working correctly.

You can modify the example app in `playground/`, and run:

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm dev
```

::important
Please make sure not to commit it to your branch, but it could be helpful to add some example code to your PR description. This can help reviewers and other Nuxt users understand the feature you've built in-depth.
::

### Testing

Every new feature should have a corresponding unit test (if possible). The `test/` directory in this repository is currently a work in progress, but do your best to create a new test following the example of what's already there.

Before creating a PR or marking it as ready-to-review, ensure that all tests pass by running:

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm test
```

### Linting

You might have noticed already that we use ESLint to enforce a coding standard.

Before committing your changes, to verify that the code style is correct, run:

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm lint
```

::note
You can use `pnpm lint --fix` to fix most of the style changes. :br
If there are still errors left, you must correct them manually.
::

### Documentation

If you are adding a new feature or refactoring or changing the behavior of Nuxt in any other manner, you'll likely want to document the changes. Please include any changes to the docs in the same PR. You don't have to write documentation up on the first commit (but please do so as soon as your pull request is mature enough).

::important
Make sure to make changes according to the [Documentation Style Guide](/docs/community/contribution#documentation-style-guide).
::

### Final Checklist

When submitting your PR, there is a simple template that you have to fill out. Please tick all appropriate "answers" in the checklists.

## Documentation Guide

If you spot an area where we can improve documentation or error messages, please do open a PR - even if it's just to fix a typo!

::important
Make sure to make changes according to the [Documentation Style Guide](/docs/community/contribution#documentation-style-guide).
::

### Quick Edits

If you spot a typo or want to rephrase a sentence, you can click on the **Edit this page** link located on the right aside in the **Community** section.

Make the change directly in the GitHub interface and open a Pull Request.

### Longer Edits

The documentation content is inside the `docs/` directory of the [nuxt/nuxt](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt) repository and written in markdown.

::note
To preview the docs locally, follow the steps on [nuxt/nuxt.com](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.com) repository.
::

::note
We recommend that you install the [MDC extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Nuxt.mdc) for VS Code.
::

### Linting Docs

Documentation is linted using [MarkdownLint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) and [case police](https://github.com/antfu/case-police) to keep the documentation cohesive.

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm lint:docs
```

::note
You can also run `pnpm lint:docs:fix` to highlight and resolve any lint issues.
::

title: Configuration
description: Nuxt is configured with sensible defaults to make you productive.
navigation.icon: i-ph-gear
---

By default, Nuxt is configured to cover most use cases. The [`nuxt.config.ts`](/docs/guide/directory-structure/nuxt-config) file can override or extend this default configuration.

## Nuxt Configuration

The [`nuxt.config.ts`](/docs/guide/directory-structure/nuxt-config) file is located at the root of a Nuxt project and can override or extend the application's behavior.

A minimal configuration file exports the `defineNuxtConfig` function containing an object with your configuration. The `defineNuxtConfig` helper is globally available without import.

```ts twoslash [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // My Nuxt config
})
```

This file will often be mentioned in the documentation, for example to add custom scripts, register modules or change rendering modes.

::read-more{to="/docs/api/configuration/nuxt-config"}
Every option is described in the **Configuration Reference**.
::

::note
You don't have to use TypeScript to build an application with Nuxt. However, it is strongly recommended to use the `.ts` extension for the `nuxt.config` file. This way you can benefit from hints in your IDE to avoid typos and mistakes while editing your configuration.
::

### Environment Overrides

You can configure fully typed, per-environment overrides in your nuxt.config

```ts twoslash [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  $production: {
    routeRules: {
      '/**': { isr: true }
    }
  },
  $development: {
    //
  },
  $env: {
    staging: {
      // 
    }
  },
})
```

To select an environment when running a Nuxt CLI command, simply pass the name to the `--envName` flag, like so: `nuxi build --envName staging`.

To learn more about the mechanism behind these overrides, please refer to the `c12` documentation on [environment-specific configuration](https://github.com/unjs/c12?tab=readme-ov-file#environment-specific-configuration).

::tip{icon="i-ph-video" to="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFZI2iVCrNc" target="_blank"}
Watch a video from Alexander Lichter about the env-aware `nuxt.config.ts`.
::

::note
If you're authoring layers, you can also use the `$meta` key to provide metadata that you or the consumers of your layer might use.
::

### Environment Variables and Private Tokens

The `runtimeConfig` API exposes values like environment variables to the rest of your application. By default, these keys are only available server-side. The keys within `runtimeConfig.public` are also available client-side.

Those values should be defined in `nuxt.config` and can be overridden using environment variables.

::code-group

```ts twoslash [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  runtimeConfig: {
    // The private keys which are only available server-side
    apiSecret: '123',
    // Keys within public are also exposed client-side
    public: {
      apiBase: '/api'
    }
  }
})
```

```bash [.env]
# This will override the value of apiSecret
NUXT_API_SECRET=api_secret_token
```

::

These variables are exposed to the rest of your application using the [`useRuntimeConfig()`](/docs/api/composables/use-runtime-config) composable.

```vue [pages/index.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const runtimeConfig = useRuntimeConfig()
</script>
```

:read-more{to="/docs/guide/going-further/runtime-config"}

## App Configuration

The `app.config.ts` file, located in the source directory (by default the root of the project), is used to expose public variables that can be determined at build time. Contrary to the `runtimeConfig` option, these can not be overridden using environment variables.

A minimal configuration file exports the `defineAppConfig` function containing an object with your configuration. The `defineAppConfig` helper is globally available without import.

```ts [app.config.ts]
export default defineAppConfig({
  title: 'Hello Nuxt',
  theme: {
    dark: true,
    colors: {
      primary: '#ff0000'
    }
  }
})
```

These variables are exposed to the rest of your application using the [`useAppConfig`](/docs/api/composables/use-app-config) composable.

```vue [pages/index.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const appConfig = useAppConfig()
</script>
```

:read-more{to="/docs/guide/directory-structure/app-config"}

## `runtimeConfig` vs `app.config`

As stated above, `runtimeConfig` and `app.config` are both used to expose variables to the rest of your application. To determine whether you should use one or the other, here are some guidelines:

- `runtimeConfig`: Private or public tokens that need to be specified after build using environment variables.
- `app.config`: Public tokens that are determined at build time, website configuration such as theme variant, title and any project config that are not sensitive.

Feature                        | `runtimeConfig`  | `app.config`
-------------------------------|------------------|-------------------
Client Side                    | Hydrated         | Bundled
Environment Variables          | ✅ Yes           | ❌ No
Reactive                       | ✅ Yes           | ✅ Yes
Types support                  | ✅ Partial       | ✅ Yes
Configuration per Request      | ❌ No            | ✅ Yes
Hot Module Replacement         | ❌ No            | ✅ Yes
Non primitive JS types         | ❌ No            | ✅ Yes

## External Configuration Files

Nuxt uses [`nuxt.config.ts`](/docs/guide/directory-structure/nuxt-config) file as the single source of truth for configurations and skips reading external configuration files. During the course of building your project, you may have a need to configure those. The following table highlights common configurations and, where applicable, how they can be configured with Nuxt.

Name                                         | Config File               |  How To Configure
---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------
[Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io)               | ~~`nitro.config.ts`~~     | Use [`nitro`](/docs/api/nuxt-config#nitro) key in `nuxt.config`
[PostCSS](https://postcss.org)               | ~~`postcss.config.js`~~   | Use [`postcss`](/docs/api/nuxt-config#postcss) key in `nuxt.config`
[Vite](https://vite.dev)                     | ~~`vite.config.ts`~~      | Use [`vite`](/docs/api/nuxt-config#vite) key in `nuxt.config`
[webpack](https://webpack.js.org)            | ~~`webpack.config.ts`~~   | Use [`webpack`](/docs/api/nuxt-config#webpack-1) key in `nuxt.config`

Here is a list of other common config files:

Name                                         | Config File             | How To Configure

## Vue Configuration

### With Vite

If you need to pass options to `@vitejs/plugin-vue` or `@vitejs/plugin-vue-jsx`, you can do this in your `nuxt.config` file.

- `vite.vue` for `@vitejs/plugin-vue`. Check available options [here](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-vue/tree/main/packages/plugin-vue).
- `vite.vueJsx` for `@vitejs/plugin-vue-jsx`. Check available options [here](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-vue/tree/main/packages/plugin-vue-jsx).

```ts twoslash [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  vite: {
    vue: {
      customElement: true
    },
    vueJsx: {
      mergeProps: true
    }
  }
})
```

:read-more{to="/docs/api/configuration/nuxt-config#vue"}

### With webpack

If you use webpack and need to configure `vue-loader`, you can do this using `webpack.loaders.vue` key inside your `nuxt.config` file. The available options are [defined here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/blob/main/src/index.ts#L32-L62).

```ts twoslash [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  webpack: {
    loaders: {
      vue: {
        hotReload: true,
      }
    }
  }
})
```

:read-more{to="/docs/api/configuration/nuxt-config#loaders"}

### Enabling Experimental Vue Features

You may need to enable experimental features in Vue, such as `propsDestructure`. Nuxt provides an easy way to do that in `nuxt.config.ts`, no matter which builder you are using:

```ts twoslash [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  vue: {
    propsDestructure: true
  }
})
```

#### experimental `reactivityTransform` migration from Vue 3.4 and Nuxt 3.9

Since Nuxt 3.9 and Vue 3.4, `reactivityTransform` has been moved from Vue to Vue Macros which has a [Nuxt integration](https://vue-macros.dev/guide/nuxt-integration.html).

## Play Online

If you just want to play around with Nuxt in your browser without setting up a project, you can use one of our online sandboxes:

::card-group
  :card{title="Open on StackBlitz" icon="i-simple-icons-stackblitz" to="https://nuxt.new/s/v3" target="_blank"}
  :card{title="Open on CodeSandbox" icon="i-simple-icons-codesandbox" to="https://nuxt.new/c/v3" target="_blank"}
::

Or follow the steps below to set up a new Nuxt project on your computer.

## New Project

<!-- TODO: need to fix upstream in nuxt/nuxt.com -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD001 -->
#### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** - [`18.x`](https://nodejs.org/en) or newer (but we recommend the [active LTS release](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule))
- **Text editor** - There is no IDE requirement, but we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [official Vue extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (previously known as Volar) or [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), which, along with [other JetBrains IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com/ides/), offers great Nuxt support right out-of-the-box.
- **Terminal** - In order to run Nuxt commands

::note
  ::details
  :summary[Additional notes for an optimal setup:]
  - **Node.js**: Make sure to use an even numbered version (18, 20, etc)
  - **Nuxtr**: Install the community-developed [Nuxtr extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Nuxtr.nuxtr-vscode)
  ::
::

Open a terminal (if you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), you can open an [integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal)) and use the following command to create a new starter project:

::package-managers

```bash [npm]
npx nuxi@latest init <project-name>
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn dlx nuxi@latest init <project-name>
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm dlx nuxi@latest init <project-name>
```

```bash [bun]
bun x nuxi@latest init <project-name>
```

::

::tip
Alternatively, you can find other starters or themes by opening [nuxt.new](https://nuxt.new) and following the instructions there.
::

Open your project folder in Visual Studio Code:

```bash [Terminal]
code <project-name>
```

Or change directory into your new project from your terminal:

```bash
cd <project-name>
```

## Development Server

Now you'll be able to start your Nuxt app in development mode:

::package-managers

```bash [npm]
npm run dev -- -o
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn dev --open
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm dev -o
```

```bash [bun]
bun run dev -o

# To use the Bun runtime during development
# bun --bun run dev -o
```
::

::tip{icon="i-ph-check-circle"}
Well done! A browser window should automatically open for <http://localhost:3000>.
::

## Next Steps

Now that you've created your Nuxt project, you are ready to start building your application.
