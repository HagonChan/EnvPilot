##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to install dependencies and set up a environment that is able to run the tests of the project.

- You start with an initial Docker container based on ubuntu:22.04.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- No need to clone the project again.

The final objective is to successfully run the tests of the project.


### C-Specific Instructions:
- Install build-essential if not available: `apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential`
- Use `make` to build the project (check for Makefile)
- Use `gcc` or `clang` directly if no Makefile exists
- Check for CMakeLists.txt and use `cmake` if available
- Install dependencies through package manager (apt, yum, etc.)
- Look for configure scripts and run `./configure && make`


================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

    Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
        <command>bash command</command>
        e.g. install build-essential: <command>apt-get install -y build-essential</command>
        e.g. view file content: <command>cat README.md</command>
    Search: search the web for if you need some information, generate query and reply with following format:
        <search>the search query</search>
        e.g. <search>how to fix 'No module named setuptools'</search>
        e.g. <search>how to install python3 on ubuntu</search>
        e.g. <search>how to create development environment for python3</search>
    Stop: stop the setup loop once you think the setup is complete, reply with following format:
        <stop></stop>
    

Observation will be the result of running those actions.


Project Structure: the structure of the project, including files and directories.
Related Files: the content of related files of the project that may help you understand the project.
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: <command>your bash command here</command> or <search>your search query</search> or other actions available
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) ...
Thought: I think the setup should be fine
Action: <stop>stop the setup</stop>

# mrbgems

mrbgems is a library manager to integrate C and Ruby extension in an easy and
standardised way into mruby.

## Usage

By default mrbgems is currently deactivated. As soon as you add a GEM to your
build configuration (i.e. *build_config.rb*), mrbgems will be activated and the
extension integrated.

To add a GEM into the *build_config.rb* add the following line for example:
```ruby
conf.gem '/path/to/your/gem/dir'
```

You can also use a relative path which would be relative from the mruby root:
```ruby
conf.gem 'examples/mrbgems/ruby_extension_example'
```

A remote GIT repository location for a GEM is also supported:
```ruby
conf.gem :git => 'https://github.com/masuidrive/mrbgems-example.git', :branch => 'master'
conf.gem :github => 'masuidrive/mrbgems-example', :branch => 'master'
conf.gem :bitbucket => 'mruby/mrbgems-example', :branch => 'master'
```

To use mrbgem from [mgem-list](https://github.com/mruby/mgem-list) use `:mgem` option:
```ruby
conf.gem :mgem => 'mruby-yaml'
conf.gem :mgem => 'yaml' # 'mruby-' prefix could be omitted
```

If there is missing dependencies, mrbgem dependencies solver will reference
mrbgem from core or mgem-list.

To pull all gems from remote GIT repository on build, call ```./minirake -p```,
or ```./minirake --pull-gems```.

NOTE: `:bitbucket` option supports only git. Hg is unsupported in this version.

## GemBox

There are instances when you wish to add a collection of mrbgems into mruby at
once, or be able to substitute mrbgems based on configuration, without having to
add each gem to the *build_config.rb* file.  A packaged collection of mrbgems
is called a GemBox.  A GemBox is a file that contains a list of mrbgems to load
into mruby, in the same format as if you were adding them to *build_config.rb*
via `config.gem`, but wrapped in an `MRuby::GemBox` object.  GemBoxes are
loaded into mruby via `config.gembox 'boxname'`.

Below we have created a GemBox containing *mruby-time* and *mrbgems-example*:
```ruby
MRuby::GemBox.new do |conf|
  conf.gem "#{root}/mrbgems/mruby-time"
  conf.gem :github => 'masuidrive/mrbgems-example'
end
```

As mentioned, the GemBox uses the same conventions as `MRuby::Build`.  The GemBox
must be saved with a *.gembox* extension inside the *mrbgems* directory to to be
picked up by mruby.

To use this example GemBox, we save it as `custom.gembox` inside the *mrbgems*
directory in mruby, and add the following to our *build_config.rb* file inside
the build block:
```ruby
conf.gembox 'custom'
```
This will cause the *custom* GemBox to be read in during the build process,
adding *mruby-time* and *mrbgems-example* to the build.

If you want, you can put GemBox outside of mruby directory. In that case you must
specify an absolute path like below.
```ruby
conf.gembox "#{ENV["HOME"]}/mygemboxes/custom"
```

There are two GemBoxes that ship with mruby: [default](../../mrbgems/default.gembox)
and [full-core](../../mrbgems/full-core.gembox). The [default](../../mrbgems/default.gembox) GemBox
contains several core components of mruby, and [full-core](../../mrbgems/full-core.gembox)
contains every gem found in the *mrbgems* directory.

## GEM Structure

The maximal GEM structure looks like this:

	+- GEM_NAME         <- Name of GEM
	   |
	   +- include/      <- Header for Ruby extension (will exported)
	   |
	   +- mrblib/       <- Source for Ruby extension
	   |
	   +- src/          <- Source for C extension
	   |
	   +- test/         <- Test code (Ruby)
	   |
	   +- mrbgem.rake   <- GEM Specification
	   |
	   +- README.md     <- Readme for GEM

The folder *mrblib* contains pure Ruby files to extend mruby. The folder *src*
contains C/C++ files to extend mruby. The folder *include* contains C/C++ header
files. The folder *test* contains C/C++ and pure Ruby files for testing purposes
which will be used by `mrbtest`. *mrbgem.rake* contains the specification
to compile C and Ruby files. *README.md* is a short description of your GEM.

## Build process

mrbgems expects a specification file called *mrbgem.rake* inside of your
GEM directory. A typical GEM specification could look like this for example:
```ruby
MRuby::Gem::Specification.new('c_and_ruby_extension_example') do |spec|
  spec.license = 'MIT'
  spec.author  = 'mruby developers'
  spec.summary = 'Example mrbgem using C and ruby'
end
```

The mrbgems build process will use this specification to compile Object and Ruby
files. The compilation results will be added to *lib/libmruby.a*. This file exposes
the GEM functionality to tools like `mruby` and `mirb`.

The following properties can be set inside of your `MRuby::Gem::Specification` for
information purpose:

* `spec.license` or `spec.licenses` (A single license or a list of them under which this GEM is licensed)
* `spec.author` or `spec.authors` (Developer name or a list of them)
* `spec.version` (Current version)
* `spec.description` (Detailed description)
* `spec.summary`
  * One line short description of mrbgem.
  * Printed in build summary of rake when set.
* `spec.homepage` (Homepage)
* `spec.requirements` (External requirements as information for user)

The `license` and `author` properties are required in every GEM!

In case your GEM is depending on other GEMs please use
`spec.add_dependency(gem, *requirements[, default_get_info])` like:
```ruby
MRuby::Gem::Specification.new('c_and_ruby_extension_example') do |spec|
  spec.license = 'MIT'
  spec.author  = 'mruby developers'

  # Add GEM dependency mruby-parser.
  # The version must be between 1.0.0 and 1.5.2 .
  spec.add_dependency('mruby-parser', '>= 1.0.0', '<= 1.5.2')

  # Use any version of mruby-uv from github.
  spec.add_dependency('mruby-uv', '>= 0.0.0', :github => 'mattn/mruby-uv')

  # Use latest mruby-onig-regexp from github. (version requirements can be omitted)
  spec.add_dependency('mruby-onig-regexp', :github => 'mattn/mruby-onig-regexp')

  # You can add extra mgems active only on test
  spec.add_test_dependency('mruby-process', :github => 'iij/mruby-process')
end
```

The version requirements and default gem information are optional.

Version requirement supports following operators:
* '=': is equal
* '!=': is not equal
* '>': is greater
* '<': is lesser
* '>=': is equal or greater
* '<=': is equal or lesser
* '~>': is equal or greater and is lesser than the next major version
    * example 1: '~> 2.2.2' means '>= 2.2.2' and '< 2.3.0'
    * example 2: '~> 2.2'   means '>= 2.2.0' and '< 3.0.0'

When more than one version requirements is passed, the dependency must satisfy all of it.

You can have default gem to use as depedency when it's not defined in *build_config.rb*.
When the last argument of `add_dependency` call is `Hash`, it will be treated as default gem information.
Its format is same as argument of method `MRuby::Build#gem`, expect that it can't be treated as path gem location.

When a special version of depedency is required,
use `MRuby::Build#gem` in *build_config.rb* to override default gem.

If you have conflicting GEMs use the following method:
* `spec.add_conflict(gem, *requirements)`
    * The `requirements` argument is same as in `add_dependency` method.

like following code:
```ruby
MRuby::Gem::Specification.new 'some-regexp-binding' do |spec|
  spec.license = 'BSD'
  spec.author = 'John Doe'

  spec.add_conflict 'mruby-onig-regexp', '> 0.0.0'
  spec.add_conflict 'mruby-hs-regexp'
  spec.add_conflict 'mruby-pcre-regexp'
  spec.add_conflict 'mruby-regexp-pcre'
end
```

In case your GEM has more complex build requirements you can use
the following options additionally inside of your GEM specification:

* `spec.cc.flags` (C compiler flags)
* `spec.cc.defines` (C compiler defines)
* `spec.cc.include_paths` (C compiler include paths)
* `spec.linker.flags` (Linker flags)
* `spec.linker.libraries` (Linker libraries)
* `spec.linker.library_paths` (Linker additional library path)
* `spec.bins` (Generate binary file)
* `spec.rbfiles` (Ruby files to compile)
* `spec.objs` (Object files to compile)
* `spec.test_rbfiles` (Ruby test files for integration into mrbtest)
* `spec.test_objs` (Object test files for integration into mrbtest)
* `spec.test_preload` (Initialization files for mrbtest)

You also can use `spec.mruby.cc` and `spec.mruby.linker` to add extra global parameters for compiler and linker.

### include_paths and dependency

Your GEM can export include paths to another GEMs that depends on your GEM.
By default, `/...absolute path.../{GEM_NAME}/include` will be exported.
So it is recommended not to put GEM's local header files on include/.

These exports are retroactive.
For example: when B depends to C and A depends to B, A will get include paths exported by C.

Exported include_paths are automatically appended to GEM local include_paths by Minirake.
You can use `spec.export_include_paths` accessor if you want more complex build.


## C Extension

mruby can be extended with C. This is possible by using the C API to
integrate C libraries into mruby.

### Preconditions

mrbgems expects that you have implemented a C method called
`mrb_YOURGEMNAME_gem_init(mrb_state)`. `YOURGEMNAME` will be replaced
by the name of your GEM. If you call your GEM *c_extension_example*, your
initialisation method could look like this:
```C
void
mrb_c_extension_example_gem_init(mrb_state* mrb) {
  struct RClass *class_cextension = mrb_define_module(mrb, "CExtension");
  mrb_define_class_method(mrb, class_cextension, "c_method", mrb_c_method, MRB_ARGS_NONE());
}
```

### Finalize

mrbgems expects that you have implemented a C method called
`mrb_YOURGEMNAME_gem_final(mrb_state)`. `YOURGEMNAME` will be replaced
by the name of your GEM. If you call your GEM *c_extension_example*, your
finalizer method could look like this:

```C
void
mrb_c_extension_example_gem_final(mrb_state* mrb) {
  free(someone);
}
```

### Example

	+- c_extension_example/
	   |
	   +- src/
	   |  |
	   |  +- example.c         <- C extension source
	   |
	   +- test/
	   |  |
	   |  +- example.rb        <- Test code for C extension
	   |
	   +- mrbgem.rake          <- GEM specification
	   |
	   +- README.md

## Ruby Extension

mruby can be extended with pure Ruby. It is possible to override existing
classes or add new ones in this way. Put all Ruby files into the *mrblib*
folder.


### Pre-Conditions

none

### Example

	+- ruby_extension_example/
	   |
	   +- mrblib/
	   |  |
	   |  +- example.rb        <- Ruby extension source
	   |
	   +- test/
	   |  |
	   |  +- example.rb        <- Test code for Ruby extension
	   |
	   +- mrbgem.rake          <- GEM specification
	   |
	   +- README.md

## C and Ruby Extension

mruby can be extended with C and Ruby at the same time. It is possible to
override existing classes or add new ones in this way. Put all Ruby files
into the *mrblib* folder and all C files into the *src* folder.

mruby codes under *mrblib* directory would be executed after gem init C
function is called. Make sure *mruby script* depends on *C code* and
*C code* doesn't depend on *mruby script*.

### Pre-Conditions

See C and Ruby example.

### Example

	+- c_and_ruby_extension_example/
	   |
	   +- mrblib/
	   |  |
	   |  +- example.rb        <- Ruby extension source
	   |
	   +- src/
	   |  |
	   |  +- example.c         <- C extension source
	   |
	   +- test/
	   |  |
	   |  +- example.rb        <- Test code for C and Ruby extension
	   |
	   +- mrbgem.rake          <- GEM specification
	   |
	   +- README.md

## What is mruby

mruby is the lightweight implementation of the Ruby language complying to (part
of) the [ISO standard][ISO-standard]. Its syntax is Ruby 1.9 compatible.

mruby can be linked and embedded within your application.  We provide the
interpreter program "mruby" and the interactive mruby shell "mirb" as examples.
You can also compile Ruby programs into compiled byte code using the mruby
compiler "mrbc".  All those tools reside in the "bin" directory.  "mrbc" is
also able to generate compiled byte code in a C source file, see the "mrbtest"
program under the "test" directory for an example.

This achievement was sponsored by the Regional Innovation Creation R&D Programs
of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan.

## How to get mruby

The stable version 1.2.0 of mruby can be downloaded via the following URL: [https://github.com/mruby/mruby/archive/1.2.0.zip](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/archive/1.2.0.zip)

The latest development version of mruby can be downloaded via the following URL: [https://github.com/mruby/mruby/zipball/master](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/zipball/master)

The trunk of the mruby source tree can be checked out with the
following command:

    $ git clone https://github.com/mruby/mruby.git

You can also install and compile mruby using [ruby-install](https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install), [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build) or [rvm](https://github.com/rvm/rvm).

## mruby home-page

The URL of the mruby home-page is: [http://www.mruby.org](http://www.mruby.org).

## Mailing list

We don't have a mailing list, but you can use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/mruby/mruby).

## How to compile and install (mruby and gems)

See the [doc/guides/compile.md](doc/guides/compile.md) file.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, execute the following from the project's root directory.

    $ make test

Or

    $ ruby ./minirake test

## How to customize mruby (mrbgems)

mruby contains a package manager called *mrbgems*. To create extensions
in C and/or Ruby you should create a *GEM*. For a documentation of how to
use mrbgems consult the file [doc/guides/mrbgems.md](doc/guides/mrbgems.md). For example code of
how to use mrbgems look into the folder *examples/mrbgems/*.

## License

mruby is released under the [MIT License](MITL).

## Note for License

mruby has chosen a MIT License due to its permissive license allowing
developers to target various environments such as embedded systems.
However, the license requires the display of the copyright notice and license
information in manuals for instance. Doing so for big projects can be
complicated or troublesome.  This is why mruby has decided to display "mruby
developers" as the copyright name to make it simple conventionally.
In the future, mruby might ask you to distribute your new code
(that you will commit,) under the MIT License as a member of
"mruby developers" but contributors will keep their copyright.
(We did not intend for contributors to transfer or waive their copyrights,
Actual copyright holder name (contributors) will be listed in the AUTHORS
file.)

Please ask us if you want to distribute your code under another license.

# mruby configuration macros.

## How to use these macros.
You can use mrbconfs with following ways:
* Write them in `mrbconf.h`.
 * Using compiler flags is preferred  when building a cross binaries or multiple mruby binaries
 since it's easier to use different mrbconf per each `MRuby::Build`.
 * Most flags can be enabled by just commenting in.
* Pass them as compiler flags.
 * Make sure you pass the same flags to all compilers since some mrbconf(e.g., `MRB_GC_FIXED_ARENA`)
 changes `struct` layout and cause memory access error when C and other language(e.g., C++) is mixed.

## stdio setting.
`MRB_DISABLE_STDIO`
* When defined `<stdio.h>` functions won't be used.
* Some features will be disabled when this is enabled:
  * `mrb_irep` load/dump from/to file.
  * Compiling mruby script from file.
  * Printing features in **src/print.c**.

## Debug macros.
`MRB_ENABLE_DEBUG_HOOK`
* When defined code fetch hook and debug OP hook will be enabled.
* When using any of the hook set function pointer `code_fetch_hook` and/or `debug_op_hook` of `mrb_state`.
* Fetch hook will be called before any OP.
* Debug OP hook will be called when dispatching `OP_DEBUG`.

`MRB_DEBUG`
* When defined `mrb_assert*` macro will be defined with macros from `<assert.h>`.
* Could be enabled via `enable_debug` method of `MRuby::Build`.

## Stack configuration

`MRB_STACK_EXTEND_DOUBLING`
* If defined doubles the stack size when extending it.
* Else extends stack with `MRB_STACK_GROWTH`.

`MRB_STACK_GROWTH`
* Default value is `128`.
* Used in stack extending.
* Ignored when `MRB_STACK_EXTEND_DOUBLING` is defined.

`MRB_STACK_MAX`
* Default value is `0x40000 - MRB_STACK_GROWTH`.
* Raises `RuntimeError` when stack size exceeds this value.

## Primitive type configuration.

`MRB_USE_FLOAT`
* When defined single precision floating point type(C type `float`) is used as `mrb_float`.
* Else double precision floating point type(C type `double`) is used as `mrb_float`.

`MRB_INT16`
* When defined `int16_t` will be defined as `mrb_int`.
* Conflicts with `MRB_INT64`.

`MRB_INT64`
* When defined `int64_t` will be defined as `mrb_int`.
* Conflicts with `MRB_INT16`.
* When `MRB_INT16` or `MRB_INT64` isn't defined `int`(most of the times 32-bit integer)
will be defined as `mrb_int`.

## Garbage collector configuration.

`MRB_GC_STRESS`
* When defined full GC is emitted per each `RBasic` allocation.
* Mainly used in memory manager debugging.

`MRB_GC_TURN_OFF_GENERATIONAL`
* When defined turns generational GC by default.

`MRB_GC_FIXED_ARENA`
* When defined used fixed size GC arena.
* Raises `RuntimeError` when this is defined and GC arena size exceeds `MRB_GC_ARENA_SIZE`.
* Useful tracking unnecessary mruby object allocation.

`MRB_GC_ARENA_SIZE`
* Default value is `100`.
* Ignored when `MRB_GC_FIXED_ARENA` isn't defined.
* Defines fixed GC arena size.

`MRB_HEAP_PAGE_SIZE`
* Defines value is `1024`.
* Specifies number of `RBasic` per each heap page.

## Memory pool configuration.

`POOL_ALIGNMENT`
* Default value is `4`.
* If you're allocating data types that requires alignment more than default value define the
largest value of required alignment.

`POOL_PAGE_SIZE`
* Default value is `16000`.
* Specifies page size of pool page.
* Smaller the value is increases memory overhead.

## State atexit configuration.

`MRB_FIXED_STATE_ATEXIT_STACK`
* If defined enables fixed size `mrb_state` atexit stack.
* Raises `RuntimeError` when `mrb_state_atexit` call count to same `mrb_state` exceeds
`MRB_FIXED_STATE_ATEXIT_STACK_SIZE`'s value.

`MRB_FIXED_STATE_ATEXIT_STACK_SIZE`
* Default value is `5`.
* If `MRB_FIXED_STATE_ATEXIT_STACK` isn't defined this macro is ignored.

## `mrb_value` configuration.

`MRB_ENDIAN_BIG`
* If defined compiles mruby for big endian machines.
* Used in `MRB_NAN_BOXING`.
* Some mrbgem use this mrbconf.

`MRB_NAN_BOXING`
* If defined represent `mrb_value` in boxed `double`.
* Conflicts with `MRB_USE_FLOAT`.

`MRB_WORD_BOXING`
* If defined represent `mrb_value` as a word.
* If defined `Float` will be a mruby object with `RBasic`.

## Instance variable configuration.
`MRB_USE_IV_SEGLIST`
* If defined enable segmented list in instance variable table instead of khash.
* Segmented list is a linked list of key and value segments.
* It will linear search instead of hash search.

`MRB_SEGMENT_SIZE`
* Default value is `4`.
* Specifies size of each segment in segment list.
* Ignored when `MRB_USE_IV_SEGLIST` isn't defined.

`MRB_IVHASH_INIT_SIZE`
* Default value is `8`.
* Specifies initial size for instance variable table.
* Ignored when `MRB_USE_IV_SEGLIST` is defined.

## Other configuration.
`MRB_UTF8_STRING`
* Adds UTF-8 encoding support to character-oriented String instance methods.
* If it isn't defined, they only support the US-ASCII encoding.

`MRB_FUNCALL_ARGC_MAX`
* Default value is `16`.
* Specifies 4th argument(`argc`) max value of `mrb_funcall`.
* Raises `ArgumentError` when the `argc` argument is bigger then this value `mrb_funcall`.

`KHASH_DEFAULT_SIZE`
* Default value is `32`.
* Specifies default size of khash table bucket.
* Used in `kh_init_ ## name` function.

`MRB_STR_BUF_MIN_SIZE`
* Default value is `128`.
* Specifies initial capacity of `RString` created by `mrb_str_buf_new` function..

# Compile

mruby uses Rake to compile and cross-compile all libraries and
binaries.

## Prerequisites

To compile mruby out of the source code you need the following tools:
* C Compiler (i.e. ```gcc```)
* Linker (i.e. ```gcc```)
* Archive utility (i.e. ```ar```)
* Parser generator (i.e. ```bison```)
* Ruby 1.8 or 1.9 (i.e. ```ruby``` or ```jruby```)

Optional:
* GIT (to update mruby source and integrate mrbgems easier)
* C++ compiler (to use GEMs which include \*.cpp, \*.cxx, \*.cc)
* Assembler (to use GEMs which include \*.asm)

## Usage

Inside of the root directory of the mruby source a file exists
called *build_config.rb*. This file contains the build configuration
of mruby and looks like this for example:
```ruby
MRuby::Build.new do |conf|
  toolchain :gcc
end
```

All tools necessary to compile mruby can be set or modified here. In case
you want to maintain an additional *build_config.rb* you can define a
customized path using the *$MRUBY_CONFIG* environment variable.

To compile just call ```./minirake``` inside of the mruby source root. To
generate and execute the test tools call ```./minirake test```. To clean
all build files call ```./minirake clean```. To see full command line on
build, call ```./minirake -v```.

## Build Configuration

Inside of the *build_config.rb* the following options can be configured
based on your environment.

### Toolchains

The mruby build system already contains a set of toolchain templates which
configure the build environment for specific compiler infrastructures.

#### GCC

Toolchain configuration for the GNU C Compiler.
```ruby
toolchain :gcc
```

#### clang

Toolchain configuration for the LLVM C Compiler clang. Mainly equal to the
GCC toolchain.
```ruby
toolchain :clang
```

#### Visual Studio 2010, 2012 and 2013

Toolchain configuration for Visual Studio on Windows. If you use the
[Visual Studio Command Prompt](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229859\(v=vs.110\).aspx),
you normally do not have to specify this manually, since it gets automatically detected by our build process.
```ruby
toolchain :visualcpp
```

#### Android

Toolchain configuration for Android.
```ruby
toolchain :android
```

Requires the custom standalone Android NDK and the toolchain path
in ```ANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN```.

### Binaries

It is possible to select which tools should be compiled during the compilation
process. The following tools can be selected:
* mruby (mruby interpreter)
* mirb (mruby interactive shell)

To select them declare conf.gem as follows:
```ruby
conf.gem "#{root}/mrbgems/mruby-bin-mruby"
conf.gem "#{root}/mrbgems/mruby-bin-mirb"
```

### File Separator

Some environments require a different file separator character. It is possible to
set the character via ```conf.file_separator```.
```ruby
conf.file_separator = '/'
```

### C Compiler

Configuration of the C compiler binary, flags and include paths.
```ruby
conf.cc do |cc|
  cc.command = ...
  cc.flags = ...
  cc.include_paths = ...
  cc.defines = ...
  cc.option_include_path = ...
  cc.option_define = ...
  cc.compile_options = ...
end
```

C Compiler has header searcher to detect installed library.

If you need a include path of header file use ```search_header_path```:
```ruby
# Searches ```iconv.h```.
# If found it will return include path of the header file.
# Otherwise it will return nil .
fail 'iconv.h not found' unless conf.cc.search_header_path 'iconv.h'
```

If you need a full file name of header file use ```search_header```:
```ruby
# Searches ```iconv.h```.
# If found it will return full path of the header file.
# Otherwise it will return nil .
iconv_h = conf.cc.search_header 'iconv.h'
print "iconv.h found: #{iconv_h}\n"
```

Header searcher uses compiler's ```include_paths``` by default.
When you are using GCC toolchain (including clang toolchain since its base is gcc toolchain)
it will use compiler specific include paths too. (For example ```/usr/local/include```, ```/usr/include```)

If you need a special header search paths define a singleton method ```header_search_paths``` to C compiler:
```ruby
def conf.cc.header_search_paths
  ['/opt/local/include'] + include_paths
end
```

### Linker

Configuration of the Linker binary, flags and library paths.
```ruby
conf.linker do |linker|
  linker.command = ...
  linker.flags = ...
  linker.flags_before_libraries = ...
  linker.libraries = ...
  linker.flags_after_libraries = ...
  linker.library_paths = ....
  linker.option_library = ...
  linker.option_library_path = ...
  linker.link_options = ...
end
```

### Archiver

Configuration of the Archiver binary and flags.
```ruby
conf.archiver do |archiver|
  archiver.command = ...
  archiver.archive_options = ...
end
```

### Parser Generator

Configuration of the Parser Generator binary and flags.
```ruby
conf.yacc do |yacc|
  yacc.command = ...
  yacc.compile_options = ...
end
```

### GPerf

Configuration of the GPerf binary and flags.
```ruby
conf.gperf do |gperf|
  gperf.command = ...
  gperf.compile_options = ...
end
```

### File Extensions
```ruby
conf.exts do |exts|
  exts.object = ...
  exts.executable = ...
  exts.library = ...
end
```

### Mrbgems

Integrate GEMs in the build process.
```ruby
# Integrate GEM with additional configuration
conf.gem 'path/to/gem' do |g|
  g.cc.flags << ...
end

# Integrate GEM without additional configuration
conf.gem 'path/to/another/gem'
```

See doc/mrbgems/README.md for more option about mrbgems.

### Mrbtest

Configuration Mrbtest build process.

If you want mrbtest.a only, You should set ```conf.build_mrbtest_lib_only```
```ruby
conf.build_mrbtest_lib_only
```

### Bintest

Tests for mrbgem tools using CRuby.
To have bintests place \*.rb scripts to ```bintest/``` directory of mrbgems.
See ```mruby-bin-*/bintest/*.rb``` if you need examples.
If you want a temporary files use `tempfile` module of CRuby instead of ```/tmp/```.

You can enable it with following:
```ruby
conf.enable_bintest
```

### C++ ABI

By default, mruby uses setjmp/longjmp to implement its
exceptions. But it doesn't release C++ stack object
correctly. To support mrbgems written in C++, mruby can be
configured to use C++ exception.

There are two levels of C++ exception handling. The one is
```enable_cxx_exception``` that enables C++ exception, but
uses C ABI. The other is ```enable_cxx_abi``` where all
files are compiled by C++ compiler.

When you mix C++ code, C++ exception would be enabled automatically.
If you need to enable C++ exception explicitly add the following:
```ruby
conf.enable_cxx_exception
```

#### C++ exception disabling.

If your compiler does not support C++ and you want to ensure
you don't use mrbgem written in C++, you can explicitly disable
C++ exception, add following:
```ruby
conf.disable_cxx_exception
```
and you will get an error when you try to use C++ gem.
Note that it must be called before ```enable_cxx_exception``` or ```gem``` method.

### Debugging mode

To enable debugging mode add the following:
```ruby
conf.enable_debug
```

When debugging mode is enabled
* Macro ```MRB_DEBUG``` would be defined.
	* Which means ```mrb_assert()``` macro is enabled.
* Debug information of irep would be generated by ```mrbc```.
	* Because ```-g``` flag would be added to ```mrbc``` runner.
    * You can have better backtrace of mruby scripts with this.

## Cross-Compilation

mruby can also be cross-compiled from one platform to another. To
achieve this the *build_config.rb* needs to contain an instance of
```MRuby::CrossBuild```. This instance defines the compilation
tools and flags for the target platform. An example could look
like this:
```ruby
MRuby::CrossBuild.new('32bit') do |conf|
  toolchain :gcc

  conf.cc.flags << "-m32"
  conf.linker.flags << "-m32"
end
```

All configuration options of ```MRuby::Build``` can also be used
in ```MRuby::CrossBuild```.

### Mrbtest in Cross-Compilation

In cross compilation, you can run ```mrbtest``` on emulator if
you have it by changing configuration of test runner.
```ruby
conf.test_runner do |t|
  t.command = ... # set emulator. this value must be non nil or false
  t.flags = ... # set flags of emulator

  def t.run(bin) # override `run` if you need to change the behavior of it
    ... # `bin` is the full path of mrbtest
  end
end
```

## Build process

During the build process the directory *build* will be created in the
root directory. The structure of this directory will look like this:

	+- build
	   |
	   +-  host
	       |
	       +- bin          <- Binaries (mirb, mrbc and mruby)
	       |
	       +- lib          <- Libraries (libmruby.a and libmruby_core.a)
	       |
	       +- mrblib
	       |
	       +- src
	       |
	       +- test         <- mrbtest tool
	       |
	       +- tools
	          |
	          +- mirb
	          |
	          +- mrbc
	          |
	          +- mruby

The compilation workflow will look like this:
* compile all files under *src* (object files will be stored
in *build/host/src*)
* generate parser grammar out of *src/parse.y* (generated
result will be stored in *build/host/src/y.tab.c*)
* compile  *build/host/src/y.tab.c* to  *build/host/src/y.tab.o*
* create *build/host/lib/libmruby_core.a* out of all object files (C only)
* create ```build/host/bin/mrbc``` by compiling *t
... (truncated due to size)
