##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to install dependencies and set up a environment that is able to run the tests of the project.

- You start with an initial Docker container based on ubuntu:22.04.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- No need to clone the project again.

The final objective is to successfully run the tests of the project.


### Python-Specific Instructions:
- Make sure the package is installed from source in editable mode before running tests (e.g., `pip install -e .`)
- Avoid using tox to run tests if possible as it's designed for CI. Read tox.ini to understand setup
- Check requirements.txt, setup.py, or pyproject.toml for dependencies


================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

    Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
        <command>bash command</command>
        e.g. install build-essential: <command>apt-get install -y build-essential</command>
        e.g. view file content: <command>cat README.md</command>
    Search: search the web for if you need some information, generate query and reply with following format:
        <search>the search query</search>
        e.g. <search>how to fix 'No module named setuptools'</search>
        e.g. <search>how to install python3 on ubuntu</search>
        e.g. <search>how to create development environment for python3</search>
    Stop: stop the setup loop once you think the setup is complete, reply with following format:
        <stop></stop>
    

Observation will be the result of running those actions.

seaborn: statistical data visualization
=======================================

[![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/seaborn.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/seaborn/)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/seaborn.svg)](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/blob/master/LICENSE)
[![DOI](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03021/status.svg)](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.03021)

[![Code Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/mwaskom/seaborn/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/mwaskom/seaborn)

Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.


Documentation
-------------

Online documentation is available at [seaborn.pydata.org](https://seaborn.pydata.org).

The docs include a [tutorial](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html), [example gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html), [API reference](https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html), [FAQ](https://seaborn.pydata.org/faq), and other useful information.

To build the documentation locally, please refer to [`doc/README.md`](doc/README.md).

Dependencies
------------

Seaborn supports Python 3.7+ and no longer supports Python 2.

Installation requires [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). Some advanced statistical functionality requires [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) and/or [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/).


Installation
------------

The latest stable release (and required dependencies) can be installed from PyPI:

    pip install seaborn

It is also possible to include optional statistical dependencies (only relevant for v0.12+):

    pip install seaborn[stats]

Seaborn can also be installed with conda:

    conda install seaborn

Note that the main anaconda repository lags PyPI in adding new releases, but conda-forge (`-c conda-forge`) typically updates quickly.

Citing
------

A paper describing seaborn has been published in the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03021). The paper provides an introduction to the key features of the library, and it can be used as a citation if seaborn proves integral to a scientific publication.

Testing
-------

Testing seaborn requires installing additional dependencies; they can be installed with the `dev` extra (e.g., `pip install .[dev]`).

To test the code, run `make test` in the source directory. This will exercise the unit tests (using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)) and generate a coverage report.

Code style is enforced with `flake8` using the settings in the [`setup.cfg`](./setup.cfg) file. Run `make lint` to check. Alternately, you can use `pre-commit` to automatically run lint checks on any files you are committing: just run `pre-commit install` to set it up, and then commit as usual going forward.

Development
-----------

Seaborn development takes place on Github: https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn

Please submit bugs that you encounter to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues) with a reproducible example demonstrating the problem. Questions about usage are more at home on StackOverflow, where there is a [seaborn tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/seaborn).

.. currentmodule:: seaborn

Installing and getting started
------------------------------

Official releases of seaborn can be installed from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/seaborn/>`_::

    pip install seaborn

The basic invocation of `pip` will install seaborn and, if necessary, its mandatory dependencies.
It is possible to include optional dependencies that give access to a few advanced features::

    pip install seaborn[stats]

The library is also included as part of the `Anaconda <https://repo.anaconda.com/>`_ distribution,
and it can be installed with `conda`::

    conda install seaborn

As the main Anaconda repository can be slow to add new releases, you may prefer using the
`conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org/>`_ channel::

    conda install seaborn -c conda-forge

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Supported Python versions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Python 3.7+

Mandatory dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- `numpy <https://numpy.org/>`__

- `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`__

- `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`__

Optional dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- `statsmodels <https://www.statsmodels.org/>`__, for advanced regression plots

- `scipy <https://www.scipy.org/>`__, for clustering matrices and some advanced options

- `fastcluster <https://pypi.org/project/fastcluster/>`__, faster clustering of large matrices

Quickstart
~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have seaborn installed, you're ready to get started.
To test it out, you could load and plot one of the example datasets::

    import seaborn as sns
    df = sns.load_dataset("penguins")
    sns.pairplot(df, hue="species")

If you're working in a Jupyter notebook or an IPython terminal with
`matplotlib mode <https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/plotting.html>`_
enabled, you should immediately see :ref:`the plot <scatterplot_matrix>`.
Otherwise, you may need to explicitly call :func:`matplotlib.pyplot.show`::

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.show()

While you can get pretty far with only seaborn imported, having access to
matplotlib functions is often useful. The tutorials and API documentation
typically assume the following imports::

    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd

    import matplotlib as mpl
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    import seaborn as sns
    import seaborn.objects as so

Debugging install issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The seaborn codebase is pure Python, and the library should generally install
without issue. Occasionally, difficulties will arise because the dependencies
include compiled code and link to system libraries. These difficulties
typically manifest as errors on import with messages such as ``"DLL load
failed"``. To debug such problems, read through the exception trace to
figure out which specific library failed to import, and then consult the
installation docs for that package to see if they have tips for your particular
system.

In some cases, an installation of seaborn will appear to succeed, but trying
to import it will raise an error with the message ``"No module named
seaborn"``. This usually means that you have multiple Python installations on
your system and that your ``pip`` or ``conda`` points towards a different
installation than where your interpreter lives. Resolving this issue
will involve sorting out the paths on your system, but it can sometimes be
avoided by invoking ``pip`` with ``python -m pip install seaborn``.

Getting help
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you think you've encountered a bug in seaborn, please report it on the
`GitHub issue tracker <https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues>`_.
To be useful, bug reports must include the following information:

- A reproducible code example that demonstrates the problem
- The output that you are seeing (an image of a plot, or the error message)
- A clear explanation of why you think something is wrong
- The specific versions of seaborn and matplotlib that you are working with

Bug reports are easiest to address if they can be demonstrated using one of the
example datasets from the seaborn docs (i.e. with :func:`load_dataset`).
Otherwise, it is preferable that your example generate synthetic data to
reproduce the problem. If you can only demonstrate the issue with your
actual dataset, you will need to share it, ideally as a csv.

If you've encountered an error, searching the specific text of the message
before opening a new issue can often help you solve the problem quickly and
avoid making a duplicate report.

Because matplotlib handles the actual rendering, errors or incorrect outputs
may be due to a problem in matplotlib rather than one in seaborn. It can save time
if you try to reproduce the issue in an example that uses only matplotlib,
so that you can report it in the right place. But it is alright to skip this
step if it's not obvious how to do it.

General support questions are more at home on either `stackoverflow
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/seaborn/>`_, where there is a
larger audience of people who will see your post and may be able to offer
assistance. Your chance of getting a quick answer will be higher if you include
`runnable code <https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example>`_,
a precise statement of what you are hoping to achieve, and a clear explanation
of the problems that you have encountered.

```
Building the seaborn docs
=========================

Building the docs requires additional dependencies; they can be installed with `pip install seaborn[stats,docs]`.

The build process involves conversion of Jupyter notebooks to `rst` files. To facilitate this, you may need to set `NB_KERNEL` environment variable to the name of a kernel on your machine (e.g. `export NB_KERNEL="python3"`). To get a list of available Python kernels, run `jupyter kernelspec list`.

After you're set up, run `make notebooks html` from the `doc` directory to convert all notebooks, generate all gallery examples, and build the documentation itself. The site will live in `_build/html`.

Run `make clean` to delete the built site and all intermediate files. Run `make -C docstrings clean` or `make -C tutorial clean` to remove intermediate files for the API or tutorial components.

If your goal is to obtain an offline copy of the docs for a released version, it may be easier to clone the [website repository](https://github.com/seaborn/seaborn.github.io) or to download a zipfile corresponding to a [specific version](https://github.com/seaborn/seaborn.github.io/tags).
