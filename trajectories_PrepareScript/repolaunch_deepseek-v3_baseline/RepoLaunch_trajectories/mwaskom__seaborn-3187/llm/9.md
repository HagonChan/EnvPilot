##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

------ START FILE doc/README.md ------
Building the seaborn docs
=========================

Building the docs requires additional dependencies; they can be installed with `pip install seaborn[stats,docs]`.

The build process involves conversion of Jupyter notebooks to `rst` files. To facilitate this, you may need to set `NB_KERNEL` environment variable to the name of a kernel on your machine (e.g. `export NB_KERNEL="python3"`). To get a list of available Python kernels, run `jupyter kernelspec list`.

After you're set up, run `make notebooks html` from the `doc` directory to convert all notebooks, generate all gallery examples, and build the documentation itself. The site will live in `_build/html`.

Run `make clean` to delete the built site and all intermediate files. Run `make -C docstrings clean` or `make -C tutorial clean` to remove intermediate files for the API or tutorial components.

If your goal is to obtain an offline copy of the docs for a released version, it may be easier to clone the [website repository](https://github.com/seaborn/seaborn.github.io) or to download a zipfile corresponding to a [specific version](https://github.com/seaborn/seaborn.github.io/tags).
