##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

### File:
------ START FILE documentation/project/contributing/prerequisites.md ------
### Prerequisites

This page explains how to get the software you need to use a Linux or macOS
machine for local development.

Before you begin contributing you must have:

* A GitHub account
* `Java` 17 or newer
* `Git`
* `Docker`

### Installing prerequisites on macOS

1. Install [brew](https://brew.sh/).
2. Install brew cask:
```sh
brew cask
```
3. Install Eclipse Temurin 17 via Homebrew cask:
```sh
brew tap homebrew/cask-versions
brew install temurin17
```
4. Verify Installation
```sh
java -version
```
Note : In case OpenJDK 17 is not set as your default Java, you can consider to include it in your `$PATH` after installation
```sh
export PATH="$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17)/bin:$PATH"
export JAVA_HOME="$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17)"
```

## Tips

Consider allocating not less than 4GB of memory for your docker.
Otherwise, some apps within a stack (e.g. `kafka-ui.yaml`) might crash.

## Where to go next

In the next section, you'll [learn how to Build and Run kafka-ui](building.md).
