##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to install dependencies and set up a environment that is able to run the tests of the project.

- You start with an initial Docker container based on ubuntu:22.04.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- No need to clone the project again.

The final objective is to successfully run the tests of the project.


### Go-Specific Instructions:
- Use `go mod download` to download dependencies
- Use `go test ./...` to run all tests
- Use `go build` to build the project
- Check go.mod for module dependencies
- Use `go get` to install missing dependencies


================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

    Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
        <command>bash command</command>
        e.g. install build-essential: <command>apt-get install -y build-essential</command>
        e.g. view file content: <command>cat README.md</command>
    Search: search the web for if you need some information, generate query and reply with following format:
        <search>the search query</search>
        e.g. <search>how to fix 'No module named setuptools'</search>
        e.g. <search>how to install python3 on ubuntu</search>
        e.g. <search>how to create development environment for python3</search>
    Stop: stop the setup loop once you think the setup is complete, reply with following format:
        <stop></stop>
    

Observation will be the result of running those actions.


Project Structure: the structure of the project, including files and directories.
Related Files: the content of related files of the project that may help you understand the project.
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: <command>your bash command here</command> or <search>your search query</search> or other actions available
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) ...
Thought: I think the setup should be fine
Action: <stop>stop the setup</stop>
Answer: the final result

## What is frp?

frp is a fast reverse proxy that allows you to expose a local server located behind a NAT or firewall to the Internet. It currently supports **TCP** and **UDP**, as well as **HTTP** and **HTTPS** protocols, enabling requests to be forwarded to internal services via domain name.

frp also offers a P2P connect mode.

## Development Status

frp is currently under development. You can try the latest release version in the `master` branch, or use the `dev` branch to access the version currently in development.

We are currently working on version 2 and attempting to perform some code refactoring and improvements. However, please note that it will not be compatible with version 1.

We will transition from version 0 to version 1 at the appropriate time and will only accept bug fixes and improvements, rather than big feature requests.

### About V2

The overall situation is currently unfavorable, and there is significant pressure in both personal and professional aspects.

The complexity and difficulty of the v2 version are much higher than anticipated. I can only work on its development during fragmented time periods, and the constant interruptions disrupt productivity significantly. Given this situation, we will continue to optimize and iterate on the current version until we have more free time to proceed with the major version overhaul.

The concept behind v2 is based on my years of experience and reflection in the cloud-native domain, particularly in K8s and ServiceMesh. Its core is a modernized four-layer and seven-layer proxy, similar to envoy. This proxy itself is highly scalable, not only capable of implementing the functionality of intranet penetration but also applicable to various other domains. Building upon this highly scalable core, we aim to implement all the capabilities of frp v1 while also addressing the functionalities that were previously unachievable or difficult to implement in an elegant manner. Furthermore, we will maintain efficient development and iteration capabilities.

In addition, I envision frp itself becoming a highly extensible system and platform, similar to how we can provide a range of extension capabilities based on K8s. In K8s, we can customize development according to enterprise needs, utilizing features such as CRD, controller mode, webhook, CSI, and CNI. In frp v1, we introduced the concept of server plugins, which implemented some basic extensibility. However, it relies on a simple HTTP protocol and requires users to start independent processes and manage them on their own. This approach is far from flexible and convenient, and real-world demands vary greatly. It is unrealistic to expect a non-profit open-source project maintained by a few individuals to meet everyone's needs.

Finally, we acknowledge that the current design of modules such as configuration management, permission verification, certificate management, and API management is not modern enough. While we may carry out some optimizations in the v1 version, ensuring compatibility remains a challenging issue that requires a considerable amount of effort to address.

We sincerely appreciate your support for frp.

## Architecture

![architecture](/doc/pic/architecture.png)

## Example Usage

To begin, download the latest program for your operating system and architecture from the [Release](https://github.com/fatedier/frp/releases) page.

Next, place the `frps` binary and server configuration file on Server A, which has a public IP address.

Finally, place the `frpc` binary and client configuration file on Server B, which is located on a LAN that cannot be directly accessed from the public internet.

Some antiviruses improperly mark frpc as malware and delete it. This is due to frp being a networking tool capable of creating reverse proxies. Antiviruses sometimes flag reverse proxies due to their ability to bypass firewall port restrictions. If you are using antivirus, then you may need to whitelist/exclude frpc in your antivirus settings to avoid accidental quarantine/deletion. See [issue 3637](https://github.com/fatedier/frp/issues/3637) for more details.

### Access your computer in a LAN network via SSH

1. Modify `frps.toml` on server A by setting the `bindPort` for frp clients to connect to:

  ```toml
  # frps.toml
  bindPort = 7000
  ```

2. Start `frps` on server A:

  `./frps -c ./frps.toml`

3. Modify `frpc.toml` on server B and set the `serverAddr` field to the public IP address of your frps server:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = "x.x.x.x"
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = "ssh"
  type = "tcp"
  localIP = "127.0.0.1"
  localPort = 22
  remotePort = 6000
  ```

Note that the `localPort` (listened on the client) and `remotePort` (exposed on the server) are used for traffic going in and out of the frp system, while the `serverPort` is used for communication between frps and frpc.

4. Start `frpc` on server B:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.toml`

5. To access server B from another machine through server A via SSH (assuming the username is `test`), use the following command:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 test@x.x.x.x`

### Multiple SSH services sharing the same port

This example implements multiple SSH services exposed through the same port using a proxy of type tcpmux. Similarly, as long as the client supports the HTTP Connect proxy connection method, port reuse can be achieved in this way.

1. Deploy frps on a machine with a public IP and modify the frps.toml file. Here is a simplified configuration:

  ```toml
  bindPort = 7000
  tcpmuxHTTPConnectPort = 5002
  ```

2. Deploy frpc on the internal machine A with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  serverAddr = "x.x.x.x"
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = "ssh1"
  type = "tcpmux"
  multiplexer = "httpconnect"
  customDomains = ["machine-a.example.com"]
  localIP = "127.0.0.1"
  localPort = 22
  ```

3. Deploy another frpc on the internal machine B with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  serverAddr = "x.x.x.x"
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = "ssh2"
  type = "tcpmux"
  multiplexer = "httpconnect"
  customDomains = ["machine-b.example.com"]
  localIP = "127.0.0.1"
  localPort = 22
  ```

4. To access internal machine A using SSH ProxyCommand, assuming the username is "test":

  `ssh -o 'proxycommand socat - PROXY:x.x.x.x:machine-a.example.com:22,proxyport=5002' test@machine-a`

5. To access internal machine B, the only difference is the domain name, assuming the username is "test":

  `ssh -o 'proxycommand socat - PROXY:x.x.x.x:machine-b.example.com:22,proxyport=5002' test@machine-b`

### Accessing Internal Web Services with Custom Domains in LAN

Sometimes we need to expose a local web service behind a NAT network to others for testing purposes with our own domain name.

Unfortunately, we cannot resolve a domain name to a local IP. However, we can use frp to expose an HTTP(S) service.

1. Modify `frps.toml` and set the HTTP port for vhost to 8080:

  ```toml
  # frps.toml
  bindPort = 7000
  vhostHTTPPort = 8080
  ```

  If you want to configure an https proxy, you need to set up the `vhost_https_port`.

2. Start `frps`:

  `./frps -c ./frps.toml`

3. Modify `frpc.toml` and set `serverAddr` to the IP address of the remote frps server. Specify the `localPort` of your web service:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = "x.x.x.x"
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = "web"
  type = "http"
  localPort = 80
  customDomains = ["www.example.com"]
  ```

4. Start `frpc`:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.toml`

5. Map the A record of `www.example.com` to either the public IP of the remote frps server or a CNAME record pointing to your original domain.

6. Visit your local web service using url `http://www.example.com:8080`.

### Forward DNS query requests

1. Modify `frps.toml`:

  ```toml
  # frps.toml
  bindPort = 7000
  ```

2. Start `frps`:

  `./frps -c ./frps.toml`

3. Modify `frpc.toml` and set `serverAddr` to the IP address of the remote frps server. Forward DNS query requests to the Google Public DNS server `8.8.8.8:53`:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = "x.x.x.x"
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = "dns"
  type = "udp"
  localIP = "8.8.8.8"
  localPort = 53
  remotePort = 6000
  ```

4. Start frpc:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.toml`

5. Test DNS resolution using the `dig` command:

  `dig @x.x.x.x -p 6000 www.google.com`

### Forward Unix Domain Socket

Expose a Unix domain socket (e.g. the Docker daemon socket) as TCP.

Configure `frps` as above.

1. Start `frpc` with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = "x.x.x.x"
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = "unix_domain_socket"
  type = "tcp"
  remotePort = 6000
  [proxies.plugin]
  type = "unix_domain_socket"
  unixPath = "/var/run/docker.sock"
  ```

2. Test the configuration by getting the docker version using `curl`:

  `curl http://x.x.x.x:6000/version`

### Expose a simple HTTP file server

Expose a simple HTTP file server to access files stored in the LAN from the public Internet.

Configure `frps` as described above, then:

1. Start `frpc` with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = "x.x.x.x"
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = "test_static_file"
  type = "tcp"
  remotePort = 6000
  [proxies.plugin]
  type = "static_file"
  localPath = "/tmp/files"
  stripPrefix = "static"
  httpUser = "abc"
  httpPassword = "abc"
  ```

2. Visit `http://x.x.x.x:6000/static/` from your browser and specify correct username and password to view files in `/tmp/files` on the `frpc` machine.

### Enable HTTPS for a local HTTP(S) service

You may substitute `https2https` for the plugin, and point the `plugin_local_addr` to a HTTPS endpoint.

1. Start `frpc` with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = "x.x.x.x"
  serverPort = 7000
  vhostHTTPSPort = 443

  [[proxies]]
  name = "test_https2http"
  type = "https"
  customDomains = ["test.example.com"]

  [proxies.plugin]
  type = "https2http"
  localAddr = "127.0.0.1:80"
  crtPath = "./server.crt"
  keyPath = "./server.key"
  hostHeaderRewrite = "127.0.0.1"
  requestHeaders.set.x-from-where = "frp"
  ```

2. Visit `https://test.example.com`.

### Expose your service privately

To mitigate risks associated with exposing certain services directly to the public network, STCP (Secret TCP) mode requires a preshared key to be used for access to the service from other clients.

Configure `frps` same as above.

1. Start `frpc` on machine B with the following config. This example is for exposing the SSH service (port 22), and note the `sk` field for the preshared key, and that the `remote_port` field is removed here:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = "x.x.x.x"
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = "secret_ssh"
  type = "stcp"
  secretKey = "abcdefg"
  localIP = "127.0.0.1"
  localPort = 22
  ```

2. Start another `frpc` (typically on another machine C) with the following config to access the SSH service with a security key (`sk` field):

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = "x.x.x.x"
  serverPort = 7000

  [[visitors]]
  name = "secret_ssh_visitor"
  type = "stcp"
  serverName = "secret_ssh"
  secretKey = "abcdefg"
  bindAddr = "127.0.0.1"
  bindPort = 6000
  ```

3. On machine C, connect to SSH on machine B, using this command:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 127.0.0.1`

### P2P Mode

**xtcp** is designed to transmit large amounts of data directly between clients. A frps server is still needed, as P2P here only refers to the actual data transmission.

Note that it may not work with all types of NAT devices. You might want to fallback to stcp if xtcp doesn't work.

1. Start `frpc` on machine B, and expose the SSH port. Note that the `remotePort` field is removed:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = "x.x.x.x"
  serverPort = 7000
  # set up a new stun server if the default one is not available.
  # natHoleStunServer = "xxx"

  [[proxies]]
  name = "p2p_ssh"
  type = "xtcp"
  secretKey = "abcdefg"
  localIP = "127.0.0.1"
  localPort = 22
  ```

2. Start another `frpc` (typically on another machine C) with the configuration to connect to SSH using P2P mode:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = "x.x.x.x"
  serverPort = 7000
  # set up a new stun server if the default one is not available.
  # natHoleStunServer = "xxx"

  [[visitors]]
  name = "p2p_ssh_visitor"
  type = "xtcp"
  serverName = "p2p_ssh"
  secretKey = "abcdefg"
  bindAddr = "127.0.0.1"
  bindPort = 6000
  # when automatic tunnel persistence is required, set it to true
  keepTunnelOpen = false
  ```

3. On machine C, connect to SSH on machine B, using this command:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 127.0.0.1`

## Features

### Configuration Files

Since v0.52.0, we support TOML, YAML, and JSON for configuration. Please note that INI is deprecated and will be removed in future releases. New features will only be available in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Users wanting these new features should switch their configuration format accordingly.

Read the full example configuration files to find out even more features not described here.

Examples use TOML format, but you can still use YAML or JSON.

[Full configuration file for frps (Server)](./conf/frps.toml)

[Full configuration file for frpc (Client)](./conf/frpc.toml)

### Using Environment Variables

Environment variables can be referenced in the configuration file, using Go's standard format:

```toml
# frpc.toml
serverAddr = "{{ .Envs.FRP_SERVER_ADDR }}"
serverPort = 7000

[[proxies]]
name = "ssh"
type = "tcp"
localIP = "127.0.0.1"
localPort = 22
remotePort = "{{ .Envs.FRP_SSH_REMOTE_PORT }}"
```

With the config above, variables can be passed into `frpc` program like this:

```
export FRP_SERVER_ADDR=x.x.x.x
export FRP_SSH_REMOTE_PORT=6000
./frpc -c ./frpc.toml
```

`frpc` will render configuration file template using OS environment variables. Remember to prefix your reference with `.Envs`.

### Split Configures Into Different Files

You can split multiple proxy configs into different files and include them in the main file.

```toml
# frpc.toml
serverAddr = "x.x.x.x"
serverPort = 7000
includes = ["./confd/*.toml"]
```

```toml
# ./confd/test.toml
[[proxies]]
name = "ssh"
type = "tcp"
localIP = "127.0.0.1"
localPort = 22
remotePort = 6000
```

### Server Dashboard

Check frp's status and proxies' statistics information by Dashboard.

Configure a port for dashboard to enable this feature:

```toml
webServer.port = 7500
# dashboard's username and password are both optional
webServer.user = "admin"
webServer.password = "admin"
```

Then visit `http://[server_addr]:7500` to see the dashboard, with username and password both being `admin`.

Additionally, you can use HTTPS port by using your domains wildcard or normal SSL certificate:

```toml
webServer.port = 7500
# dashboard's username and password are both optional
webServer.user = "admin"
webServer.password = "admin"
webServer.tls.certFile = "server.crt"
webServer.tls.keyFile = "server.key"
```

Then visit `https://[server_addr]:7500` to see the dashboard in secure HTTPS connection, with username and password both being `admin`.

![dashboard](/doc/pic/dashboard.png)

### Client Admin UI

The Client Admin UI helps you check and manage frpc's configuration.

Configure an address for admin UI to enable this feature:

```toml
webServer.addr = "127.0.0.1"
webServer.port = 7400
webServer.user = "admin"
webServer.password = "admin"
```

Then visit `http://127.0.0.1:7400` to see admin UI, with username and password both being `admin`.

### Monitor

When web server is enabled, frps will save monitor data in cache for 7 days. It will be cleared after process restart.

Prometheus is also supported.

#### Prometheus

Enable dashboard first, then configure `enablePrometheus = true` in `frps.toml`.

`http://{dashboard_addr}/metrics` will provide prometheus monitor data.

### Authenticating the Client

There are 2 authentication methods to authenticate frpc with frps. 

You can decide which one to use by configuring `auth.method` in `frpc.toml` and `frps.toml`, the default one is token.

Configuring `auth.additionalScopes = ["HeartBeats"]` will use the configured authentication method to add and validate authentication on every heartbeat between frpc and frps.

Configuring `auth.additionalScopes = ["NewWorkConns"]` will do the same for every new work connection between frpc and frps.

#### Token Authentication

When specifying `auth.method = "token"` in `frpc.toml` and `frps.toml` - token based authentication will be used.

Make sure to specify the same `auth.token` in `frps.toml` and `frpc.toml` for frpc to pass frps validation

#### OIDC Authentication

When specifying `auth.method = "oidc"` in `frpc.toml` and `frps.toml` - OIDC based authentication will be used.

OIDC stands for OpenID Connect, and the flow used is called [Client Credentials Grant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4).

To use this authentication type - configure `frpc.toml` and `frps.toml` as follows:

```toml
# frps.toml
auth.method = "oidc"
auth.oidc.issuer = "https://example-oidc-issuer.com/"
auth.oidc.audience = "https://oidc-audience.com/.default"
```

```toml
# frpc.toml
auth.method = "oidc"
auth.oidc.clientID = "98692467-37de-409a-9fac-bb2585826f18" # Replace with OIDC client ID
auth.oidc.clientSecret = "oidc_secret"
auth.oidc.audience = "https://oidc-audience.com/.default"
auth.oidc.tokenEndpointURL = "https://example-oidc-endpoint.com/oauth2/v2.0/token"
```

### Encryption and Compression

The features are off by default. You can turn on encryption and/or compression:

```toml
# frpc.toml
[[proxies]]
name = "ssh"
type = "tcp"
localPort = 22
remotePort = 6000
transport.useEncryption = true
transport.useCompression = true
```

#### TLS

Since v0.50.0, the default value of `transport.tls.enable` and `transport.tls.disableCustomTLSFirstByte` has been changed to true, and tls is enabled by default.

For port multiplexing, frp sends a first byte `0x17` to dial a TLS connection. This only takes effect when you set `transport.tls.disableCustomTLSFirstByte` to false.

To **enforce** `frps` to only accept TLS connections - configure `transport.tls.force = true` in `frps.toml`. **This is optional.**

**`frpc` TLS settings:**

```toml
transport.tls.enable = true
transport.tls.certFile = "certificate.crt"
transport.tls.keyFile = "certificate.key"
transport.tls.trustedCaFile = "ca.crt"
```

**`frps` TLS settings:**

```toml
transport.tls.force = true
transport.tls.certFile = "certificate.crt"
transport.tls.keyFile = "certificate.key"
transport.tls.trustedCaFile = "ca.crt"
```

You will need **a root CA cert** and **at least one SSL/TLS certificate**. It **can** be self-signed or regular (such as Let's Encrypt or another SSL/TLS certificate provider).

If you using `frp` via IP address and not hostname, make sure to set the appropriate IP address in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) area when generating SSL/TLS Certificates.

Given an example:

* Prepare openssl config file. It exists at `/etc/pki/tls/openssl.cnf` in Linux System and `/System/Library/OpenSSL/openssl.cnf` in MacOS, and you can copy it to current path, like `cp /etc/pki/tls/openssl.cnf ./my-openssl.cnf`. If not, you can build it by yourself, like:
```
cat > my-openssl.cnf << EOF
[ ca ]
default_ca = CA_default
[ CA_default ]
x509_extensions = usr_cert
[ req ]
default_bits        = 2048
default_md          = sha256
default_keyfile     = privkey.pem
distinguished_name  = req_distinguished_name
attributes          = req_attributes
x509_extensions     = v3_ca
string_mask         = utf8only
[ req_distinguished_name ]
[ req_attributes ]
[ usr_cert ]
basicConstraints       = CA:FALSE
nsComment              = "OpenSSL Generated Certificate"
subjectKeyIdentifier   = hash
authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid,issuer
[ v3_ca ]
subjectKeyIdentifier   = hash
authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid:always,issuer
basicConstraints       = CA:true
EOF
```

* build ca certificates:
```
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca.key -subj "/CN=example.ca.com" -days 5000 -out ca.crt
```

* build frps certificates:
```
openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048

openssl req -new -sha256 -key server.key \
    -subj "/C=XX/ST=DEFAULT/L=DEFAULT/O=DEFAULT/CN=server.com" \
    -reqexts SAN \
    -config <(cat my-openssl.cnf <(printf "\n[SAN]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1,DNS:example.server.com")) \
    -out server.csr

openssl x509 -req -days 365 -sha256 \
	-in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial \
	-extfile <(printf "subjectAltName=DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1,DNS:example.server.com") \
	-out server.crt
```

* build frpc certificates：
```
openssl genrsa -out client.key 2048
openssl req -new -sha256 -key client.key \
    -subj "/C=XX/ST=DEFAULT/L=DEFAULT/O=DEFAULT/CN=client.com" \
    -reqexts SAN \
    -config <(cat my-openssl.cnf <(printf "\n[SAN]\nsubjectAltNa
