##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

# Quick Start

This will quickly go over the parts of using FlatBuffers to serialize some data.
See the [Tutorial](tutorial.md) for a more in depth guide.

1. **Build the compiler for FlatBuffers ([`flatc`](flatc.md))**

    ```sh
    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"
    make -j
    ```

2. **Define your FlatBuffer [schema](schema.md) (`.fbs`)**

    ```c title="monster.fbs" linenums="1"
    table Monster {
      name:string;
      health:int;
    }

    root_type Monster;
    ```

    See [monster.fbs](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/blob/master/samples/monster.fbs)
    for an complete example.

3. **Generate code for your language(s)**

    Use the `flatc` compiler to take your schema and generate language-specific
    code:

    ```sh
    ./flatc --cpp --rust monster.fbs
    ```

    Which generates `monster_generated.h` and `monster_generated.rs` files.

4. **Serialize data**

    Use the generated code files, as well as the `FlatBufferBuilder` to construct
    your serialized buffer.

    ```c++ title="my_monster_factory.cc" linenums="1"
    #include "flatbuffers.h"
    #include "monster_generated.h"

    int main() { 
      // Used to build the flatbuffer
      FlatBufferBuilder builder;

      // Auto-generated function emitted from `flatc` and the input 
      // `monster.fbs` schema.
      auto monster = CreateMonsterDirect(builder, "Abominable Snowman", 100);

      // Finalize the buffer.
      builder.Finish(monster);
    }
    ```

    See complete [C++ Example](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/blob/master/samples/sample_binary.cpp#L24-L56).

5.  **Transmit/Store the serialized FlatBuffer**
  
    Use your serialized buffer however you want. Send it to someone, save if for
    later, etc...

    ```c++ title="my_monster_factory.cc" linenums="13"
    // Get a pointer to the flatbuffer.
    const uint8_t* flatbuffer = builder.GetBufferPointer();
    ```

6.  **Read the data**

    Use the generated accessors to read the data from the serialized buffer.

    It doesn't need to be the same language, or even schema version (see 
    [Evolving](evolution.md)), FlatBuffers ensures the data is readable across
    languages and schema versions. 
    
    ```c++ title="my_monster_factory.cc" linenums="15"
    // Get a view of the root monster from the flatbuffer.
    const Monster snowman = GetMonster(flatbuffer);

    // Access the monster's fields directly.
    ASSERT_EQ(snowman->name(), "Abominable Snowman");
    ASSERT_EQ(snowman->health(), 100);
    ```    
    
    See [`Rust` examples](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/blob/master/samples/sample_binary.rs#L92-L106)
    for reading the data written by `C++`.
