Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

### File:
------ START FILE test-jpms/README.md ------
# test-jpms

This Maven module contains tests to verify that Gson's `module-info.class` which is used by the Java Platform Module System (JPMS) works properly and can be used by other projects. The module declaration file `src/test/java/module-info.java` uses Gson's module.

This is a separate Maven module to test Gson's final JAR instead of just the compiled classes.
