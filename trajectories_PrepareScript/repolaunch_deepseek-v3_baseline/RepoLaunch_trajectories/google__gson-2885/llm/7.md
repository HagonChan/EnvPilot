##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

### File:
------ START FILE .github/workflows/check-api-compatibility.yml ------
# This workflow makes sure that a pull request does not make any incompatible changes
# to the public API of Gson
name: Check API compatibility

on: pull_request
permissions:
  contents: read #  to fetch code (actions/checkout)

jobs:
  check-api-compatibility:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # This setup tries to determine API incompatibility only for the changes introduced by the
    # pull request. It does this by first checking out the 'old' version and installing it into
    # the local Maven repository before then using japicmp to compare it to the current changes.
    #
    # Alternatively it would also be possible to compare against the last release version instead.
    #
    # Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, see description of
    # https://github.com/google/gson/pull/2692 for details.
