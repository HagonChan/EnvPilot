##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to install dependencies and set up a environment that is able to run the tests of the project.

- You start with an initial Docker container based on ubuntu:22.04.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- No need to clone the project again.

The final objective is to successfully run the tests of the project.


### Python-Specific Instructions:
- Make sure the package is installed from source in editable mode before running tests (e.g., `pip install -e .`)
- Avoid using tox to run tests if possible as it's designed for CI. Read tox.ini to understand setup
- Check requirements.txt, setup.py, or pyproject.toml for dependencies


================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

    Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
        <command>bash command</command>
        e.g. install build-essential: <command>apt-get install -y build-essential</command>
        e.g. view file content: <command>cat README.md</command>
    Search: search the web for if you need some information, generate query and reply with following format:
        <search>the search query</search>
        e.g. <search>how to fix 'No module named setuptools'</search>
        e.g. <search>how to install python3 on ubuntu</search>
        e.g. <search>how to create development environment for python3</search>
    Stop: stop the setup loop once you think the setup is complete, reply with following format:
        <stop></stop>
    

Observation will be the result of running those actions.


Project Structure: the structure of the project, including files and directories.
Related Files: the content of related files of the project that may help you understand the project.
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: <command>your bash command here</command> or <search>your search query</search> or other actions available
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) ...
Thought: I think the setup should be fine
Action: <stop>stop the setup</stop>
Answer: the final result

=======================
Installing scikit-learn
=======================

.. note::

    If you wish to contribute to the project, it's recommended you
    :ref:`install the latest development version<install_bleeding_edge>`.


Installing the latest release
=============================

Scikit-learn requires:

- Python (>= 2.7 or >= 3.4),
- NumPy (>= 1.8.2),
- SciPy (>= 0.13.3).

If you already have a working installation of numpy and scipy,
the easiest way to install scikit-learn is using ``pip`` ::

    pip install -U scikit-learn

or ``conda``::

    conda install scikit-learn

If you have not installed NumPy or SciPy yet, you can also install these using
conda or pip. When using pip, please ensure that *binary wheels* are used,
and NumPy and SciPy are not recompiled from source, which can happen when using
particular configurations of operating system and hardware (such as Linux on
a Raspberry Pi). 
Building numpy and scipy from source can be complex (especially on Windows) and
requires careful configuration to ensure that they link against an optimized
implementation of linear algebra routines.
Instead, use a third-party distribution as described below.

If you must install scikit-learn and its dependencies with pip, you can install
it as ``scikit-learn[alldeps]``. The most common use case for this is in a
``requirements.txt`` file used as part of an automated build process for a PaaS
application or a Docker image. This option is not intended for manual
installation from the command line.

Third-party Distributions
==========================
If you don't already have a python installation with numpy and scipy, we
recommend to install either via your package manager or via a python bundle.
These come with numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib and many other helpful
scientific and data processing libraries.

Available options are:

Canopy and Anaconda for all supported platforms
-----------------------------------------------

`Canopy
<https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy>`_ and `Anaconda
<https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_ both ship a recent
version of scikit-learn, in addition to a large set of scientific python
library for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.

Anaconda offers scikit-learn as part of its free distribution.


.. warning::

    To upgrade or uninstall scikit-learn installed with Anaconda
    or ``conda`` you **should not use the pip command**. Instead:

    To upgrade ``scikit-learn``::

        conda update scikit-learn

    To uninstall ``scikit-learn``::

        conda remove scikit-learn

    Upgrading with ``pip install -U scikit-learn`` or uninstalling
    ``pip uninstall scikit-learn`` is likely fail to properly remove files
    installed by the ``conda`` command.

    pip upgrade and uninstall operations only work on packages installed
    via ``pip install``.


WinPython for Windows
-----------------------

The `WinPython <https://winpython.github.io/>`_ project distributes
scikit-learn as an additional plugin.


For installation instructions for particular operating systems or for compiling
the bleeding edge version, see the :ref:`advanced-installation`.

Contributing to scikit-learn
============================

**Note: This document is a 'getting started' summary for contributing code,
documentation, testing, and filing issues.** Visit the [**Contributing
page**](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html)
for the full contributor's guide. Please read it carefully to help make
the code review process go as smoothly as possible and maximize the
likelihood of your contribution being merged.

How to contribute
-----------------

The preferred workflow for contributing to scikit-learn is to fork the
[main repository](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) on
GitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:

1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)
   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates
   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on
   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

2. Clone your fork of the scikit-learn repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:

   ```bash
   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/scikit-learn.git
   $ cd scikit-learn
   ```

3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:

   ```bash
   $ git checkout -b my-feature
   ```

   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!

4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:

   ```bash
   $ git add modified_files
   $ git commit
   ```

   to record your changes in Git, then push the changes to your GitHub account with:

   ```bash
   $ git push -u origin my-feature
   ```

5. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
to create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.

(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the
[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)

Pull Request Checklist
----------------------

We recommended that your contribution complies with the
following rules before you submit a pull request:

-  Follow the
   [coding-guidelines](http://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html#coding-guidelines).

-  Use, when applicable, the validation tools and scripts in the
   `sklearn.utils` submodule.  A list of utility routines available
   for developers can be found in the
   [Utilities for Developers](http://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/utilities.html#developers-utils)
   page.

-  Give your pull request a helpful title that summarises what your
   contribution does. In some cases `Fix <ISSUE TITLE>` is enough.
   `Fix #<ISSUE NUMBER>` is not enough.

-  Often pull requests resolve one or more other issues (or pull requests).
   If merging your pull request means that some other issues/PRs should
   be closed, you should
   [use keywords to create link to them](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests/)
   (e.g., `Fixes #1234`; multiple issues/PRs are allowed as long as each one
   is preceded by a keyword). Upon merging, those issues/PRs will
   automatically be closed by GitHub. If your pull request is simply related
   to some other issues/PRs, create a link to them without using the keywords
   (e.g., `See also #1234`).

-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample
   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.

-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` (Ready for
   Merge), if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review.
   Two core developers will review your code and change the prefix of the pull
   request to `[MRG + 1]` and `[MRG + 2]` on approval, making it eligible
   for merging. An incomplete contribution -- where you expect to do more work before
   receiving a full review -- should be prefixed `[WIP]` (to indicate a work
   in progress) and changed to `[MRG]` when it matures. WIPs may be useful
   to: indicate you are working on something to avoid duplicated work,
   request broad review of functionality or API, or seek collaborators.
   WIPs often benefit from the inclusion of a
   [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)
   in the PR description.

-  All other tests pass when everything is rebuilt from scratch. On
   Unix-like systems, check with (from the toplevel source folder):

      ```bash
      $ make
      ```

-  When adding additional functionality, provide at least one
   example script in the ``examples/`` folder. Have a look at other
   examples for reference. Examples should demonstrate why the new
   functionality is useful in practice and, if possible, compare it
   to other methods available in scikit-learn.

-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to be
   accepted. Bug-fixes or new features should be provided with 
   [non-regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-regression_testing).
   These tests verify the correct behavior of the fix or feature. In this
   manner, further modifications on the code base are granted to be consistent
   with the desired behavior.
   For the Bug-fixes case, at the time of the PR, this tests should fail for
   the code base in master and pass for the PR code.


-  At least one paragraph of narrative documentation with links to
   references in the literature (with PDF links when possible) and
   the example.

-  The documentation should also include expected time and space
   complexity of the algorithm and scalability, e.g. "this algorithm
   can scale to a large number of samples > 100000, but does not
   scale in dimensionality: n_features is expected to be lower than
   100".

You can also check for common programming errors with the following
tools:

-  Code with good unittest **coverage** (at least 80%), check with:

  ```bash
  $ pip install pytest pytest-cov
  $ pytest --cov sklearn path/to/tests_for_package
  ```

-  No pyflakes warnings, check with:

  ```bash
  $ pip install pyflakes
  $ pyflakes path/to/module.py
  ```

-  No PEP8 warnings, check with:

  ```bash
  $ pip install pep8
  $ pep8 path/to/module.py
  ```

-  AutoPEP8 can help you fix some of the easy redundant errors:

  ```bash
  $ pip install autopep8
  $ autopep8 path/to/pep8.py
  ```

Bonus points for contributions that include a performance analysis with
a benchmark script and profiling output (please report on the mailing
list or on the GitHub issue).

Filing bugs
-----------
We use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to
open an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.

It is recommended to check that your issue complies with the
following rules before submitting:

-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other
   [issues](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues?q=)
   or [pull requests](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pulls?q=).

-  If you are submitting an algorithm or feature request, please verify that
   the algorithm fulfills our
   [new algorithm requirements](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/faq.html#what-are-the-inclusion-criteria-for-new-algorithms).

-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in
   appropriate code blocks.
   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).

-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well
   as your Python, scikit-learn, numpy, and scipy versions. This information
   can be found by running the following code snippet:

  ```python
  import platform; print(platform.platform())
  import sys; print("Python", sys.version)
  import numpy; print("NumPy", numpy.__version__)
  import scipy; print("SciPy", scipy.__version__)
  import sklearn; print("Scikit-Learn", sklearn.__version__)
  ```

-  Please be specific about what estimators and/or functions are involved
   and the shape of the data, as appropriate; please include a
   [reproducible](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) code snippet
   or link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com). If an exception is raised,
   please provide the traceback.

New contributor tips
--------------------

A great way to start contributing to scikit-learn is to pick an item from the
list of
[good first issues](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/labels/good%20first%20issue). If
you have already contributed to scikit-learn look at
[Easy issues](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/labels/Easy)
instead. Resolving these issues allow you to start contributing to the project
without much prior knowledge. Your assistance in this area will be greatly
appreciated by the more experienced developers as it helps free up their time to
concentrate on other issues.

Documentation
-------------

We are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,
reStructuredText documents (like this one), tutorials, etc.
reStructuredText documents live in the source code repository under the
doc/ directory.

You can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate
the HTML output by typing ``make html`` from the doc/ directory.
Alternatively, ``make`` can be used to quickly generate the
documentation without the example gallery. The resulting HTML files will
be placed in ``_build/html/`` and are viewable in a web browser. See the
``README`` file in the ``doc/`` directory for more information.

For building the documentation, you will need
[sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/),
[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and
[pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

When you are writing documentation, it is important to keep a good
compromise between mathematical and algorithmic details, and give
intuition to the reader on what the algorithm does. It is best to always
start with a small paragraph with a hand-waving explanation of what the
method does to the data and a figure (coming from an example)
illustrating it.

scikit-learn
============

scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning built on top of
SciPy and distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

The project was started in 2007 by David Cournapeau as a Google Summer
of Code project, and since then many volunteers have contributed. See
the `AUTHORS.rst <AUTHORS.rst>`_ file for a complete list of contributors.

It is currently maintained by a team of volunteers.

Website: http://scikit-learn.org


Installation
------------

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

scikit-learn requires:

- Python (>= 2.7 or >= 3.4)
- NumPy (>= 1.8.2)
- SciPy (>= 0.13.3)

For running the examples Matplotlib >= 1.3.1 is required.

scikit-learn also uses CBLAS, the C interface to the Basic Linear Algebra
Subprograms library. scikit-learn comes with a reference implementation, but
the system CBLAS will be detected by the build system and used if present.
CBLAS exists in many implementations; see `Linear algebra libraries
<http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/computational_performance.html#linear-algebra-libraries>`_
for known issues.

User installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you already have a working installation of numpy and scipy,
the easiest way to install scikit-learn is using ``pip`` ::

    pip install -U scikit-learn

or ``conda``::

    conda install scikit-learn

The documentation includes more detailed `installation instructions <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html>`_.


Development
-----------

We welcome new contributors of all experience levels. The scikit-learn
community goals are to be helpful, welcoming, and effective. The
`Development Guide <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/index.html>`_

Thought: The error suggests there's a Cython compilation issue with the scikit-learn package. This might be due to version incompatibilities. I should check the required Cython version and install the correct one.

Action: <command>pip3 install "cython<3.0" && pip3 install -e .</command>
