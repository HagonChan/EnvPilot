##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

### File:
------ START FILE build_tools/appveyor/requirements.txt ------
# Fetch numpy and scipy wheels from the sklearn rackspace wheelhouse.
# Those wheels were collected from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
# This is a temporary solution. As soon as numpy and scipy provide official
# wheel for windows we ca delete this --find-links line.
