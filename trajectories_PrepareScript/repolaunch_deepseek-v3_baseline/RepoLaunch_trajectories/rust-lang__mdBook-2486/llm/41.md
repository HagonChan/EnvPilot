##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to install dependencies and set up a environment that is able to run the tests of the project.

- You start with an initial Docker container based on ubuntu:22.04.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- No need to clone the project again.

The final objective is to successfully run the tests of the project.


### Rust-Specific Instructions:
- Use `cargo build` to build the project
- Use `cargo test` to run tests
- Use `cargo check` for faster compilation checks
- Install system dependencies if needed (check Cargo.toml for sys crates)
- Consider using `cargo install` for binary dependencies


================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

    Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
        <command>bash command</command>
        e.g. install build-essential: <command>apt-get install -y build-essential</command>
        e.g. view file content: <command>cat README.md</command>
    Search: search the web for if you need some information, generate query and reply with following format:
        <search>the search query</search>
        e.g. <search>how to fix 'No module named setuptools'</search>
        e.g. <search>how to install python3 on ubuntu</search>
        e.g. <search>how to create development environment for python3</search>
    Stop: stop the setup loop once you think the setup is complete, reply with following format:
        <stop></stop>
    

Observation will be the result of running those actions.


Project Structure: the structure of the project, including files and directories.
Related Files: the content of related files of the project that may help you understand the project.
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: <command>your bash command here</command> or <search>your search query</search> or other actions available
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) ...
Thought: I think the setup should be fine
Action: <stop>stop the setup</stop>
Answer: the final result

# Contributing

Welcome stranger!

If you have come here to learn how to contribute to mdBook, we have some tips for you!

First of all, don't hesitate to ask questions!
Use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues), no question is too simple.

### Issue assignment

**:warning: Important :warning:**

Before working on pull request, please ping us on the corresponding issue.
The current PR backlog is beyond what we can process at this time.
Only issues that have an [`E-Help-wanted`](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/labels/E-Help-wanted) or [`Feature accepted`](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/labels/Feature%20accepted) label will likely receive reviews.
If there isn't already an open issue for what you want to work on, please open one first to see if it is something we would be available to review.

### Issues to work on

If you are starting out, you might be interested in the
[E-Easy issues](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AE-Easy).
Those are issues that are considered more straightforward for beginners to Rust or the codebase itself.
These issues can be a good launching pad for more involved issues.
Easy tasks for a first time contribution include documentation improvements, new tests, examples, updating dependencies, etc.

If you come from a web development background, you might be interested in issues related to web technologies tagged
[A-JavaScript](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AA-JavaScript),
[A-Style](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AA-Style),
[A-HTML](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AA-HTML) or
[A-Mobile](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AA-Mobile).

When you decide you want to work on a specific issue, and it isn't already assigned to someone else, assign the issue to yourself by leaving a comment with the text `@rustbot claim`.
Again, do not hesitate to ask questions. We will gladly mentor anyone that want to tackle an issue.

Issues on the issue tracker are categorized with the following labels:

- **A**-prefixed labels state which area of the project an issue relates to.
- **E**-prefixed labels show an estimate of the experience necessary to fix the issue.

- **S**-prefixed labels show the status of the issue
- **C**-prefixed labels show the category of issue

### Building mdBook

mdBook builds on stable Rust, if you want to build mdBook from source, here are the steps to follow:

1. Navigate to the directory of your choice
0. Clone this repository with git.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook.git
   ```
0. Navigate into the newly created `mdBook` directory
0. Run `cargo build`

The resulting binary can be found in `mdBook/target/debug/` under the name `mdbook` or `mdbook.exe`.

### Code Quality

We love code quality and Rust has some excellent tools to assist you with contributions.

#### Formatting Code with rustfmt

Before you make your Pull Request to the project, please run it through the `rustfmt` utility.
This will ensure we have good quality source code that is better for us all to maintain.

[rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) has a lot more information on the project.
The quick guide is

1. Install it (`rustfmt` is usually installed by default via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)):
    ```
    rustup component add rustfmt
    ```
1. You can now run `rustfmt` on a single file simply by...
    ```
    rustfmt src/path/to/your/file.rs
    ```
   ... or you can format the entire project with
   ```
   cargo fmt
   ```
   When run through `cargo` it will format all bin and lib files in the current package.

For more information, such as running it from your favourite editor, please see the `rustfmt` project. [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt)


#### Finding Issues with Clippy

[Clippy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/) is a code analyser/linter detecting mistakes, and therefore helps to improve your code.
Like formatting your code with `rustfmt`, running clippy regularly and before your Pull Request will help us maintain awesome code.

1. To install
    ```
    rustup component add clippy
    ```
2. Running clippy
    ```
    cargo clippy
    ```

### Change requirements

Please consider the following when making a change:

* Almost all changes that modify the Rust code must be accompanied with a test.

* Almost all features and changes must update the documentation.
  mdBook has the [mdBook Guide](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) whose source is at <https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/tree/master/guide>.

* Almost all Rust items should be documented with doc comments.
  See the [Rustdoc Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/) for more information on writing doc comments.

* Breaking the API can only be done in major SemVer releases.
  These are done very infrequently, so it is preferred to avoid these when possible.
  See [SemVer Compatibility](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/semver.html) for more information on what a SemVer breaking change is.

  (Note: At this time, some SemVer breaking changes are inevitable due to the current code structure.
  An example is adding new fields to the config structures.
  These are intended to be fixed in the next major release.)

* Similarly, the CLI interface is considered to be stable.
  Care should be taken to avoid breaking existing workflows.

* Check out the [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/) for guidelines on designing the API.

### Making a pull-request

When you feel comfortable that your changes could be integrated into mdBook, you can create a pull-request on GitHub.
One of the core maintainers will then approve the changes or request some changes before it gets merged.

That's it, happy contributions! :tada: :tada: :tada:

## Browser compatibility and testing

Currently we don't have a strict browser compatibility matrix due to our limited resources.
We generally strive to keep mdBook compatible with a relatively recent browser on all of the most major platforms.
That is, supporting Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.
If possible, do your best to avoid breaking older browser releases.

Any change to the HTML or styling is encouraged to manually check on as many browsers and platforms that you can.
Unfortunately at this time we don't have any automated UI or browser testing, so your assistance in testing is appreciated.

## Updating highlight.js

The following are instructions for updating [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/).

1. Clone the repository at <https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js>
1. Check out a tagged release (like `10.1.1`).
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `node tools/build.js :common apache armasm coffeescript d handlebars haskell http julia nginx nim nix properties r scala x86asm yaml`
1. Compare the language list that it spits out to the one in [`syntax-highlighting.md`](https://github.com/camelid/mdBook/blob/master/guide/src/format/theme/syntax-highlighting.md). If any are missing, add them to the list and rebuild (and update these docs). If any are added to the common set, add them to `syntax-highlighting.md`.
1. Copy `build/highlight.min.js` to mdbook's directory [`highlight.js`](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/blob/master/src/theme/highlight.js).
1. Be sure to check the highlight.js [CHANGES](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/blob/main/CHANGES.md) for any breaking changes. Breaking changes that would affect users will need to wait until the next major release.
1. Build mdbook with the new file and build some books with the new version and compare the output with a variety of languages to see if anything changes. The [test_book](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/tree/master/test_book) contains a chapter with many languages to examine.

## Publishing new releases

Instructions for mdBook maintainers to publish a new release:

1. Create a PR to update the version and update the CHANGELOG:
    1. Update the version in `Cargo.toml`
    2. Run `cargo test` to verify that everything is passing, and to update `Cargo.lock`.
    3. Double-check for any SemVer breaking changes.
       Try [`cargo-semver-checks`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-semver-checks), though beware that the current version of mdBook isn't properly adhering to SemVer due to the lack of `#[non_exhaustive]` and other issues. See https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues/1835.
    4. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with any changes that users may be interested in.
    5. Update `continuous-integration.md` to update the version number for the installation instructions.
    6. Commit the changes, and open a PR.
2. After the PR has been merged, create a release in GitHub. This can either be done in the GitHub web UI, or on the command-line:
   ```bash
   MDBOOK_VERS="`cargo read-manifest | jq -r .version`" ; \
    gh release create -R rust-lang/mdbook v$MDBOOK_VERS \
        --title v$MDBOOK_VERS \
        --notes "See https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#mdbook-${MDBOOK_VERS//.} for a complete list of changes."
   ```

# Alternative Backends

A "backend" is simply a program which `mdbook` will invoke during the book
rendering process. This program is passed a JSON representation of the book and
configuration information via `stdin`. Once the backend receives this
information it is free to do whatever it wants.

See [Configuring Renderers](../format/configuration/renderers.md) for more information about using backends.

The community has developed several backends.
See the [Third Party Plugins] wiki page for a list of available backends.

## Setting Up

This page will step you through creating your own alternative backend in the form
of a simple word counting program. Although it will be written in Rust, there's
no reason why it couldn't be accomplished using something like Python or Ruby.

First you'll want to create a new binary program and add `mdbook` as a
dependency.

```shell
$ cargo new --bin mdbook-wordcount
$ cd mdbook-wordcount
$ cargo add mdbook
```

When our `mdbook-wordcount` plugin is invoked, `mdbook` will send it a JSON
version of [`RenderContext`] via our plugin's `stdin`. For convenience, there's
a [`RenderContext::from_json()`] constructor which will load a `RenderContext`.

This is all the boilerplate necessary for our backend to load the book.

```rust
// src/main.rs
extern crate mdbook;

use std::io;
use mdbook::renderer::RenderContext;

fn main() {
    let mut stdin = io::stdin();
    let ctx = RenderContext::from_json(&mut stdin).unwrap();
}
```

> **Note:** The `RenderContext` contains a `version` field. This lets backends
  figure out whether they are compatible with the version of `mdbook` it's being
  called by. This `version` comes directly from the corresponding field in
  `mdbook`'s `Cargo.toml`.

  It is recommended that backends use the [`semver`] crate to inspect this field
  and emit a warning if there may be a compatibility issue.


## Inspecting the Book

Now our backend has a copy of the book, lets count how many words are in each
chapter!

Because the `RenderContext` contains a [`Book`] field (`book`), and a `Book` has
the [`Book::iter()`] method for iterating over all items in a `Book`, this step
turns out to be just as easy as the first.

```rust

fn main() {
    let mut stdin = io::stdin();
    let ctx = RenderContext::from_json(&mut stdin).unwrap();

    for item in ctx.book.iter() {
        if let BookItem::Chapter(ref ch) = *item {
            let num_words = count_words(ch);
            println!("{}: {}", ch.name, num_words);
        }
    }
}

fn count_words(ch: &Chapter) -> usize {
    ch.content.split_whitespace().count()
}
```


## Enabling the Backend

Now we've got the basics running, we want to actually use it. First, install the
program.

```shell
$ cargo install --path .
```

Then `cd` to the particular book you'd like to count the words of and update its
`book.toml` file.

```diff
  [book]
  title = "mdBook Documentation"
  description = "Create book from markdown files. Like Gitbook but implemented in Rust"
  authors = ["Mathieu David", "Michael-F-Bryan"]

+ [output.html]

+ [output.wordcount]
```

When it loads a book into memory, `mdbook` will inspect your `book.toml` file to
try and figure out which backends to use by looking for all `output.*` tables.
If none are provided it'll fall back to using the default HTML renderer.

Notably, this means if you want to add your own custom backend you'll also need
to make sure to add the HTML backend, even if its table just stays empty.

Now you just need to build your book like normal, and everything should *Just
Work*.

```shell
$ mdbook build
...
2018-01-16 07:31:15 [INFO] (mdbook::renderer): Invoking the "mdbook-wordcount" renderer
mdBook: 126
Command Line Tool: 224
init: 283
build: 145
watch: 146
serve: 292
test: 139

Contributors: 85
```

The reason we didn't need to specify the full name/path of our `wordcount`
backend is because `mdbook` will try to *infer* the program's name via
convention. The executable for the `foo` backend is typically called
`mdbook-foo`, with an associated `[output.foo]` entry in the `book.toml`. To
explicitly tell `mdbook` what command to invoke (it may require command-line
arguments or be an interpreted script), you can use the `command` field.

```diff
  [book]
  title = "mdBook Documentation"
  description = "Create book from markdown files. Like Gitbook but implemented in Rust"
  authors = ["Mathieu David", "Michael-F-Bryan"]

  [output.html]

  [output.wordcount]
+ command = "python /path/to/wordcount.py"
```


## Configuration

Now imagine you don't want to count the number of words on a particular chapter
(it might be generated text/code, etc). The canonical way to do this is via the
usual `book.toml` configuration file by adding items to your `[output.foo]`
table.

The `Config` can be treated roughly as a nested hashmap which lets you call
methods like `get()` to access the config's contents, with a
`get_deserialized()` convenience method for retrieving a value and automatically
deserializing to some arbitrary type `T`.

To implement this, we'll create our own serializable `WordcountConfig` struct
which will encapsulate all configuration for this backend.

First add `serde` and `serde_derive` to your `Cargo.toml`,

```
$ cargo add serde serde_derive
```

And then you can create the config struct,

```rust
extern crate serde;
#[macro_use]
extern crate serde_derive;

...

#[derive(Debug, Default, Serialize, Deserialize)]
#[serde(default, rename_all = "kebab-case")]
pub struct WordcountConfig {
  pub ignores: Vec<String>,
}
```

Now we just need to deserialize the `WordcountConfig` from our `RenderContext`
and then add a check to make sure we skip ignored chapters.

```diff
  fn main() {
      let mut stdin = io::stdin();
      let ctx = RenderContext::from_json(&mut stdin).unwrap();
+     let cfg: WordcountConfig = ctx.config
+         .get_deserialized("output.wordcount")
+         .unwrap_or_default();

      for item in ctx.book.iter() {
          if let BookItem::Chapter(ref ch) = *item {
+             if cfg.ignores.contains(&ch.name) {
+                 continue;
+             }
+
              let num_words = count_words(ch);
              println!("{}: {}", ch.name, num_words);
          }
      }
  }
```


## Output and Signalling Failure

While it's nice to print word counts to the terminal when a book is built, it
might also be a good idea to output them to a file somewhere. `mdbook` tells a
backend where it should place any generated output via the `destination` field
in [`RenderContext`].

```diff
+ use std::fs::{self, File};
+ use std::io::{self, Write};
- use std::io;
  use mdbook::renderer::RenderContext;
  use mdbook::book::{BookItem, Chapter};

  fn main() {
    ...

+     let _ = fs::create_dir_all(&ctx.destination);
+     let mut f = File::create(ctx.destination.join("wordcounts.txt")).unwrap();
+
      for item in ctx.book.iter() {
          if let BookItem::Chapter(ref ch) = *item {
              ...

              let num_words = count_words(ch);
              println!("{}: {}", ch.name, num_words);
+             writeln!(f, "{}: {}", ch.name, num_words).unwrap();
          }
      }
  }
```

> **Note:** There is no guarantee that the destination directory exists or is
> empty (`mdbook` may leave the previous contents to let backends do caching),
> so it's always a good idea to create it with `fs::create_dir_all()`.
>

There's always the possibility that an error will occur while processing a book
(just look at all the `unwrap()`'s we've written already), so `mdbook` will
interpret a non-zero exit code as a rendering failure.

For example, if we wanted to make sure all chapters have an *even* number of
words, erroring out if an odd number is encountered, then you may do something
like this:

```diff
+ use std::process;
  ...

  fn main() {
      ...

      for item in ctx.book.iter() {
          if let BookItem::Chapter(ref ch) = *item {
              ...

              let num_words = count_words(ch);
              println!("{}: {}", ch.name, num_words);
              writeln!(f, "{}: {}", ch.name, num_words).unwrap();

+             if cfg.deny_odds && num_words % 2 == 1 {
+               eprintln!("{} has an odd number of words!", ch.name);
+               process::exit(1);
+             }
          }
      }
  }

  #[derive(Debug, Default, Serialize, Deserialize)]
  #[serde(default, rename_all = "kebab-case")]
  pub struct WordcountConfig {
      pub ignores: Vec<String>,
+     pub deny_odds: bool,
  }
```

Now, if we reinstall the backend and build a book,

```shell
$ cargo install --path . --force
$ mdbook build /path/to/book
...
2018-01-16 21:21:39 [INFO] (mdbook::renderer): Invoking the "wordcount" renderer
mdBook: 126
Command Line Tool: 224
init: 283
init has an odd number of words!
2018-01-16 21:21:39 [ERROR] (mdbook::renderer): Renderer exited with non-zero return code.
2018-01-16 21:21:39 [ERROR] (mdbook::utils): Error: Rendering failed
2018-01-16 21:21:39 [ERROR] (mdbook::utils):    Caused By: The "mdbook-wordcount" renderer failed
```

As you've probably already noticed, output from the plugin's subprocess is
immediately passed through to the user. It is encouraged for plugins to follow
the "rule of silence" and only generate output when necessary (e.g. an error in
generation or a warning).

All environment variables are passed through to the backend, allowing you to use
the usual `RUST_LOG` to control logging verbosity.

## Wrapping Up

Although contrived, hopefully this example was enough to show how you'd create
an alternative backend for `mdbook`. If you feel it's missing something, don't
hesitate to create an issue in the [issue tracker] so we can improve the user
guide.

The existing backends mentioned towards the start of this chapter should serve
as a good example of how it's done in real life, so feel free to skim through
the source code or ask questions.

# Installation

There are multiple ways to install the mdBook CLI tool.
Choose any one of the methods below that best suit your needs.
If you are installing mdBook for automatic deployment, check out the [continuous integration] chapter for more examples on how to install.

[continuous integration]: ../continuous-integration.md

## Pre-compiled binaries

Executable binaries are available for download on the [GitHub Releases page][releases].
Download the binary for your platform (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and extract the archive.
The archive contains an `mdbook` executable which you can run to build your books.

To make it easier to run, put the path to the binary into your `PATH`.

[releases]: https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/releases

## Build from source using Rust

To build the `mdbook` executable from source, you will first need to install Rust and Cargo.
Follow the instructions on the [Rust installation page].
mdBook currently requires at least Rust version 1.74.

Once you have installed Rust, the following command can be used to build and install mdBook:

```sh
cargo install mdbook
```

This will automatically download mdBook from [crates.io], build it, and install it in Cargo's global binary directory (`~/.cargo/bin/` by default).

You can run `cargo install mdbook` again whenever you want to update to a new version.
That command will check if there is a newer version, and re-install mdBook if a newer version is found.

To uninstall, run the command `cargo uninstall mdbook`.

[Rust installation page]: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
[crates.io]: https://crates.io/

### Installing the latest master version

The version published to crates.io will ever so slightly be behind the version hosted on GitHub.
If you need the latest version you can build the git version of mdBook yourself.
Cargo makes this ***super easy***!

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook.git mdbook
```

Again, make sure to add the Cargo bin directory to your `PATH`.

## Modifying and contributing

If you are interested in making modifications to mdBook itself, check out the [Contributing Guide] for more information.
