.TH fzf\-tmux 1 "Feb 2025" "fzf 0.59.0" "fzf\-tmux - open fzf in tmux split pane"

.SH NAME
fzf\-tmux - open fzf in tmux split pane

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fzf\-tmux [\fILAYOUT OPTIONS\fR] [\-\-] [\fIFZF OPTIONS\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
fzf\-tmux is a wrapper script for fzf that opens fzf in a tmux split pane or in
a tmux popup window. It is designed to work just like fzf except that it does
not take up the whole screen. You can safely use fzf\-tmux instead of fzf in
your scripts as the extra options will be silently ignored if you're not on
tmux.
