##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

Release Procedure
-----------------

Our current policy for releasing is to aim for a bugfix every few weeks and a minor release every 2-3 months. The idea
is to get fixes and new features out instead of trying to cram a ton of features into a release and by consequence
taking a lot of time to make a new one.

.. important::

    pytest releases must be prepared on **Linux** because the docs and examples expect
    to be executed in that platform.

#. Create a branch ``release-X.Y.Z`` with the version for the release.

   * **patch releases**: from the latest ``master``;

   * **minor releases**: from the latest ``features``; then merge with the latest ``master``;

   Ensure your are in a clean work tree.

#. Using ``tox``, generate docs, changelog, announcements::

    $ tox -e release -- <VERSION>

   This will generate a commit with all the changes ready for pushing.

#. Open a PR for this branch targeting ``master``.

#. After all tests pass and the PR has been approved, publish to PyPI by pushing the tag::

     git tag <VERSION>
     git push git@github.com:pytest-dev/pytest.git <VERSION>

   Wait for the deploy to complete, then make sure it is `available on PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pytest>`_.

#. Merge the PR into ``master``.

#. Send an email announcement with the contents from::

     doc/en/announce/release-<VERSION>.rst

   To the following mailing lists:

   * pytest-dev@python.org (all releases)
   * python-announce-list@python.org (all releases)
   * testing-in-python@lists.idyll.org (only major/minor releases)

   And announce it on `Twitter <https://twitter.com/>`_ with the ``#pytest`` hashtag.
