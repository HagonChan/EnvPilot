##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

### File:
------ START FILE dependencies/png/CMakeLists.txt ------
if (APPLE)
    # This changes how find_xxx() commands work; the default is to find frameworks before
    # standard libraries or headers, but this can be a problem on systems that have Mono
    # installed, as it has a framework with the libjpeg and libpng  headers present -- so
    # CMake finds the headers from Mono but the libraries from Homebrew, and hilarity ensues.
    # Setting this to "last" means we always try the standard libraries before the frameworks.
    set(CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK LAST)
endif ()

find_package(PNG)
if (TARGET PNG::PNG)
    set_target_properties(PNG::PNG PROPERTIES IMPORTED_GLOBAL TRUE)
endif ()
------ END FILE dependencies/png/CMakeLists.txt ------
