##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to install dependencies and set up a environment that is able to run the tests of the project.

- You start with an initial Docker container based on ubuntu:22.04.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- No need to clone the project again.

The final objective is to successfully run the tests of the project.


### Java-Specific Instructions:
- Use Maven (`mvn test`) or Gradle (`gradle test`) to run tests
- Use `mvn install` or `gradle build` to build the project
- Check pom.xml (Maven) or build.gradle (Gradle) for dependencies
- Install system dependencies if needed
- Use `mvn dependency:resolve` to download dependencies


================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

    Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
        <command>bash command</command>
        e.g. install build-essential: <command>apt-get install -y build-essential</command>
        e.g. view file content: <command>cat README.md</command>
    Search: search the web for if you need some information, generate query and reply with following format:
        <search>the search query</search>
        e.g. <search>how to fix 'No module named setuptools'</search>
        e.g. <search>how to install python3 on ubuntu</search>
        e.g. <search>how to create development environment for python3</search>
    Stop: stop the setup loop once you think the setup is complete, reply with following format:
        <stop></stop>
    

Observation will be the result of running those actions.


Project Structure: the structure of the project, including files and directories.
Related Files: the content of related files of the project that may help you understand the project.
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: <command>your bash command here</command> or <search>your search query</search> or other actions available
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) ...
Thought: I think the setup should be fine
Action: <stop>stop the setup</stop>
Answer: the final result

= Vert.x Core Manual
:toc: left

At the heart of Vert.x is a set of Java APIs that we call *Vert.x Core*

https://github.com/eclipse/vert.x[Repository].

Vert.x core provides functionality for things like:

* Writing TCP clients and servers
* Writing HTTP clients and servers including support for WebSockets
* The Event bus
* Shared data - local maps and clustered distributed maps
* Periodic and delayed actions
* Deploying and undeploying Verticles
* Datagram Sockets
* DNS client
* File system access
* Virtual threads
* High availability
* Native transports
* Clustering

The functionality in core is fairly low level - you won't find stuff like database access, authorisation or high level
web functionality here - that kind of stuff you'll find in *Vert.x ext* (extensions).

Vert.x core is small and lightweight. You just use the parts you want. It's also entirely embeddable in your
existing applications - we don't force you to structure your applications in a special way just so you can use
Vert.x.

You can use core from any of the other languages that Vert.x supports. But here's a cool bit - we don't force
you to use the Java API directly from, say, JavaScript or Ruby - after all, different languages have different conventions
and idioms, and it would be odd to force Java idioms on Ruby developers (for example).
Instead, we automatically generate an *idiomatic* equivalent of the core Java APIs for each language.

From now on we'll just use the word *core* to refer to Vert.x core.

If you are using Maven or Gradle, add the following dependency to the _dependencies_ section of your
project descriptor to access the Vert.x Core API:

* Maven (in your `pom.xml`):

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
  <artifactId>vertx-core</artifactId>
  <version>${maven.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

* Gradle (in your `build.gradle` file):

[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
dependencies {
  compile 'io.vertx:vertx-core:${maven.version}'
}
----

Let's discuss the different concepts and features in core.

== In the beginning there was Vert.x

You can't do much in Vert.x-land unless you can communicate with a {@link io.vertx.core.Vertx} object!

It's the control centre of Vert.x and is how you do pretty much everything, including creating clients and servers,
getting a reference to the event bus, setting timers, as well as many other things.

So how do you get an instance?

If you're embedding Vert.x then you simply create an instance as follows:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.CoreExamples#example1}
----

NOTE: Most applications will only need a single Vert.x instance, but it's possible to create multiple Vert.x instances if you
require, for example, isolation between the event bus or different groups of servers and clients.

=== Specifying options when creating a Vertx object

When creating a Vert.x object you can also specify options if the defaults aren't right for you:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.CoreExamples#example2}
----

The {@link io.vertx.core.VertxOptions} object has many settings and allows you to configure things like clustering, high availability, pool sizes and various other settings.

=== Creating a clustered Vert.x object

If you're creating a *clustered Vert.x* (See the section on the <<event_bus, event bus>> for more information on clustering the event bus),
then you will normally use the asynchronous variant to create the Vertx object.

This is because it usually takes some time (maybe a few seconds) for the different Vert.x instances in a cluster to group together.
During that time, we don't want to block the calling thread, so we give the result to you asynchronously.

== Are you fluent?

You may have noticed that in the previous examples a *fluent* API was used.

A fluent API is where multiple methods calls can be chained together. For example:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.CoreExamples#example3}
----

This is a common pattern throughout Vert.x APIs, so get used to it.

Chaining calls like this allows you to write code that's a little bit less verbose. Of course, if you don't
like the fluent approach *we don't force you* to do it that way, you can happily ignore it if you prefer and write
your code like this:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.CoreExamples#example4}
----

== Don't call us, we'll call you.

The Vert.x APIs are largely _event driven_. This means that when things happen in Vert.x that you are interested in,
Vert.x will call you by sending you events.

Some example events are:

* a timer has fired
* some data has arrived on a socket,
* some data has been read from disk
* an exception has occurred
* an HTTP server has received a request

You handle events by providing _handlers_ to the Vert.x APIs. For example to receive a timer event every second you
would do:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.CoreExamples#example5}
----

Or to receive an HTTP request:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.CoreExamples#example6}
----

Some time later when Vert.x has an event to pass to your handler Vert.x will call it *asynchronously*.

This leads us to some important concepts in Vert.x:

== Don't block me!

With very few exceptions (i.e. some file system operations ending in 'Sync'), none of the APIs in Vert.x block the calling thread.

If a result can be provided immediately, it will be returned immediately, otherwise you will usually provide a handler
to receive events some time later.

Because none of the Vert.x APIs block threads that means you can use Vert.x to handle a lot of concurrency using
just a small number of threads.

With a conventional blocking API the calling thread might block when:

* Reading data from a socket
* Writing data to disk
* Sending a message to a recipient and waiting for a reply.
* ... Many other situations

In all the above cases, when your thread is waiting for a result it can't do anything else - it's effectively useless.

This means that if you want a lot of concurrency using blocking APIs then you need a lot of threads to prevent your
application grinding to a halt.

Threads have overhead in terms of the memory they require (e.g. for their stack) and in context switching.

For the levels of concurrency required in many modern applications, a blocking approach just doesn't scale.

== Reactor and Multi-Reactor

We mentioned before that Vert.x APIs are event driven - Vert.x passes events to handlers when they are available.

In most cases Vert.x calls your handlers using a thread called an *event loop*.

As nothing in Vert.x or your application blocks, the event loop can merrily run around delivering events to different handlers in succession
as they arrive.

Because nothing blocks, an event loop can potentially deliver huge amounts of events in a short amount of time.
For example a single event loop can handle many thousands of HTTP requests very quickly.

We call this the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern[Reactor Pattern].

You may have heard of this before - for example Node.js implements this pattern.

In a standard reactor implementation there is a *single event loop* thread which runs around in a loop delivering all
events to all handlers as they arrive.

The trouble with a single thread is it can only run on a single core at any one time, so if you want your single threaded
reactor application (e.g. your Node.js application) to scale over your multi-core server you have to start up and
manage many different processes.

Vert.x works differently here. Instead of a single event loop, each Vertx instance maintains *several event loops*.
By default we choose the number based on the number of available cores on the machine, but this can be overridden.

This means a single Vertx process can scale across your server, unlike Node.js.

We call this pattern the *Multi-Reactor Pattern* to distinguish it from the single threaded reactor pattern.

NOTE: Even though a Vertx instance maintains multiple event loops, any particular handler will never be executed
concurrently, and in most cases (with the exception of <<worker_verticles, worker verticles>>) will always be called
using the *exact same event loop*.

[[golden_rule]]
== The Golden Rule - Don't Block the Event Loop

We already know that the Vert.x APIs are non blocking and won't block the event loop, but that's not much help if
you block the event loop *yourself* in a handler.

If you do that, then that event loop will not be able to do anything else while it's blocked. If you block all of the
event loops in Vertx instance then your application will grind to a complete halt!

So don't do it! *You have been warned*.

Examples of blocking include:

* +Thread.sleep()+
* Waiting on a lock
* Waiting on a mutex or monitor (e.g. synchronized section)
* Doing a long lived database operation and waiting for a result
* Doing a complex calculation that takes some significant time.
* Spinning in a loop

If any of the above stop the event loop from doing anything else for a *significant amount of time* then you should
go immediately to the naughty step, and await further instructions.

So... what is a *significant amount of time*?

How long is a piece of string? It really depends on your application and the amount of concurrency you require.

If you have a single event loop, and you want to handle 10000 http requests per second, then it's clear that each request
can't take more than 0.1 ms to process, so you can't block for any more time than that.

*The maths is not hard and shall be left as an exercise for the reader.*

If your application is not responsive it might be a sign that you are blocking an event loop somewhere. To help
you diagnose such issues, Vert.x will automatically log warnings if it detects an event loop hasn't returned for
some time. If you see warnings like these in your logs, then you should investigate.

----
Thread vertx-eventloop-thread-3 has been blocked for 20458 ms
----

Vert.x will also provide stack traces to pinpoint exactly where the blocking is occurring.

If you want to turn off these warnings or change the settings, you can do that in the
{@link io.vertx.core.VertxOptions} object before creating the Vertx object.

== Verticles

Vert.x comes with a simple, scalable, _actor-like_ deployment and concurrency model out of the box that
you can use to save you writing your own.

*This model is entirely optional and Vert.x does not force you to create your applications in this way if you don't
want to.*.

The model does not claim to be a strict actor-model implementation, but it does share similarities especially
with respect to concurrency, scaling and deployment.

To use this model, you write your code as set of *verticles*.

Verticles are chunks of code that get deployed and run by Vert.x. A Vert.x instance maintains N event loop threads
(where N by default is core*2) by default. Verticles can be written in any of the languages that Vert.x supports
and a single application can include verticles written in multiple languages.

You can think of a verticle as a bit like an actor in the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model[Actor Model].

An application would typically be composed of many verticle instances running in the same Vert.x instance at the same
time. The different verticle instances communicate with each other by sending messages on the <<event_bus, event bus>>.

=== Writing Verticles

Verticle classes must implement the {@link io.vertx.core.Deployable} interface.

They can implement it directly if you like, but usually it's simpler to extend
the abstract class {@link io.vertx.core.VerticleBase}.

Here's an example verticle:

[source,java]
----
{@link examples.CoreExamples#simplestVerticle}
----

Normally you would override the start method like in the example above.

When Vert.x deploys the verticle it will call the start method, and when future returned by the method has completed the verticle will
be considered started.

You can also optionally override the stop method. This will be called by Vert.x when the verticle is un-deployed and when
the future returned by the method has completed the verticle will be considered stopped.

Here's a more elaborated example:

[source,java]
----
{@link examples.CoreExamples#httpServerVerticle}
----

You can even write a one-liner Verticle:

[source,java]
----
{@link examples.CoreExamples#oneLinerVerticle}
----

NOTE: You don't need to manually stop the HTTP server started by a verticle, in the verticle's stop method. Vert.x
will automatically stop any running server when the verticle is un-deployed.

=== What happened to Vert.x 4 Verticle and AbstractVerticle contracts?

The contract defined by `Verticle` and `AbstractVerticle` wasn't convenient anymore with Vert.x 5 future based model:

[source,java]
----
{@link examples.CoreExamples#verticleContract}
----

Nevertheless, `Verticle` and `AbstractVerticle` are not deprecated in Vert.x 5.
It is fine to use them, however it is not the default recommended choice anymore.

=== Verticle Types

There are two different types of verticles:

Standard Verticles:: These are the most common and useful type - they are always executed using an event loop thread.
We'll discuss this more in the next section.
Worker Verticles:: These run using a thread from the worker pool. An instance is never executed concurrently by more
than one thread.

=== Standard verticles

Standard verticles are assigned an event loop thread when they are created and the +start+ method is called with that
event loop. When you call any other methods that takes a handler on a core API from an event loop then Vert.x
will guarantee that those handlers, when called, will be executed on the same event loop.

This means we can guarantee that all the code in your verticle instance is always executed on the same event loop (as
long as you don't create your own threads and call it!).

This means you can write all the code in your application as single threaded and let Vert.x worry about the threading
and scaling. No more worrying about +synchronized+ and +volatile+ any more, and you also avoid many other cases of race conditions
and deadlock so prevalent when doing hand-rolled 'traditional' multi-threaded application development.

[[worker_verticles]]
=== Worker verticles

A worker verticle is just like a standard verticle but it's executed using a thread from the Vert.x worker thread pool,
rather than using an event loop.

Worker verticles are designed for calling blocking code, as they won't block any event loops.

If you don't want to use a worker verticle to run blocking code, you can also run <<blocking_code, inline blocking code>>
directly while on an event loop.

If you want to deploy a verticle as a worker verticle you do that with {@link io.vertx.core.DeploymentOptions#setThreadingModel}.

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.CoreExamples#example7_1}
----

Worker verticle instances are never executed concurrently by Vert.x by more than one thread, but can executed by
different threads at different times.

=== Virtual thread verticles

A virtual thread verticle is just like a standard verticle but it's executed using virtual threads, rather than using an event loop.

Virtual thread verticles are designed to use an async/await model with Vert.x futures.

If you want to deploy a verticle as a <<virtual_threads, virtual thread verticle>> you do that with {@link io.vertx.core.DeploymentOptions#setThreadingModel}.

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.CoreExamples#example7_2}
----

NOTE: this feature requires Java 21

=== Deploying verticles programmatically

You can deploy a verticle using one of the {@link io.vertx.core.Vertx#deployVerticle} method, specifying a verticle
name, or you can pass in a verticle instance you have already created yourself.

[source,java]
----
{@link examples.CoreExamples#example8}
----

You can also deploy verticles by specifying the verticle *name*.

The verticle name is used to look up the specific {@link io.vertx.core.spi.VerticleFactory} that will be used to
instantiate the actual verticle instance(s).

Here's an example of deploying some a Java Verticle using its class name:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.CoreExamples#example9}
----

=== Rules for mapping a verticle name to a verticle factory

When deploying verticle(s) using a name, the name is used to select the actual verticle factory that will instantiate
the verticle(s).

Verticle names can have a prefix - which is a string followed by a colon, which when present will be used to lookup the factory, e.g.

[source]
----
 groovy:com.mycompany.SomeGroovyCompiledVerticle // Use the Groovy verticle factory
----

When prefix is absent, Vert.x will look for a suffix and use that to lookup the factory, e.g.

[source]
----
 SomeScript.groovy // Will use the Groovy verticle factory
----

If no prefix or suffix is present, Vert.x will assume it's a Java fully qualified class name (FQCN) and try
and instantiate that.

=== How are Verticle Factories located?

Most Verticle factories are loaded from the classpath and registered at Vert.x startup.

You can also programmatically register and unregister verticle factories using {@link io.vertx.core.Vertx#registerVerticleFactory}
and {@link io.vertx.core.Vertx#unregisterVerticleFactory} if you wish.

=== Waiting for deployment to complete

Verticle deployment is asynchronous and may complete some time after the call to deploy has returned.

If you want to be notified when deployment is complete you can deploy specifying a completion handler:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.CoreExamples#example10}
----

The completion handler will be passed a result containing the deployment ID string, if deployment succeeded.

This deployment ID can be used later if you want to undeploy the deployment.

=== Un-deploying verticle deployments

Deployments can be un-deployed with {@link io.vertx.core.Vertx#undeploy}.

Un-deployment is itself asynchronous so if you want to be notified when un-deployment is complete you can deploy specifying a completion handler:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.CoreExamples#example11}
----

=== Specifying number of verticle instances

When deploying a verticle using
