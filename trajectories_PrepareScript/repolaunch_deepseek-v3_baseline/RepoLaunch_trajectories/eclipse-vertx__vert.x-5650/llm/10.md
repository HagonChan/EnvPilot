##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

### File:
------ START FILE BUILDING.md ------
# Building Vert.x

### Prerequisites

* Maven 3.2.x
* JDK 1.8+

### Regular build

    mvn clean install
    
### To run tests

    mvn test
        
To run a specific test

    mvn test -Dtest=<test_name/pattern>        
    
### Coverage build
    
To collect code coverage data, you need to launch the build with:
    
    mvn clean org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:prepare-agent package -Pcoverage
    
### Imports in IDE
    
To import the sources in your IDE, just import the project as a Maven project. However, check that:
      
*  `src/main/generated` is marked as a source directory
*  `target/generated-test-sources/test-annotations` is marked as a test source directory
    
This second directory is generated during the `test-compile` phase:
    
    mvn test-compile
    
### To build a distro

See the Vert.x stack project: https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-stack and more specifically the `stack-manager`.
