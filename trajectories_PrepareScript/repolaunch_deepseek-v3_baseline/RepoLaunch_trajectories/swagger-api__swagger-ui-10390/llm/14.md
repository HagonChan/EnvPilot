##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

### File:
------ START FILE .github/workflows/codeql.yml ------
# For most projects, this workflow file will not need changing; you simply need
# to commit it to your repository.
#
# You may wish to alter this file to override the set of languages analyzed,
# or to provide custom queries or build logic.
#
# ******** NOTE ********
# We have attempted to detect the languages in your repository. Please check
# the `language` matrix defined below to confirm you have the correct set of
# supported CodeQL languages.
