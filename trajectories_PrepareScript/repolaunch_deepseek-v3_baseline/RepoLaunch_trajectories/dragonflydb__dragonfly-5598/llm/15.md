##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

### File:

Thank you for your interest in Dragonfly DB. 

To keep things clean, we ask all commits to meet the following criteria:
  - Be Signed (git commit -s -m ...)
  - Valid Conventional Commit https://www.conventionalcommits.org/
  
  Special Commit Words are correlated to versioning. Specifically \"fix\" and \"feat\"
  - fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
  - feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
  - Breaking changes have a ! before the \":\"

  Finally, If there is an Issue for this Commit, Please add it to the end of the commit message.
  - Reference Issue Number at End of Commit Message (Optional)

Thank you for helping us label a \`fix\` and \`feat\` properly so that our commits, issues and semantic versioning are all aligned!

A Signed Conventional Commit with Issue Number look like: 

    git commit -s -m \"type(scope): description #112\"

Valid types:

    $(IFS=' '; echo "${types[*]}")

Example Document Change:

    docs(readme): Fix Example Links #121

Example Breaking New Feature
    feat(ingest)!: Add new ingest # 122

This is an example of a fix with an Issue #

    fix(ingest): Refactor for loop to list comprehension #123

Thank you for your contribution!

Sincerely,
The Dragonfly DB Contributors
