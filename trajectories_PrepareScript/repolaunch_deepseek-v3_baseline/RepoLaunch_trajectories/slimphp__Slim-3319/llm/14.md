##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to install dependencies and set up a environment that is able to run the tests of the project.

- You start with an initial Docker container based on ubuntu:22.04.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- No need to clone the project again.

The final objective is to successfully run the tests of the project.


### Generic Instructions:
- Examine the project structure to understand the build system
- Look for common files like:
  - Makefile, CMakeLists.txt (C/C++)
  - configure, autogen.sh (autotools)
  - setup.py, pyproject.toml, requirements.txt (Python)
  - package.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml (Node.js)
  - Cargo.toml (Rust)
  - pom.xml, build.gradle (Java)
  - go.mod (Go)
  - *.csproj, *.sln (C#)
- Install necessary build tools and dependencies
- Follow the project's README, INSTALL, or BUILD instructions if available
- Try common commands like 'make', 'cmake', './configure', etc.
- Install system dependencies through package manager (apt, yum, apk, etc.)


================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

    Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
        <command>bash command</command>
        e.g. install build-essential: <command>apt-get install -y build-essential</command>
        e.g. view file content: <command>cat README.md</command>
    Search: search the web for if you need some information, generate query and reply with following format:
        <search>the search query</search>
        e.g. <search>how to fix 'No module named setuptools'</search>
        e.g. <search>how to install python3 on ubuntu</search>
        e.g. <search>how to create development environment for python3</search>
    Stop: stop the setup loop once you think the setup is complete, reply with following format:
        <stop></stop>
    

Observation will be the result of running those actions.


Project Structure: the structure of the project, including files and directories.
Related Files: the content of related files of the project that may help you understand the project.
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: <command>your bash command here</command> or <search>your search query</search> or other actions available
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) ...
Thought: I think the setup should be fine
Action: <stop>stop the setup</stop>
Answer: the final result

# Slim Framework

[![Build Status](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/workflows/Tests/badge.svg?branch=4.x)](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/actions?query=branch:4.x)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/slimphp/Slim/badge.svg?branch=4.x)](https://coveralls.io/github/slimphp/Slim?branch=4.x)
[![Total Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/slim/slim/downloads)](https://packagist.org/packages/slim/slim)
[![License](https://poser.pugx.org/slim/slim/license)](https://packagist.org/packages/slim/slim)

Slim is a PHP micro-framework that helps you quickly write simple yet powerful web applications and APIs.

## Installation

It's recommended that you use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install Slim.

```bash
$ composer require slim/slim
```

This will install Slim and all required dependencies. Slim requires PHP 7.4 or newer.

## Choose a PSR-7 Implementation & ServerRequest Creator

Before you can get up and running with Slim you will need to choose a PSR-7 implementation that best fits your application. A few notable ones:
- [Slim-Psr7](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim-Psr7) - This is the Slim Framework PSR-7 implementation
- [httpsoft/http-message](https://github.com/httpsoft/http-message) & [httpsoft/http-server-request](https://github.com/httpsoft/http-server-request) - This is the fastest, strictest and most lightweight implementation available
- [Nyholm/psr7](https://github.com/Nyholm/psr7) & [Nyholm/psr7-server](https://github.com/Nyholm/psr7-server) - Performance is almost the same as the HttpSoft implementation
- [Guzzle/psr7](https://github.com/guzzle/psr7) - This is the implementation used by the Guzzle Client, featuring extra functionality for stream and file handling
- [laminas-diactoros](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-diactoros) - This is the Laminas (Zend) PSR-7 implementation


## Slim-Http Decorators

[Slim-Http](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim-Http) is a set of decorators for any PSR-7 implementation that we recommend is used with Slim Framework.
To install the Slim-Http library simply run the following command:

```bash
composer require slim/http
```

The `ServerRequest` and `Response` object decorators are automatically detected and applied by the internal factories. If you have installed Slim-Http and wish to turn off automatic object decoration then you can use the following statements:
```php
<?php

use Slim\Factory\AppFactory;
use Slim\Factory\ServerRequestCreatorFactory;

AppFactory::setSlimHttpDecoratorsAutomaticDetection(false);
ServerRequestCreatorFactory::setSlimHttpDecoratorsAutomaticDetection(false);

$app = AppFactory::create();

// ...
```

## Hello World using AppFactory with PSR-7 auto-detection
In order for auto-detection to work and enable you to use `AppFactory::create()` and `App::run()` without having to manually create a `ServerRequest` you need to install one of the following implementations:
- [Slim-Psr7](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim-Psr7) - Install using `composer require slim/psr7`
- [httpsoft/http-message](https://github.com/httpsoft/http-message) & [httpsoft/http-server-request](https://github.com/httpsoft/http-server-request) - Install using:
`composer require httpsoft/http-message httpsoft/http-server-request`
- [Nyholm/psr7](https://github.com/Nyholm/psr7) & [Nyholm/psr7-server](https://github.com/Nyholm/psr7-server) - Install using `composer require nyholm/psr7 nyholm/psr7-server`
- [Guzzle/psr7](https://github.com/guzzle/psr7) - Install using `composer require guzzlehttp/psr7`
- [laminas-diactoros](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-diactoros) - Install using `composer require laminas/laminas-diactoros`

Then create file _public/index.php_.

```php
<?php
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface as Response;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Request;
use Slim\Factory\AppFactory;

require __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

// Instantiate App
$app = AppFactory::create();

// Add error middleware
$app->addErrorMiddleware(true, true, true);

// Add routes
$app->get('/', function (Request $request, Response $response) {
    $response->getBody()->write('<a href="/hello/world">Try /hello/world</a>');
    return $response;
});

$app->get('/hello/{name}', function (Request $request, Response $response, $args) {
    $name = $args['name'];
    $response->getBody()->write("Hello, $name");
    return $response;
});

$app->run();
```

You may quickly test this using the built-in PHP server:
```bash
$ php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

Going to http://localhost:8000/hello/world will now display "Hello, world".

For more information on how to configure your web server, see the [Documentation](https://www.slimframework.com/docs/v4/start/web-servers.html).

## Tests
To execute the test suite, you'll need to install all development dependencies.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/slimphp/Slim
$ composer install
$ composer test
```

Thought: This is a PHP project using Slim Framework. I can see from the README and composer.json that it's a PHP project that uses Composer for dependency management. To run the tests, I need to install PHP and Composer first, then install the project dependencies. Let me start by checking what's available in the system and installing PHP and Composer.

Configuring tzdata
------------------

Please select the geographic area in which you live. Subsequent configuration
questions will narrow this down by presenting a list of cities, representing
the time zones in which they are located.

  1. Africa      4. Australia  7. Atlantic  10. Pacific  13. Legacy
  2. America     5. Arctic     8. Europe    11. US
  3. Antarctica  6. Asia       9. Indian    12. Etc
Geographic area: 
**Exited due to timeout**

None@None:None $

exit code: 124

================================== Ai Message ==================================

Thought: The installation was interrupted by a timeout during tzdata configuration. I need to install PHP and Composer without the interactive timezone configuration. Let me try a different approach by setting the timezone non-interactively first, then installing the packages.

Action: <command>DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y tzdata</command>
================================ Human Message =================================

Observation:
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y tzdata

Geographic area: 
**Exited due to timeout**

None@None:None $

exit code: 124

##### LLM OUTPUT #####
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Thought: The tzdata installation is still timing out. Let me try to pre-configure the timezone to avoid the interactive prompt, then install the PHP packages.

Action: <command>echo "tzdata tzdata/Areas select Etc" | debconf-set-selections && echo "tzdata tzdata/Zones/Etc select UTC" | debconf-set-selections && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y tzdata</command>
