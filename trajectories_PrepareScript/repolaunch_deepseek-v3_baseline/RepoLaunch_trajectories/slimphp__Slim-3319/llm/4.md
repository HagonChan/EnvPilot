##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

# How to Contribute

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the Slim Framework repository
2. Create a new branch for each feature or improvement
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the **4.x** branch

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a
pull request for each branch. This allows me to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.

## Style Guide

All pull requests must adhere to the [PSR-12 standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-12-extended-coding-style-guide.md).

## Unit Testing

All pull requests must be accompanied by passing unit tests and complete code coverage. The Slim Framework uses phpunit for testing.
