# Release checklist

* Run `build-scripts/create-release.py -R libsdl-org/SDL --ref <branch>` to do
  a dry run creating the release assets. Verify that the archives are correct.

* Tag the release, e.g. `git tag release-3.8.0; git push --tags`

* Run `build-scripts/create-release.py -R libsdl-org/SDL --ref <release-tag>`
  to have GitHub Actions create release assets. This makes sure the revision
  string baked into the archives is correct.

* Verify that the source archive REVISION.txt has the correct release tag.

* Sign the source archives and upload everything to libsdl.org

* Create a GitHub release and attach the archives you just generated.
