##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to install dependencies and set up a environment that is able to run the tests of the project.

- You start with an initial Docker container based on ubuntu:22.04.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- No need to clone the project again.

The final objective is to successfully run the tests of the project.


### C-Specific Instructions:
- Install build-essential if not available: `apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential`
- Use `make` to build the project (check for Makefile)
- Use `gcc` or `clang` directly if no Makefile exists
- Check for CMakeLists.txt and use `cmake` if available
- Install dependencies through package manager (apt, yum, etc.)
- Look for configure scripts and run `./configure && make`


================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

    Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
        <command>bash command</command>
        e.g. install build-essential: <command>apt-get install -y build-essential</command>
        e.g. view file content: <command>cat README.md</command>
    Search: search the web for if you need some information, generate query and reply with following format:
        <search>the search query</search>
        e.g. <search>how to fix 'No module named setuptools'</search>
        e.g. <search>how to install python3 on ubuntu</search>
        e.g. <search>how to create development environment for python3</search>
    Stop: stop the setup loop once you think the setup is complete, reply with following format:
        <stop></stop>
    

Observation will be the result of running those actions.


Project Structure: the structure of the project, including files and directories.
Related Files: the content of related files of the project that may help you understand the project.
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: <command>your bash command here</command> or <search>your search query</search> or other actions available
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) ...
Thought: I think the setup should be fine
Action: <stop>stop the setup</stop>

# Introduction to SDL with Android Studio

We'll start by creating a simple project to build and run [hello.c](hello.c)

- Use our handy script to create a template project:
```sh
./build-scripts/create-android-project.py org.libsdl.hello docs/hello.c
```
- Run Android Studio and open the newly created build/org.libsdl.hello directory
- Build and run!

Additional information and troubleshooting is available in [README-android.md](README-android.md)

```
File: docs/README-linux.md
```
Linux
================================================================================

By default SDL will only link against glibc, the rest of the features will be
enabled dynamically at runtime depending on the available features on the target
system. So, for example if you built SDL with XRandR support and the target
system does not have the XRandR libraries installed, it will be disabled
at runtime, and you won't get a missing library error, at least with the
default configuration parameters.


Build Dependencies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ubuntu 18.04, all available features enabled:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential git make \
    pkg-config cmake ninja-build gnome-desktop-testing libasound2-dev libpulse-dev \
    libaudio-dev libjack-dev libsndio-dev libx11-dev libxext-dev \
    libxrandr-dev libxcursor-dev libxfixes-dev libxi-dev libxss-dev \
    libxkbcommon-dev libdrm-dev libgbm-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libgles2-mesa-dev \
    libegl1-mesa-dev libdbus-1-dev libibus-1.0-dev libudev-dev fcitx-libs-dev

Ubuntu 22.04+ can also add `libpipewire-0.3-dev libwayland-dev libdecor-0-dev liburing-dev` to that command line.

Fedora 35, all available features enabled:

    sudo yum install gcc git-core make cmake \
    alsa-lib-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel nas-devel pipewire-devel \
    libX11-devel libXext-devel libXrandr-devel libXcursor-devel libXfixes-devel \
    libXi-devel libXScrnSaver-devel dbus-devel ibus-devel fcitx-devel \
    systemd-devel mesa-libGL-devel libxkbcommon-devel mesa-libGLES-devel \
    mesa-libEGL-devel vulkan-devel wayland-devel wayland-protocols-devel \
    libdrm-devel mesa-libgbm-devel libusb-devel libdecor-devel \
    pipewire-jack-audio-connection-kit-devel \

Fedora 39+ can also add `liburing-devel` to that command line.

NOTES:
- The sndio audio target is unavailable on Fedora (but probably not what you
  should want to use anyhow).

openSUSE Tumbleweed:

    sudo zypper in libunwind-devel libusb-1_0-devel Mesa-libGL-devel libxkbcommon-devel libdrm-devel \
    libgbm-devel pipewire-devel libpulse-devel sndio-devel Mesa-libEGL-devel

Joystick does not work
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you compiled or are using a version of SDL with udev support (and you should!)
there's a few issues that may cause SDL to fail to detect your joystick. To
debug this, start by installing the evtest utility. On Ubuntu/Debian:

    sudo apt-get install evtest

Then run:

    sudo evtest

You'll hopefully see your joystick listed along with a name like "/dev/input/eventXX"
Now run:

    cat /dev/input/event/XX

If you get a permission error, you need to set a udev rule to change the mode of
your device (see below)

Also, try:

    sudo udevadm info --query=all --name=input/eventXX

If you see a line stating ID_INPUT_JOYSTICK=1, great, if you don't see it,
you need to set up an udev rule to force this variable.

A combined rule for the Saitek Pro Flight Rudder Pedals to fix both issues looks
like:

    SUBSYSTEM=="input", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0763", ATTRS{idVendor}=="06a3", MODE="0666", ENV{ID_INPUT_JOYSTICK}="1"
    SUBSYSTEM=="input", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0764", ATTRS{idVendor}=="06a3", MODE="0666", ENV{ID_INPUT_JOYSTICK}="1"

You can set up similar rules for your device by changing the values listed in
idProduct and idVendor. To obtain these values, try:

    sudo udevadm info -a --name=input/eventXX | grep idVendor
    sudo udevadm info -a --name=input/eventXX | grep idProduct

If multiple values come up for each of these, the one you want is the first one of each.

On other systems which ship with an older udev (such as CentOS), you may need
to set up a rule such as:

    SUBSYSTEM=="input", ENV{ID_CLASS}=="joystick", ENV{ID_INPUT_JOYSTICK}="1"

## Filing a GitHub issue

### Reporting a bug

If you think you have found a bug and would like to report it, here are the steps you should take:

-   Before opening a new issue, ensure your bug has not already been reported on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues).
-   On the issue tracker, click on [New Issue](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/new).
-   Include details about your environment, such as your Operating System and SDL version.
-   If possible, provide a small example that reproduces your bug.

### Suggesting enhancements

If you want to suggest changes for the project, here are the steps you should take:

-   Check if the suggestion has already been made on:
    -   the [issue tracker](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues);
    -   the [discourse forum](https://discourse.libsdl.org/);
    -   or if a [pull request](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pulls) already exists.
-   On the issue tracker, click on [New Issue](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/new).
-   Describe what change you would like to happen.

## Contributing code

This section will cover how the process of forking the project, making a change and opening a pull request.

### Forking the project

The first step consists in making a fork of the project, this is only necessary for the first contribution.

Head over to https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL and click on the `Fork` button in the top right corner of your screen, you may leave the fields unchanged and click `Create Fork`.

You will be redirected to your fork of the repository, click the green `Code` button and copy the git clone link.

If you had already forked the repository, you may update it from the web page using the `Fetch upstream` button.

### Following the style guide

Code formatting is done using a custom `.clang-format` file, you can learn more about how to run it [here](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html).

Some legacy code may not be formatted, so please avoid formatting the whole file at once and only format around your changes.

For your commit message to be properly displayed on GitHub, it should contain:

-   A short description of the commit of 50 characters or less on the first line.
-   If necessary, add a blank line followed by a long description, each line should be 72 characters or less.

For example:

```
Fix crash in SDL_FooBar.

This addresses the issue #123456 by making sure Foo was successful
before calling Bar.
```

### Running the tests

Tests allow you to verify if your changes did not break any behaviour, here are the steps to follow:

-   Before pushing, run the `testautomation` suite on your machine, there should be no more failing tests after your change than before.
-   After pushing to your fork, Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions) will ensure compilation and tests still pass on other systems.

### Opening a pull request

-   Head over to your fork's GitHub page.
-   Click on the `Contribute` button and `Open Pull Request`.
-   Fill out the pull request template.
-   If any changes are requested, you can add new commits to your fork and they will be automatically added to the pull request.

### Continuous integration

For each push and/or pull request, GitHub Actions will try to build SDL and the test suite on most supported platforms.

Its behaviour can be influenced slightly by including SDL-specific tags in your commit message:
- `[sdl-ci-filter GLOB]` limits the platforms for which to run ci.
- `[sdl-ci-artifacts]` forces SDL artifacts, which can then be downloaded from the summary page.
- `[sdl-ci-trackmem-symbol-names]` makes sure the final report generated by `--trackmem` contains symbol names.

## Contributing to the documentation

### Editing a function documentation

The wiki documentation for API functions is synchronised from the headers' doxygen comments. As such, all modifications to syntax; function parameters; return value; version; related functions should be done in the header directly.

### Editing the wiki

Other changes to the wiki should done directly from https://wiki.libsdl.org/  ... Just click the "edit" link at the bottom of any page!

GDK
=====

This port allows SDL applications to run via Microsoft's Game Development Kit (GDK).

Windows (GDK) and  Xbox One/Xbox Series (GDKX) are both supported and all the required code is included in this public SDL release. However, only licensed Xbox developers have access to the GDKX libraries which will allow you to build the Xbox targets.


Requirements
------------

* Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 (in theory, it should also work in 2017 or 2019, but this has not been tested)
* Microsoft GDK October 2023 Update 1 or newer (public release [here](https://github.com/microsoft/GDK/releases/tag/October_2023_Update_1))
* For Xbox, you will need the corresponding GDKX version (licensed developers only)
* To publish a package or successfully authenticate a user, you will need to create an app id/configure services in Partner Center. However, for local testing purposes (without authenticating on Xbox Live), the test identifiers used by the GDK test programs in the included solution work.


Windows GDK Status
------

The Windows GDK port supports the full set of Win32 APIs, renderers, controllers, input devices, etc., as the normal Windows x64 build of SDL.

* Additionally, the GDK port adds the following:
  * Compile-time platform detection for SDL programs. The `SDL_PLATFORM_GDK` is `#define`d on every GDK platform, and the  `SDL_PLATFORM_WINGDK` is `#define`d on Windows GDK, specifically. (This distinction exists because other GDK platforms support a smaller subset of functionality. This allows you to mark code for "any" GDK separate from Windows GDK.)
  * GDK-specific setup:
    * Initializing/uninitializing the game runtime, and initializing Xbox Live services
    * Creating a global task queue and setting it as the default for the process. When running any async operations, passing in `NULL` as the task queue will make the task get added to the global task queue.

  * An implementation on `WinMain` that performs the above GDK setup that you can use by #include'ing SDL_main.h in the source file that includes your standard main() function. If you are unable to do this, you can instead manually call `SDL_RunApp` from your entry point, passing in your `SDL_main` function and `NULL` as the parameters. To use `SDL_RunApp`, `#define SDL_MAIN_HANDLED` before `#include <SDL3/SDL_main.h>`.
  * Global task queue callbacks are dispatched during `SDL_PumpEvents` (which is also called internally if using `SDL_PollEvent`).
  * You can get the handle of the global task queue through `SDL_GetGDKTaskQueue`, if needed. When done with the queue, be sure to use `XTaskQueueCloseHandle` to decrement the reference count (otherwise it will cause a resource leak).

* Single-player games have some additional features available:
  * Call `SDL_GetGDKDefaultUser` to get the default XUserHandle pointer.
  * `SDL_GetPrefPath` still works, but only for single-player titles.

  These functions mostly wrap around async APIs, and thus should be treated as synchronous alternatives. Also note that the single-player functions return on any OS errors, so be sure to validate the return values!

* What doesn't work:
  * Compilation with anything other than through the included Visual C++ solution file

## VisualC-GDK Solution

The included `VisualC-GDK/SDL.sln` solution includes the following targets for the Gaming.Desktop.x64 configuration:

* SDL3 (DLL) - This is the typical SDL3.dll, but for Gaming.Desktop.x64.
* tests/testgamecontroller - Standard SDL test program demonstrating controller functionality.
* tests/testgdk - GDK-specific test program that demonstrates using the global task queue to login a user into Xbox Live.
  *NOTE*: As of the June 2022 GDK, you cannot test user logins without a valid Title ID and MSAAppId. You will need to manually change the identifiers in the `MicrosoftGame.config` to your valid IDs from Partner Center if you wish to test this.
* tests/testsprite - Standard SDL test program demonstrating sprite drawing functionality.

If you set one of the test programs as a startup project, you can run it directly from Visual Studio.

Windows GDK Setup, Detailed Steps
---------------------

These steps assume you already have a game using SDL that runs on Windows x64 along with a corresponding Visual Studio solution file for the x64 version. If you don't have this, it's easiest to use one of the test program vcxproj files in the `VisualC-GDK` directory as a starting point, though you will still need to do most of the steps below.

### 1. Add a Gaming.Desktop.x64 Configuration ###

In your game's existing Visual Studio Solution, go to Build > Configuration Manager. From the "Active solution platform" drop-down select "New...". From the drop-down list, select Gaming.Desktop.x64 and copy the settings from the x64 configuration.

### 2. Build SDL3 for GDK ###

Open `VisualC-GDK/SDL.sln` in Visual Studio, you need to build the SDL3 target for the Gaming.Desktop.x64 platform (Release is recommended). You will need to copy/keep track of the `SDL3.dll`, `XCurl.dll` (which is output by Gaming.Desktop.x64), and `SDL3.lib` output files for your game project.

*Alternatively*, you could setup your solution file to instead reference the SDL3 project file targets from the SDL source, and add those projects as a dependency. This would mean that SDL3 would be built when your game is built.

### 3. Configuring Project Settings ###

While the Gaming.Desktop.x64 configuration sets most of the required settings, there are some additional items to configure for your game project under the Gaming.Desktop.x64 Configuration:

*  Under C/C++ > General > Additional Include Directories, make sure the `SDL/include` path is referenced
* Under Linker > General > Additional Library Directories, make sure to reference the path where the newly-built SDL3.lib are
* Under Linker > Input > Additional Dependencies, you need the following:
  * `SDL3.lib`
  * `xgameruntime.lib`
  * `../Microsoft.Xbox.Services.GDK.C.Thunks.lib`
* Note that in general, the GDK libraries depend on the MSVC C/C++ runtime, so there is no way to remove this dependency from a GDK program that links against GDK.

### 4. Setting up SDL_main ###

Rather than using your own implementation of `WinMain`, it's recommended that you instead `#include <SDL3/SDL_main.h>` and declare a standard main function. If you are unable to do this, you can instead manually call `SDL_RunApp` from your entry point, passing in your `SDL_main` function and `NULL` as the parameters; in that case `#define SDL_MAIN_HANDLED` before including SDL_main.h

### 5. Required DLLs ###

The game will not launch in the debugger unless required DLLs are included in the directory that contains the game's .exe file. You need to make sure that the following files are copied into the directory:

* Your SDL3.dll
* "$(Console_GRDKExtLibRoot)Xbox.Services.API.C\DesignTime\CommonConfiguration\Neutral\Lib\Release\Microsoft.Xbox.Services.GDK.C.Thunks.dll"
* XCurl.dll

You can either copy these in a post-build step, or you can add the dlls into the project and set its Configuration Properties > General > Item type to "Copy file," which will also copy them into the output directory.

### 6. Setting up MicrosoftGame.config ###

You can copy `VisualC-GDK/tests/testgdk/MicrosoftGame.config` and use that as a starting point in your project. Minimally, you will want to change the Executable Name attribute, the DefaultDisplayName, and the Description.

This file must be copied into the same directory as the game's .exe file. As with the DLLs, you can either use a post-build step or the "Copy file" item type.

For basic testing, you do not need to change anything else in `MicrosoftGame.config`. However, if you want to test any Xbox Live services (such as logging in users) _or_ publish a package, you will need to setup a Game app on Partner Center.

Then, you need to set the following values to the values from Partner Center:

* Identity tag - Name and Publisher attributes
* TitleId
* MSAAppId

### 7. Adding Required Logos

Several logo PNG files are required to be able to launch the game, even from the debugger. You can use the sample logos provided in `VisualC-GDK/logos`. As with the other files, they must be copied into the same directory as the game's .exe file.


### 8. Copying any Data Files ###

When debugging GDK games, there is no way to specify a working directory. Therefore, any required game data must also be copied into the output directory, likely in a post-build step.


### 9. Build and Run from Visual Studio ###

At this point, you should be able to build and run your game from the Visual Studio Debugger. If you get any linker errors, make sure you double-check that you referenced all the required libs.

If you are testing Xbox Live functionality, it's likely you will need to change to the Sandbox for your title. To do this:

1. Run "Desktop VS 2022 Gaming Command Prompt" from the Start Menu
2. Switch the sandbox name with:
   `XblPCSandbox SANDBOX.#`
3. (To switch back to the retail sandbox):
   `XblPCSandbox RETAIL`

### 10. Packaging and Installing Locally

You can use one of the test program's `PackageLayout.xml` as a starting point. Minimally, you will need to change the exe to the correct name and also reference any required game data. As with the other data files, it's easiest if you have this copy to the output directory, although it's not a requirement as you can specify relative paths to files.

To create the package:

1. Run "Desktop VS 2022 Gaming Command Prompt" from the Start Menu
2. `cd` to the directory containing the `PackageLayout.xml` with the correct paths (if you use the local path as in the sample package layout, this would be from your .exe output directory)
3. `mkdir Package` to create an output directory
4. To package the file into the `Package` directory, use:
    `makepkg pack /f PackageLayout.xml /lt /d . /nogameos /pc /pd Package`
5. To install the package, use:
   `wdapp install PACKAGENAME.msixvc`
6. Once the package is installed, you can run it from the start menu.
7. As with when running from Visual Studio, if you need to test any Xbox Live functionality you must switch to the correct sandbox.

Xbox GDKX Setup
---------------------
In general, the same process in the Windows GDK instructions work. There are just a few additional notes:
* For Xbox One consoles, use the Gaming.Xbox.XboxOne.x64 target
* For Xbox Series consoles, use the Gaming.Xbox.Scarlett.x64 target
* The Xbox One target sets the `SDL_PLATFORM_XBOXONE` define and the Xbox Series target sets the `SDL_PLATFORM_XBOXSERIES` define
* You don't need to link against the Xbox.Services Thunks lib nor include that dll in your package (it doesn't exist for Xbox)
* The shader blobs for Xbox are created in a pre-build step for the Xbox targets, rather than included in the source (due to NDA and version compatibility reasons)
* To create a package, use:
  `makepkg pack /f PackageLayout.xml /lt /d . /pd Package`
* To install the package, use:
  `xbapp install [PACKAGE].xvc`
* For some reason, if you make changes that require SDL3.dll to build, and you are running through the debugger (instead of a package), you have to rebuild your .exe target for the debugger to recognize the dll has changed and needs to be transferred to the console again
* While there are successful releases of Xbox titles using this port, it is not as extensively tested as other targets

Troubleshooting
---------------

#### Xbox Live Login does not work

As of June 2022 GDK, you must have a valid Title Id and MSAAppId in order to test Xbox Live functionality such as user login. Make sure these are set correctly in the `MicrosoftGame.config`. This means that even testgdk will not let you login without setting these properties to valid values.

Furthermore, confirm that your PC is set to the correct sandbox.


#### "The current user has already installed an unpackaged version of this app. A packaged version cannot replace this." error when installing

Prior to June 2022 GDK, running from the Visual Studio debugger would still locally register the app (and it would appear on the start menu). To fix this, you have to uninstall it (it's simplest to right click on it from the start menu to uninstall it).

# Introduction to SDL with Emscripten

First, you should have the Emscripten SDK installed from:

https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html

We'll start by creating a simple project to build and run [hello.c](hello.c)

## Building SDL

Once you have a command line interface with the Emscripten SDK set up and you've changed directory to the SDL directory, you can build SDL like this:

```sh
mkdir hello
cd hello
emcmake cmake ..
emmake make
```

## Building your app

In this case we'll just run a simple command to compile our source with the SDL library we just built:
```sh
emcc -o index.html ../docs/hello.c -I../include -L. -lSDL3
```

## Running your app

You can now run your app by pointing a webserver at your build directory and connecting a web browser to it.

## More information

A more complete example is available at:

https://github.com/Ravbug/sdl3-sample

Additional information and troubleshooting is available in [README-emscripten.md](README-emscripten.md)

```
File: docs/README-emscripten.md
```
# Emscripten

## The state of things

(As of October 2024, but things move quickly and we don't update this
document often.)

In modern times, all the browsers you probably care about (Chrome, Firefox,
Edge, and Safari, on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS and Android), support some
reasonable base configurations:

- WebAssembly (don't bother with asm.js any more)
- WebGL (which will look like OpenGL ES 2 or 3 to your app).
- Threads (see caveats, though!)
- Game controllers
- Autoupdating (so you can assume they have a recent version of the browser)

All this to say we're at the point where you don't have to make a lot of
concessions to get even a fairly complex SDL-based game up and running.


## RTFM

This document is a quick rundown of some high-level details. The
documentation at [emscripten.org](https://emscripten.org/) is vast
and extremely detailed for a wide variety of topics, and you should at
least skim through it at some point.


## Porting your app to Emscripten

Many many things just need some simple adjustments and they'll compile
like any other C/C++ code, as long as SDL was handling the platform-specific
work for your program.

First: assembly language code has to go. Replace it with C. You can even use
[x86 SIMD intrinsic functions in Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/simd.html)!

Second: Middleware has to go. If you have a third-party library you link
against, you either need an Emscripten port of it, or the source code to it
to compile yourself, or you need to remove it.

Third: If your program starts in a function called main(), you need to get
out of it and into a function that gets called repeatedly, and returns quickly,
called a mainloop.

Somewhere in your program, you probably have something that looks like a more
complicated version of this:

```c
void main(void)
{
    initialize_the_game();
    while (game_is_still_running) {
        check_for_new_input();
        think_about_stuff();
        draw_the_next_frame();
    }
    deinitialize_the_game();
}
```

This will not work on Emscripten, because the main thread needs to be free
to do stuff and can't sit in this loop forever. So Emscripten lets you set up
a [mainloop](https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/emscripten-runtime-environment.html#browser-main-loop).

```c
static void mainloop(void)   /* this will run often, possibly at the monitor's refresh rate */
{
    if (!game_is_still_running) {
        deinitialize_the_game();
        #ifdef __EMSCRIPTEN__
        emscripten_cancel_main_loop();  /* this should "kill" the app. */
        #else
        exit(0);
        #endif
    }

    check_for_new_input();

void main(void)
{
    initialize_the_game();
    #ifdef __EMSCRIPTEN__
    emscripten_set_main_loop(mainloop, 0, 1);
    #else
    while (1) { mainloop(); }
    #endif
}
```

Basically, `emscripten_set_main_loop(mainloop, 0, 1);` says "run
`mainloop` over and over until I end the program." The function will
run, and return, freeing the main thread for other tasks, and then
run again when it's time. The `1` parameter does some magic to make
your main() function end immediately; this is useful because you
don't want any shutdown code that might be sitting below this code
to actually run if main() were to continue on, since we're just
getting started.

Another option is to use SDL' main callbacks, which handle this for you
without platform-specific code in your app. Please refer to
[the wiki](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/README/main-functions#main-callbacks-in-sdl3)
or `docs/README-main-functions.md` in the SDL source code.



There's a lot of little details that are beyond the scope of this
document, but that's the biggest initial set of hurdles to porting
your app to the web.


## Do you need threads?

If you plan to use threads, they work on all major browsers now. HOWEVER,
they bring with them a lot of careful considerations. Rendering _must_
be done on the main thread. This is a general guideline for many
platforms, but a hard requirement on the web.

Many other things also must happen on the main thread; often times SDL
and Emscripten make efforts to "proxy" work to the main thread that
must be there, but you have to be careful (and read more detailed
documentation than this for the finer points).

Even when using threads, your main thread needs to set an Emscripten
mainloop (or use SDL's main callbacks) that runs quickly and returns, or
things will fail to work correctly.

You should definitely read [Emscripten's pthreads docs](https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/pthreads.html)
for all the finer points. Mostly SDL's thread API will work as expected,
but is built on pthreads, so it shares the same little incompatibilities
that are documented there, such as where you can use a mutex, and when
a thread will start running, etc.


IMPORTANT: You have to decide to either build something that uses
threads or something that doesn't; you can't have one build
that works everywhere. This is an Emscripten (or maybe WebAssembly?
Or just web browsers in general?) limitation. If you aren't using
threads, it's easier to not enable them at all, at build time.

If you use threads, you _have to_ run from a web server that has
[COOP/COEP headers set correctly](https://web.dev/why-coop-coep/)
or your program will fail to start at all.

If building with threads, `__EMSCRIPTEN_PTHREADS__` will be defined
for checking with the C preprocessor, so you can build something
different depending on what sort of build you're compiling.


## Audio

Audio works as expected at the API level, but not exactly like other
platforms.

You'll only see a single default audio device. Audio recording also works;
if the browser pops up a prompt to ask for permission to access the
microphone, the SDL_OpenAudioDevice call will succeed and start producing
silence at a regular interval. Once the user approves the request, real
audio data will flow. If the user denies it, the app is not informed and
will just continue to receive silence.

Modern web browsers will not permit web pages to produce sound before the
user has interacted with them (clicked or tapped on them, usually); this is
for several reasons, not the least of which being that no one likes when a
random browser tab suddenly starts making noise and the user has to scramble
to figure out which and silence it.

SDL will allow you to open the audio device for playback in this
circumstance, and your audio callback will fire, but SDL will throw the audio
data away until the user interacts with the page. This helps apps that depend
on the audio callback to make progress, and also keeps audio playback in sync
once the app is finally allowed to make noise.

There are two reasonable ways to deal with the silence at the app level:
if you are writing some sort of media player thing, where the user expects
there to be a volume control when you mouseover the canvas, just default
that control to a muted state; if the user clicks on the control to unmute
it, on this first click, open the audio device. This allows the media to
play at start, and the user c

Thought: Based on the project structure and related files, this appears to be the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) project. To run the tests, I need to build SDL first. Looking at the docs/README-linux.md file, it provides the build dependencies for Ubuntu 22.04.
