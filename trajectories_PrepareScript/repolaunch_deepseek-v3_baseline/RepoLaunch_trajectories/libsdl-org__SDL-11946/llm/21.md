Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

# Introduction to SDL with Emscripten

First, you should have the Emscripten SDK installed from:

https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html

We'll start by creating a simple project to build and run [hello.c](hello.c)

## Building SDL

Once you have a command line interface with the Emscripten SDK set up and you've changed directory to the SDL directory, you can build SDL like this:

```sh
mkdir hello
cd hello
emcmake cmake ..
emmake make
```

## Building your app

In this case we'll just run a simple command to compile our source with the SDL library we just built:
```sh
emcc -o index.html ../docs/hello.c -I../include -L. -lSDL3
```

## Running your app

You can now run your app by pointing a webserver at your build directory and connecting a web browser to it.

## More information

A more complete example is available at:

Additional information and troubleshooting is available in [README-emscripten.md](README-emscripten.md)
