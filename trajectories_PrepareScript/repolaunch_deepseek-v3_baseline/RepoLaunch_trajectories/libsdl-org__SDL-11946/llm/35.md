================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

# To build and use SDL:

SDL supports a number of development environments:
- [CMake](docs/INTRO-cmake.md)
- [Visual Studio on Windows](docs/INTRO-visualstudio.md)
- [Xcode on Apple platforms](docs/INTRO-xcode.md)
- [Android Studio](docs/INTRO-androidstudio.md)
- [Emscripten for web](docs/INTRO-emscripten.md)

SDL is also usable in other environments. The basic steps are to use CMake to build the library and then use the headers and library that you built in your project. You can search online to see if anyone has specific steps for your setup.

# Documentation
