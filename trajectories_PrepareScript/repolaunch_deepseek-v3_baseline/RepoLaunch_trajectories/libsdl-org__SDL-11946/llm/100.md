##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

# Introduction to SDL with CMake

The easiest way to use SDL is to include it as a subproject in your project.

We'll start by creating a simple project to build and run [hello.c](hello.c)

Create the file CMakeLists.txt
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
project(hello)

# set the output directory for built objects.
# This makes sure that the dynamic library goes into the build directory automatically.
set(CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/$<CONFIGURATION>")
set(CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/$<CONFIGURATION>")

# This assumes the SDL source is available in vendored/SDL
add_subdirectory(vendored/SDL EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

# Create your game executable target as usual
add_executable(hello WIN32 hello.c)

# Link to the actual SDL3 library.
target_link_libraries(hello PRIVATE SDL3::SDL3)
```

Build:
```sh
cmake .
cmake --build .
```

Run:
- On Windows the executable is in the Debug directory:
```sh
./Debug/hello
``` 
- On other platforms the executable is in the current directory:
```sh
./hello
```
