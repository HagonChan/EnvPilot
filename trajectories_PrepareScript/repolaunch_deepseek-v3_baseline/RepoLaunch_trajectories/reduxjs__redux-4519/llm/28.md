##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to install dependencies and set up a environment that is able to run the tests of the project.

- You start with an initial Docker container based on ubuntu:22.04.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- No need to clone the project again.

The final objective is to successfully run the tests of the project.


### TypeScript-Specific Instructions:
- Use npm, yarn, or pnpm to install dependencies (check package.json and lockfiles)
- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies
- Check package.json for test scripts and build commands
- Consider using `npm ci` for faster, reproducible builds if package-lock.json exists
- Install TypeScript globally if needed (e.g., `npm install -g typescript`)


================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

    Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
        <command>bash command</command>
        e.g. install build-essential: <command>apt-get install -y build-essential</command>
        e.g. view file content: <command>cat README.md</command>
    Search: search the web for if you need some information, generate query and reply with following format:
        <search>the search query</search>
        e.g. <search>how to fix 'No module named setuptools'</search>
        e.g. <search>how to install python3 on ubuntu</search>
        e.g. <search>how to create development environment for python3</search>
    Stop: stop the setup loop once you think the setup is complete, reply with following format:
        <stop></stop>
    

Observation will be the result of running those actions.


Project Structure: the structure of the project, including files and directories.
Related Files: the content of related files of the project that may help you understand the project.
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: <command>your bash command here</command> or <search>your search query</search> or other actions available
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) ...
Thought: I think the setup should be fine
Action: <stop>stop the setup</stop>
Answer: the final result

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
(Not to be confused with a WordPress framework – [Redux Framework](https://redux.io))

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).

You can use Redux together with [React](https://reactjs.org), or with any other view library.
It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), and has a rich ecosystem of addons.

## Before Proceeding Further

Redux is a valuable tool for organizing your state, but you should also consider whether it's appropriate for your situation. Please don't use Redux just because someone said you should - instead, please take some time to understand the potential benefits and tradeoffs of using it.

Here are some suggestions on when it makes sense to use Redux:

- You have reasonable amounts of data changing over time
- You need a single source of truth for your state
- You find that keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient

Yes, these guidelines are subjective and vague, but this is for a good reason. The point at which you should integrate Redux into your application is different for every user and different for every application.

## Developer Experience

Dan Abramov (author of Redux) wrote Redux while working on his React Europe talk called [“Hot Reloading with Time Travel”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs). His goal was to create a state management library with a minimal API but completely predictable behavior. Redux makes it possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.

## Influences

Redux evolves the ideas of [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/), but avoids its complexity by taking cues from [Elm](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/).
Even if you haven't used Flux or Elm, Redux only takes a few minutes to get started with.

## Basic Example

The whole global state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single _store_.
The only way to change the state tree is to create an _action_, an object describing what happened, and _dispatch_ it to the store.
To specify how state gets updated in response to an action, you write pure _reducer_ functions that calculate a new state based on the old state and the action.

```js
import { createStore } from 'redux'

/**
 * This is a reducer - a function that takes a current state value and an
 * action object describing "what happened", and returns a new state value.
 * A reducer's function signature is: (state, action) => newState
 *
 * The Redux state should contain only plain JS objects, arrays, and primitives.
 * The root state value is usually an object.  It's important that you should
 * not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes.
 *
 * You can use any conditional logic you want in a reducer. In this example,
 * we use a switch statement, but it's not required.
 */
function counterReducer(state = { value: 0 }, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'counter/incremented':
      return { value: state.value + 1 }
    case 'counter/decremented':
      return { value: state.value - 1 }
    default:
      return state
  }
}

// Create a Redux store holding the state of your app.
// Its API is { subscribe, dispatch, getState }.
let store = createStore(counterReducer)

// You can use subscribe() to update the UI in response to state changes.
// Normally you'd use a view binding library (e.g. React Redux) rather than subscribe() directly.
// There may be additional use cases where it's helpful to subscribe as well.

store.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))

// The only way to mutate the internal state is to dispatch an action.
// The actions can be serialized, logged or stored and later replayed.
store.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })
// {value: 1}
store.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })
// {value: 2}
store.dispatch({ type: 'counter/decremented' })
// {value: 1}
```

Instead of mutating the state directly, you specify the mutations you want to happen with plain objects called _actions_. Then you write a special function called a _reducer_ to decide how every action transforms the entire application's state.

In a typical Redux app, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function. As your app grows, you split the root reducer into smaller reducers independently operating on the different parts of the state tree. This is exactly like how there is just one root component in a React app, but it is composed out of many small components.

This architecture might seem like a lot for a counter app, but the beauty of this pattern is how well it scales to large and complex apps. It also enables very powerful developer tools, because it is possible to trace every mutation to the action that caused it. You can record user sessions and reproduce them just by replaying every action.

### Redux Toolkit Example

Redux Toolkit simplifies the process of writing Redux logic and setting up the store. With Redux Toolkit, that same logic looks like:

```js
import { createSlice, configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: {
    value: 0
  },
  reducers: {
    incremented: state => {
      // Redux Toolkit allows us to write "mutating" logic in reducers. It
      // doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library,
      // which detects changes to a "draft state" and produces a brand new
      // immutable state based off those changes
      state.value += 1
    },
    decremented: state => {
      state.value -= 1
    }
  }
})

export const { incremented, decremented } = counterSlice.actions

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: counterSlice.reducer
})

// Can still subscribe to the store
store.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))

// Still pass action objects to `dispatch`, but they're created for us
store.dispatch(incremented())
// {value: 1}
store.dispatch(incremented())
// {value: 2}
store.dispatch(decremented())
// {value: 1}
```

Redux Toolkit allows us to write shorter logic that's easier to read, while still following the same Redux behavior and data flow.

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).

You can use Redux together with [React](https://reactjs.org), or with any other view library. It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), but has a large ecosystem of addons available.

## Installation

### Redux Toolkit

[**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic. It wraps around the Redux core, and contains packages and functions that we think are essential for building a Redux app. Redux Toolkit builds in our suggested best practices, simplifies most Redux tasks, prevents common mistakes, and makes it easier to write Redux applications.

RTK includes utilities that help simplify many common use cases, including [store setup](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/configureStore),
[creating reducers and writing immutable update logic](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createreducer),
and even [creating entire "slices" of state at once](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createslice).

Whether you're a brand new Redux user setting up your first project, or an experienced user who wants to
simplify an existing application, **[Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)** can help you
make your Redux code better.

Redux Toolkit is available as a package on NPM for use with a module bundler or in a Node application:

```bash
# NPM
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit

# Yarn
yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit
```

### Create a React Redux App

The recommended way to start new apps with React and Redux is by using the [official Redux+JS template](https://github.com/reduxjs/cra-template-redux) or [Redux+TS template](https://github.com/reduxjs/cra-template-redux-typescript) for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which takes advantage of **[Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)** and React Redux's integration with React components.

```bash
# Redux + Plain JS template
npx create-react-app my-app --template redux

# Redux + TypeScript template
npx create-react-app my-app --template redux-typescript
```

### Redux Core

The Redux core library is available as a package on NPM for use with a module bundler or in a Node application:

```bash
# NPM
npm install redux

# Yarn
yarn add redux
```

It is also available as a precompiled UMD package that defines a `window.Redux` global variable. The UMD package can be used as a [`<script>` tag](https://unpkg.com/redux/dist/redux.js) directly.

For more details, see the [Installation](Installation.md) page.

## Basic Example

The whole global state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single _store_.
The only way to change the state tree is to create an _action_, an object describing what happened, and _dispatch_ it to the store.
To specify how state gets updated in response to an action, you write pure _reducer_ functions that calculate a new state based on the old state and the action.

```js
import { createStore } from 'redux'

/**
 * This is a reducer - a function that takes a current state value and an
 * action object describing "what happened", and returns a new state value.
 * A reducer's function signature is: (state, action) => newState
 *
 * The Redux state should contain only plain JS objects, arrays, and primitives.
 * The root state value is usually an object. It's important that you should
 * not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes.
 *
 * You can use any conditional logic you want in a reducer. In this example,
 * we use a switch statement, but it's not required.
 */
function counterReducer(state = { value: 0 }, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'counter/incremented':
      return { value: state.value + 1 }
    case 'counter/decremented':
      return { value: state.value - 1 }
    default:
      return state
  }
}

// Create a Redux store holding the state of your app.
// Its API is { subscribe, dispatch, getState }.
let store = createStore(counterReducer)

// You can use subscribe() to update the UI in response to state changes.
// Normally you'd use a view binding library (e.g. React Redux) rather than subscribe() directly.
// There may be additional use cases where it's helpful to subscribe as well.

store.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))

// The only way to mutate the internal state is to dispatch an action.
// The actions can be serialized, logged or stored and later replayed.
store.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })
// {value: 1}
store.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })
// {value: 2}
store.dispatch({ type: 'counter/decremented' })
// {value: 1}
```

Instead of mutating the state directly, you specify the mutations you want to happen with plain objects called _actions_. Then you write a special function called a _reducer_ to decide how every action transforms the entire application's state.

In a typical Redux app, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function. As your app grows, you split the root reducer into smaller reducers independently operating on the different parts of the state tree. This is exactly like how there is just one root component in a React app, but it is composed out of many small components.

This architecture might seem like a lot for a counter app, but the beauty of this pattern is how well it scales to large and complex apps. It also enables very powerful developer tools, because it is possible to trace every mutation to the action that caused it. You can record user sessions and reproduce them just by replaying every action.

### Redux Toolkit Example

Redux Toolkit simplifies the process of writing Redux logic and setting up the store. With Redux Toolkit, that same logic looks like:

```js
import { createSlice, configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: {
    value: 0
  },
  reducers: {
    incremented: state => {
      // Redux Toolkit allows us to write "mutating" logic in reducers. It
      // doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library,
      // which detects changes to a "draft state" and produces a brand new
      // immutable state based off those changes
      state.value += 1
    },
    decremented: state => {
      state.value -= 1
    }
  }
})

export const { incremented, decremented } = counterSlice.actions

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: counterSlice.reducer
})

// Can still subscribe to the store
store.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))

// Still pass action objects to `dispatch`, but they're created for us
store.dispatch(incremented())
// {value: 1}
store.dispatch(incremented())
// {value: 2}
store.dispatch(decremented())
// {value: 1}
```

Redux Toolkit allows us to write shorter logic that's easier to read, while still following the same Redux behavior and data flow.

## Learn Redux

We have a variety of resources available to help you learn Redux.

### Redux Essentials Tutorial

The [**Redux Essentials tutorial**](../tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts.md) is a "top-down" tutorial that teaches "how to use Redux the right way", using our latest recommended APIs and best practices. We recommend starting there.

### Redux Fundamentals Tutorial

The [**Redux Fundamentals tutorial**](../tutorials/fundamentals/part-1-overview.md) is a "bottom-up" tutorial that teaches "how Redux works" from first principles and without any abstractions, and why standard Redux usage patterns exist.

### Learn Modern Redux Livestream

Redux maintainer Mark Erikson appeared on the "Learn with Jason" show to explain how we recommend using Redux today. The show includes a live-coded example app that shows how to use Redux Toolkit and React-Redux hooks with TypeScript, as well as the new RTK Query data fetching APIs.

See [the "Learn Modern Redux" show notes page](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/let-s-learn-modern-redux) for a transcript and links to the example app source.
