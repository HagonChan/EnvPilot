##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to install dependencies and set up a environment that is able to run the tests of the project.

- You start with an initial Docker container based on ubuntu:22.04.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- No need to clone the project again.

The final objective is to successfully run the tests of the project.


### Python-Specific Instructions:
- Make sure the package is installed from source in editable mode before running tests (e.g., `pip install -e .`)
- Avoid using tox to run tests if possible as it's designed for CI. Read tox.ini to understand setup
- Check requirements.txt, setup.py, or pyproject.toml for dependencies


================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

    Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
        <command>bash command</command>
        e.g. install build-essential: <command>apt-get install -y build-essential</command>
        e.g. view file content: <command>cat README.md</command>
    Search: search the web for if you need some information, generate query and reply with following format:
        <search>the search query</search>
        e.g. <search>how to fix 'No module named setuptools'</search>
        e.g. <search>how to install python3 on ubuntu</search>
        e.g. <search>how to create development environment for python3</search>
    Stop: stop the setup loop once you think the setup is complete, reply with following format:
        <stop></stop>
    

Observation will be the result of running those actions.


Project Structure: the structure of the project, including files and directories.
Related Files: the content of related files of the project that may help you understand the project.
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: <command>your bash command here</command> or <search>your search query</search> or other actions available
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) ...
Thought: I think the setup should be fine
Action: <stop>stop the setup</stop>
Answer: the final result

************************************
Building Astropy and its Subpackages
************************************

The build process currently uses the `setuptools
<https://setuptools.readthedocs.io>`_ package to build and install the astropy
core (and any affiliated packages that use the template). As is typical, there
is a single ``setup.py`` file that is used for the whole ``astropy`` package. To
make it easier to set up C extensions for individual sub-packages, we use
`extension-helpers <https://extension-helpers.readthedocs.io/>`_, which allows
extensions to be defined inside each sub-package.

The way extension-helpers works is that it looks for ``setup_package.py`` files
anywhere in the package, and then looks for a function called ``get_extensions``
inside each of these files. This function should return a list of
``setuptools.Extension`` objects, and these are combined into an
overall list of extensions to build.

For certain string-parsing tasks, Astropy uses the
`PLY <http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/>`_ tool.  PLY generates tables that speed up
the parsing process, which are checked into source code so they don't have to
be regenerated.  These tables can be recognized by having either ``lextab`` or
``parsetab`` in their names.  To regenerate these files (e.g. if a new version
of PLY is bundled with Astropy or some of the parsing code changes), the tables
need to be deleted and the appropriate parts of astropy re-imported and run. For
exact details, see the comments in the headers of the ``parsetab`` and
``lextab`` files.

.. _dev-build-astropy-subpkg-win:

Building on Windows
*******************

The most convenient option is to use Python installation from Miniconda. If you like
Unix-like commands, Git Bash, which comes installed with Git, complements
Miniconda pretty well, as long as Miniconda is installed with the option for
it to be available system-wide (the option that is not recommended by the
installer).

Since ``astropy`` contains C extensions, you also need to install Microsoft
Visual Studio (the latest available should work) so Python can access the
system C compiler.

Once everything is set up as above, you can proceed to build ``astropy``
from source in the ``conda`` environment in an OS-agnostic way. For example:

* Create a new ``conda`` environment.
* Go to the ``astropy`` code checkout directory.
* If you have not already, fetch all of the tags from the main repository.
  If you do not have the latest tag, your developer version number will be
  wrong.
* Run ``pip install -e .`` to build ``astropy``.

*******************************
How to make a code contribution
*******************************

This document outlines the process for contributing code to the Astropy
project.

**Already experienced with git? Contributed before?** Jump right to
:ref:`astropy-git`.

Pre-requisites
**************

Before following the steps in this document you need:

+ an account on `GitHub`_
+ a local copy of the astropy source. Instructions for doing that, including the
  basics you need for setting up git and GitHub, are at :ref:`get_devel`.

Strongly Recommended, but not required
**************************************

You cannot easily work on the development version of astropy in a python
environment in which you also use the stable version. It can be done |emdash|
but can only be done *successfully* if you always remember whether the
development version or stable version is the active one.

:ref:`virtual_envs` offer a better solution and take only a few minutes to set
up. It is well worth your time.

Not sure what your first contribution should be? Take a look at the `Astropy
issue list`_ and grab one labeled `"package-novice" <https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Apackage-novice>`_.
These issues are the most accessible ones if you are not familiar with the
Astropy source code. Issues labeled as `"effort-low" <https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aeffort-low>`_
are expected to take a few hours (at most) to address, while the
`"effort-medium" <https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aeffort-medium>`_
ones may take a few days. The developers are friendly and want you to help, so
don't be shy about asking questions on the `astropy-dev mailing list`_.

New to `git`_?
**************

Some `git`_ resources
=====================

If you have never used git or have limited experience with it, take a few
minutes to look at these resources:

* `Interactive tutorial`_ that runs in a browser
* `Git Basics`_, part of a much longer `git book`_.

In practice, you need only a handful of `git`_ commands to make contributions
to Astropy. There is a more extensive list of :ref:`git-resources` if you
want more background.

Double check your setup
=======================

Before going further, make sure you have set up astropy as described in
:ref:`get_devel`.

In a terminal window, change directory to the one containing your clone of
Astropy. Then, run ``git remote``; the output should look something like this::

    your-github-username
    astropy

If that works, also run ``git fetch --all``. If it runs without errors then
your installation is working and you have a complete list of all branches in
your clone, ``your-github-username`` and ``astropy``.

About names in `git`_
=====================

`git`_ is designed to be a *distributed* version control system. Each clone of
a repository is, itself, a repository. That can lead to some confusion,
especially for the branch called ``main``. If you list all of the branches
your clone of git knows about with ``git branch -a`` you will see there are
*three* different branches called ``main``::

    * main                              # this is main in your local repo
    remotes/your-github-username/main   # main on your fork of Astropy on GitHub
    remotes/astropy/main                # the official development branch of Astropy

The naming scheme used by `git`_ will also be used here. A plain branch name,
like ``main`` means a branch in your local copy of Astropy. A branch on a
remote, like ``astropy`` , is labeled by that remote, ``astropy/main``.

This duplication of names can get very confusing when working with pull
requests, especially when the official main branch, ``astropy/main``,
changes due to other contributions before your contributions are merged in.
As a result, you should never do any work in your main
branch, ``main``. Always work on a branch instead.

Essential `git`_ commands
=========================

A full `git`_ tutorial is beyond the scope of this document but this list
describes the few ``git`` commands you are likely to encounter in contributing
to Astropy:

* ``git fetch`` gets the latest development version of Astropy, which you will
  use as the basis for making your changes.
* ``git branch`` makes a logically separate copy of Astropy to keep track of
  your changes.
* ``git add`` stages files you have changed or created for addition to `git`_.
* ``git commit`` adds your staged changes to the repository.
* ``git push`` copies the changes you committed to GitHub
* ``git status`` to see a list of files that have been modified or created.

.. note::
    A good graphical interface to git makes some of these steps much
    easier. Some options are described in :ref:`git_gui_options`.

If something goes wrong
=======================

`git`_ provides a number of ways to recover from errors. If you end up making a
`git`_ mistake, do not hesitate to ask for help. An additional resource that
walks you through recovering from `git`_ mistakes is the
`git choose-your-own-adventure`_.

.. _astropy-git:

Astropy Guidelines for `git`_
*****************************

* Don't use your ``main`` branch for anything. Consider :ref:`delete-main`.
* Make a new branch, called a *feature branch*, for each separable set of
  changes: "one task, one branch" (`ipython git workflow`_).
* Start that new *feature branch* from the most current development version
  of astropy (instructions are below).
* Name your branch for the purpose of the changes, for example
  ``bugfix-for-issue-14`` or ``refactor-database-code``.
* Make frequent commits, and always include a commit message. Each commit
  should represent one logical set of changes.
* Ask on the `astropy-dev mailing list`_ if you get stuck.
* Never merge changes from ``astropy/main`` into your feature branch. If
  changes in the development version require changes to our code you can
  :ref:`rebase`.

In addition there are a couple of `git`_ naming conventions used in this
document:

* Change the name of the remote ``origin`` to ``your-github-username``.
* Name the remote that is the primary Astropy repository
  ``astropy``; in prior versions of this documentation it was referred to as
  ``upstream``.

Workflow
********

These, conceptually, are the steps you will follow in contributing to Astropy:

#. :ref:`fetch-latest`
#. :ref:`make-feature-branch`; you will make your changes on this branch.
#. :ref:`install-branch`
#. Follow :ref:`edit-flow` to write/edit/document/test code - make
   frequent, small commits.
#. :ref:`add-changelog`
#. :ref:`push-to-github`
#. From GitHub, :ref:`pull-request` to let the Astropy maintainers know
   you have contributions to review.
#. :ref:`revise and push` in response to comments on the pull
   request. Pushing those changes to GitHub automatically updates the
   pull request.

This way of working helps to keep work well organized, with readable history.
This in turn makes it easier for project maintainers (that might be you) to
see what you've done, and why you did it.

A worked example that follows these steps for fixing an Astropy issue is at
:ref:`astropy-fix-example`.

Some additional topics related to `git`_ are in :ref:`additional-git`.

.. _delete-main:

Deleting your main branch
=========================

It may sound strange, but deleting your own ``main`` branch can help reduce
confusion about which branch you are on.  See `deleting main on github`_ for
details.

.. _fetch-latest:

Fetch the latest Astropy
************************

From time to time you should fetch the development version (i.e. Astropy
``astropy/main``) changes from GitHub::

   git fetch astropy --tags

This will pull down any commits you don't have, and set the remote branches to
point to the latest commit. For example, 'trunk' is the branch referred to by
``astropy/main``, and if there have been commits since
you last checked, ``astropy/main`` will change after you do the fetch.

.. _make-feature-branch:

Make a new feature branch
*************************

Make the new branch
===================

When you are ready to make some changes to the code, you should start a new
branch. Branches that are for a collection of related edits are often called
'feature branches'.

Making a new branch for each set of related changes will make it easier for
someone reviewing your branch to see what you are doing.

Choose an informative name for the branch to remind yourself and the rest of us
what the changes in the branch are for. Branch names like ``add-ability-to-fly``
or ``buxfix-for-issue-42`` clearly describe the purpose of the branch.

Always make your branch from ``astropy/main`` so that you are basing your
changes on the latest version of Astropy::

    # Update the mirror of trunk
    git fetch astropy --tags

    # Make new feature branch starting at astropy/main
    git branch my-new-feature astropy/main
    git checkout my-new-feature

Connect the branch to GitHub
============================

At this point you have made and checked out a new branch, but `git`_ does not
know it should be connected to your fork on GitHub. You need that connection
for your proposed changes to be managed by the Astropy maintainers on GitHub.

The most convenient way for connecting your local branch to GitHub is to `git
push`_ this new branch up to your GitHub repo with the ``--set-upstream``
option::

   git push --set-upstream your-github-username my-new-feature

From now on git will know that ``my-new-feature`` is related to the
``your-github-username/my-new-feature`` branch in your GitHub fork of Astropy.

You will still need to ``git push`` your changes to GitHub periodically. The
setup in this section will make that easier because any following pushes of
this branch can be performed without having to write out the remote and branch
names.

.. _install-branch:

Install your branch
*******************

Ideally you should set up a Python virtual environment just for this fix;
instructions for doing to are at :ref:`virtual_envs`. Doing so ensures you
will not corrupt your main ``astropy`` install and makes it very easy to recover
from mistakes.

Once you have activated that environment, you need to install the version of
``astropy`` you are working on. Do that with:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e .

For more details on building ``astropy`` from source, see
:ref:`dev-build-astropy-subpkg`.

.. _edit-flow:

The editing workflow
********************

Conceptually, you will:

#. Make changes to one or more files and/or add a new file.
#. Check that your changes do not break existing code.
#. Add documentation to your code and, as appropriate, to the Astropy
   documentation.
#. Ideally, also make sure your changes do not break the documentation.
#. Add tests of the code you contribute.
#. Commit your changes in `git`_
#. Repeat as necessary.


In more detail
==============

#. Make some changes to one or more files. You should follow the Astropy
   :ref:`code-guide`. Each logical set of changes should be treated as one
   commit. For example, if you are fixing a known bug in Astropy and notice
   a different bug while implementing your fix, implement the fix to that new
   bug as a different set of changes.

#. Test that your changes do not lead to *regressions*, i.e. that your
   changes do not break existing code, by running the Astropy tests. You can
   run all of the Astropy tests from ipython with::

     import astrop
... (truncated due to size)

##### LLM OUTPUT #####
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Thought: The timeout issue with Python 3.8 installation seems persistent. Let's try using the default Python 3 version that comes with Ubuntu 22.04 (which is Python 3.10) instead, as it should be more straightforward to install.
