This guide is aimed at giving a quick introduction for those wishing to
develop their own extensions for Sphinx. Sphinx possesses significant
extensibility capabilities including the ability to hook into almost every
point of the build process.  If you simply wish to use Sphinx with existing
extensions, refer to :doc:`/usage/index`. For a more detailed discussion of
the extension interface see :doc:`/extdev/index`.
