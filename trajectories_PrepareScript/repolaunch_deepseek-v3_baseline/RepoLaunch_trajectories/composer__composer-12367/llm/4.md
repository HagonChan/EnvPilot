##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

### File:
------ START FILE PORTING_INFO ------
 * add rule
 *  p = direct literal; always < 0 for installed rpm rules
 *  d, if < 0 direct literal, if > 0 offset into whatprovides, if == 0 rule is assertion (look at p only)
 *
 *
 * A requires b, b provided by B1,B2,B3 => (-A|B1|B2|B3)
 *
 * p < 0 : pkg id of A
 * d > 0 : Offset in whatprovidesdata (list of providers of b)
 *
 * A conflicts b, b provided by B1,B2,B3 => (-A|-B1), (-A|-B2), (-A|-B3)
 * p < 0 : pkg id of A
 * d < 0 : Id of solvable (e.g. B1)
 *
 * d == 0: unary rule, assertion => (A) or (-A)
 *
 *   Install:    p > 0, d = 0   (A)             user requested install
 *   Remove:     p < 0, d = 0   (-A)            user requested remove (also: uninstallable)
 *   Requires:   p < 0, d > 0   (-A|B1|B2|...)  d: <list of providers for requirement of p>
 *   Updates:    p > 0, d > 0   (A|B1|B2|...)   d: <list of updates for solvable p>
 *   Conflicts:  p < 0, d < 0   (-A|-B)         either p (conflict issuer) or d (conflict provider) (binary rule)
 *                                              also used for obsoletes
 *   ?:          p > 0, d < 0   (A|-B)
 *   No-op ?:    p = 0, d = 0   (null)          (used as policy rule placeholder)
 *
 *   resulting watches:
 *   ------------------
 *   Direct assertion (no watch needed)( if d <0 ) --> d = 0, w1 = p, w2 = 0
 *   Binary rule: p = first literal, d = 0, w2 = second literal, w1 = p
 *   every other : w1 = p, w2 = whatprovidesdata[d];
 *   Disabled rule: w1 = 0
 *
 *   always returns a rule for non-rpm rules



p > 0, d = 0, (A), w1 = p, w2 = 0
p < 0, d = 0, (-A), w1 = p, w2 = 0
p !=0, d = 0, (p|q), w1 = p, w2 = q
