##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

### File:
------ START FILE update_fuel_dependencies.sh ------
#!/bin/bash

# Run this script to only bump fuel maintained dependencies. 
#
# We currently pin dependencies using "X.Y" in the root Cargo.toml file.
# Since `cargo build` does not check for minor version bumps at each invocation
# it is hard to move between new versions, especially for minor bumps which
# happens much often. Use this script to keep every fuel owned dependency up to
# date.

# Define the list of fuel maintained crates
crates=(
    "fuel-abi-types"
    "fuel-core-client"
    "fuel-core-types"
    "fuels"
    "fuels-core"
    "fuels-accounts"
    "fuel-asm"
    "fuel-crypto"
    "fuel-types"
    "fuel-tx"
    "fuel-vm"
    "forc-wallet"
)

# Run `cargo update -p <crate_name>` for each fuel owned crate. 
for crate in "${crates[@]}"; do
    echo "Updating package: $crate"
    cargo update -p "$crate"
done

------ END FILE update_fuel_dependencies.sh ------
