##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to install dependencies and set up a environment that is able to run the tests of the project.

- You start with an initial Docker container based on ubuntu:22.04.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- No need to clone the project again.

The final objective is to successfully run the tests of the project.


### Rust-Specific Instructions:
- Use `cargo build` to build the project
- Use `cargo test` to run tests
- Use `cargo check` for faster compilation checks
- Install system dependencies if needed (check Cargo.toml for sys crates)
- Consider using `cargo install` for binary dependencies


================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

    Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
        <command>bash command</command>
        e.g. install build-essential: <command>apt-get install -y build-essential</command>
        e.g. view file content: <command>cat README.md</command>
    Search: search the web for if you need some information, generate query and reply with following format:
        <search>the search query</search>
        e.g. <search>how to fix 'No module named setuptools'</search>
        e.g. <search>how to install python3 on ubuntu</search>
        e.g. <search>how to create development environment for python3</search>
    Stop: stop the setup loop once you think the setup is complete, reply with following format:
        <stop></stop>
    

Observation will be the result of running those actions.


Project Structure: the structure of the project, including files and directories.
Related Files: the content of related files of the project that may help you understand the project.
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: <command>your bash command here</command> or <search>your search query</search> or other actions available
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) ...
Thought: I think the setup should be fine
Action: <stop>stop the setup</stop>
Answer: the final result

Begin!

Sway is a language developed for the [Fuel](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/intro/what-is-fuel/) blockchain. It is heavily inspired by Rust and aims to bring modern language development and performance to the blockchain ecosystem.

## Documentation

For user documentation, including installing release builds, see the Sway Book: <https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/latest/>.

For Sway Standard library documentation, see: <https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/master/std/>

Also view the technical reference for the Sway programming language: <https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/master/reference/>

## Building from Source

This section is for developing the Sway compiler and toolchain. For developing contracts and using Sway, see the above documentation section.

### Dependencies

Sway is built in Rust. To begin, install the Rust toolchain following instructions at <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>. Then configure your Rust toolchain to use Rust `stable`:

```sh
rustup default stable
```

If not already done, add the Cargo bin directory to your `PATH` by adding the following line to `~/.profile` and restarting the shell session.

```sh
export PATH="${HOME}/.cargo/bin:${PATH}"
```

### Building Forc

Clone the repository and build the Sway toolchain:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:FuelLabs/sway.git
cd sway
cargo build
```

Confirm the Sway toolchain built successfully:

```sh
cargo run --bin forc -- --help
```

## Contributing to Sway

We welcome contributions to Sway!

Please see the [Contributing To Sway](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/master/book/reference/contributing_to_sway.html) section of the Sway book for guidelines and instructions to help you get started.

Thought: The error indicates that the wasm32-unknown-unknown target is not installed, which is required to build fuel-core. We need to install this Rust target before proceeding.
