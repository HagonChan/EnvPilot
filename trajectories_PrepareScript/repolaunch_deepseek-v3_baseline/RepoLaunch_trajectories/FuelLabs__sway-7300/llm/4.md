```

If not already done, add the Cargo bin directory to your `PATH` by adding the following line to `~/.profile` and restarting the shell session.

```sh
export PATH="${HOME}/.cargo/bin:${PATH}"
```

### Building Forc

```sh
git clone git@github.com:FuelLabs/sway.git
cd sway
cargo build
```

Confirm the Sway toolchain built successfully:
