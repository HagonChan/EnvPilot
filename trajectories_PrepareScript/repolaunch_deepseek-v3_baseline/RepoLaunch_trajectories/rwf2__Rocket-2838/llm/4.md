================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

# Quickstart

Before you can start writing a Rocket application, you'll need to install the
Rust toolchain. We recommend using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). If you don't
have Rust installed and would like extra guidance doing so, see [Getting
Started].

## Running Examples

The absolute fastest way to start experimenting with Rocket is to clone the
Rocket repository and run the included examples in the `examples/` directory.
For instance, the following set of commands runs the `hello` example:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket
cd Rocket
git checkout master
cd examples/hello
cargo run
```

There are numerous examples in the `examples/` directory. They can all be run
with `cargo run`.

! note

  The examples' `Cargo.toml` files will point to the locally cloned `rocket`
  libraries. When copying the examples for your own use, you should modify the
  `Cargo.toml` files as explained in the [Getting Started] guide.
