This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

# [Blueprint](http://blueprintjs.com/) Popover2 & Tooltip2 Components

Blueprint is a React UI toolkit for the web.

This package contains re-exports of popover-related components from @blueprintjs/core. These "V2" components were
previously available in @blueprintjs/popover v4.x, but they were promoted to the standard "V1" components in
@blueprintjs/core v5.x.

Once you upgrade to Blueprint v5.0, you should migrate your imports to the @blueprintjs/core package.
See the [Popover2 migration guide](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/wiki/Popover2-migration) for more info.

```diff
- import { Popover2 } from "@blueprintjs/popover2";
+ import { Popover } from "@blueprintjs/core";
```
