================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

# [Blueprint](http://blueprintjs.com/) Date & Time Components (V2)

Blueprint is a React UI toolkit for the web.

This package contains next-generation components for interacting with dates & times.

Compared to the "V1" components in @blueprintjs/datetime, the "V3" components in this package:

-   use [react-day-picker](https://react-day-picker.js.org/) v8 instead of v7 (this unblocks React 18 compatibility)
-   are easier to internationalize & localize since date-fns is now a dependency (instead of `localeUtils`, you can specify a locale code and we'll automatically load the date-fns locale object)

This package also contains legacy APIs which are re-exported aliases for components from @blueprintjs/datetime v5.x.
These "V2" names are backwards-compatible with @blueprintjs/datetime2 v0.x.

To migrate to the latest "V3" components, follow the [react-day-picker v8 migration guide](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/wiki/react-day-picker-8-migration).

Note that @blueprintjs/datetime2 will transitively install multiple versions of react-day-picker.
These two copies of react-day-picker can happily exist together in a single JS bundle, and with the help of tree-shaking,
you can avoid bundling both if you _only_ use the deprecated "V1" / "V2" datetime components or _only_ use the new
"V3" APIs.
