##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to install dependencies and set up a environment that is able to run the tests of the project.

- You start with an initial Docker container based on ubuntu:22.04.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- No need to clone the project again.

The final objective is to successfully run the tests of the project.


### TypeScript-Specific Instructions:
- Use npm, yarn, or pnpm to install dependencies (check package.json and lockfiles)
- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies
- Check package.json for test scripts and build commands
- Consider using `npm ci` for faster, reproducible builds if package-lock.json exists
- Install TypeScript globally if needed (e.g., `npm install -g typescript`)


================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

    Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
        <command>bash command</command>
        e.g. install build-essential: <command>apt-get install -y build-essential</command>
        e.g. view file content: <command>cat README.md</command>
    Search: search the web for if you need some information, generate query and reply with following format:
        <search>the search query</search>
        e.g. <search>how to fix 'No module named setuptools'</search>
        e.g. <search>how to install python3 on ubuntu</search>
        e.g. <search>how to create development environment for python3</search>
    Stop: stop the setup loop once you think the setup is complete, reply with following format:
        <stop></stop>
    

Observation will be the result of running those actions.


Project Structure: the structure of the project, including files and directories.
Related Files: the content of related files of the project that may help you understand the project.
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: <command>your bash command here</command> or <search>your search query</search> or other actions available
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) ...
Thought: I think the setup should be fine
Action: <stop>stop the setup</stop>
Answer: the final result

# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada: :confetti_ball: :+1:

## Getting started

Looking for places to contribute to the codebase? Check out the
["help wanted"](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/labels/help%20wanted) label.

### Installation

First, ensure you have a compatible version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
installed on your machine. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and running `nvm use` in
the repo to switch to right version of Node.

If you are a Palantir employee, you may join the [Palantir Github organization](https://github.com/palantir/)
through the internal OSS portal to gain write access to the Blueprint repository. This allows you to push
branches directly to this repo without forking.

For all external contributors, you will have to fork the Blueprint repo in order to contribute code.

Clone your fork onto your machine and then run the following commands to install dependencies and run a cold
build. Make sure you have an [SSH key set up with your Github account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account#adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-account).

```sh
git clone git@github.com:<username>/blueprint.git
cd blueprint
yarn
yarn compile
yarn dist
```

## Developing

A typical contributor workflow looks like this:

1. Create a new feature branch. We like to use a format like `[your-initials]/[short-name]`:
   for example, `bd/refactor-buttons`.
1. Run development build tasks - follow the ["Developing libraries" steps in the README](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/blob/develop/README.md#developing-libraries).
1. Visit http://localhost:9000 in your web browser to see the interactive docs web app.
4. Write some code. :hammer: **Refer to the wiki in this repo for detailed instructions on:**
    - [Development practices](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/wiki/Development-practices)
    - [Coding guidelines](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/wiki/Coding-guidelines)
    - [Editor integration](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/wiki/Editor-integration)
5. Ensure your code **compiles properly** and is **tested**, **linted**, and **formatted**.
    - Run `yarn compile` at the repo root to build all libraries.
    - Run `yarn bundle` at the repo root to build the Blueprint documentation and other bundles.
    - Add unit tests as necessary when fixing bugs or adding features; run them with `yarn test`
      in the relevant package directory.
    - Linting is best handled by your editor for real-time feedback (see
      [Editor integration](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/wiki/Editor-integration)). Run
      `yarn lint` to be 100% safe.
    - TypeScript lint errors can often be automatically fixed by ESLint. Run lint fixes with `yarn lint-fix`.
    - Code formatting is enforced using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). These errors can be fixed in your editor
      through ESLint (make sure you have set up the editor integrations linked above).
      __Formatting checks will not run__ during the `yarn lint` package script.
      Instead, when using the CLI or in a CI environment, you should run the `yarn format` script to fix all
      formatting issues across the Blueprint monorepo.
1. Submit a Pull Request on GitHub and fill out the template.
    - ⚠️ __DO NOT enable CircleCI for your fork of Blueprint.__ When you open a PR, your branch will be checked out
      and built in palantir's CI pipeline automatically. There is no need to enable the CI build for your fork's
      pipeline. If you do, this may cause problems in the CI build.
      - If you have already opened a PR where CircleCI built the code in your own personal or organization pipeline,
        you will likely have to disable the project from building at app.circleci.com/settings/project/github/\<your-username\>/website
        and open a new PR.
1. Team members will review your code and merge it after approvals.
    - You may be asked to make modifications to code style or to fix bugs you may have not noticed.
    - Please respond to comments in a timely fashion (even if to tell us you need more time).
    - _Do not_ amend commits and `push --force` as they break the PR history. Please add more commits; we squash each PR to a single commit on merge.
1. Hooray, you contributed! :tophat:

# [Blueprint](http://blueprintjs.com/) [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) plugin

Blueprint is a React UI toolkit for the web.

This package contains the [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) plugin for Blueprint. It provides custom rules which are useful when developing against Blueprint libraries.

**Key features:**

-   [Blueprint-specific rules](#Rules) for use with `@blueprintjs` components.

## Installation

```
yarn add --dev @blueprintjs/stylelint-plugin
```

## Usage

Simply add this plugin in your `.stylelintrc` file and then pick the rules that you need. The plugin includes Blueprint-specific rules which enforce semantics particular to usage with `@blueprintjs` packages, but does not turn them on by default.

`.stylelintrc`

```json
{
    "plugins": [
        "@blueprintjs/stylelint-plugin"
    ],
    "rules": {
        "@blueprintjs/no-color-literal": true,
        "@blueprintjs/no-prefix-literal": true
    }
}
```

## Rules

### `@blueprintjs/no-color-literal` (autofixable)

Enforce usage of the color variables instead of color literals.

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "@blueprintjs/no-color-literal": true
    }
}
```

```diff
-.my-class {
-    border: 1px solid #137CBD;
-}
+ @use "@blueprintjs/core/lib/scss/variables.scss" as bp;
+
+.my-class {
+    border: 1px solid bp.$blue3;
+}
```

Optional secondary options:

- `disableFix: boolean` - if true, autofix will be disabled
- `variablesImportPath: { less?: string, sass?: string }` - can be used to configure a custom path for importing Blueprint variables when autofixing.


### `@blueprintjs/no-prefix-literal` (autofixable)

Enforce usage of the `bp-ns` constant over namespaced string literals.

The `@blueprintjs` package exports a `bp-ns` CSS variable which contains the prefix for the current version of Blueprint (`bp3` for Blueprint 3, `bp4` for Blueprint 4, and etc).
Using the variable instead of hardcoding the prefix means that your code will still work when new major version of Blueprint is released.

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "@blueprintjs/no-prefix-literal": true
    }
}
```

```diff
-.bp3-button > div {
-    border: 1px solid black;
-}
+ @use "@blueprintjs/core/lib/scss/variables.scss" as bp;
+
+.#{bp.$ns}-button > div {
+    border: 1px solid black;
+}
```

Optional secondary options:

- `disableFix: boolean` - if true, autofix will be disabled
- `variablesImportPath: { less?: string, sass?: string }` - can be used to configure a custom path for importing Blueprint variables when autofixing.

## Note: This package is deprecated in favour of `@blueprintjs/eslint-plugin`

[TSLint is deprecated](https://medium.com/palantir/tslint-in-2019-1a144c2317a9), and as such Blueprint is transitioning to ESLint. Blueprint is now using ESLint in its own repository, and as such this package will be removed in a future major version.

# [Blueprint](http://blueprintjs.com/) [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint) configuration

Blueprint is a React UI toolkit for the web.

This package contains configuration for [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint) (the TypeScript linter) and a handful of new rules specifically for use when developing against Blueprint libraries.

**Key features:**

-   React & JSX rules from [tslint-react](https://github.com/palantir/tslint-react).
-   [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) integration for consistent code style and automatic fixes.
-   [Blueprint-specific rules](#Rules) for use with `@blueprintjs` components.

## Installation

```
yarn add @blueprintjs/tslint-config tslint
```

## Usage

Simply extend this package in your `tslint.json` to use the default rules configuration. This configuration includes Blueprint-specific rules which enforce semantics particular to usage with `@blueprintjs` packages.

`tslint.json`

```json
{
    "extends": "@blueprintjs/tslint-config"
}
```

### Rules-only usage

To enable the Blueprint-specific rules _only_ without the full TSLint config, extend the `blueprint-rules` config inside the package:

`tslint.json`

```diff
{
  "extends": [
+   "@blueprintjs/tslint-config/blueprint-rules"
  ]
}
```

### Editor integration

⭐️ **VS Code:** Enable the `tslint.autoFixOnSave` option to fix all fixable failures every time you save. Most importantly, this will automatically apply the Prettier formatting fixes!

## Rules

### `blueprint-classes-constants`

Enforce usage of `Classes` constants over namespaced string literals.

Each `@blueprintjs` package exports a `Classes` object that contains constants for every CSS class defined by the package. While the values of the constants may change between releases, the names of the constants will remain more stable.

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "blueprint-classes-constants": true
    }
}
```

```diff
-const element = <div className="pt-navbar" />;
+const element = <div className={Classes.NAVBAR} />;
```

### `blueprint-icon-components`

Enforce usage of JSX `Icon` components over `IconName` string literals (or vice-versa) in `icon` JSX props. Note that this rule only supports hardcoded values in the `icon` prop; it does not handle expressions or conditionals.

A fixer is available for this rule that will convert between string literals and named `Icon` components. Note that the implementation is naive and may require intervention, such as to import a component or fix an invalid name.

Named icon components (`TickIcon`, `GraphIcon`, etc) can be imported from the `@blueprintjs/icons` package.

This rule is disabled in the `blueprint-rules` config as it is most useful to ensure that the `@blueprintjs/icons` package can be tree-shaken (an opt-in process which requires using components and _never_ `IconName` literals).

```js
{
  "rules": {
    // default uses "component"
    "blueprint-icon-components": true,
    // expanded syntax
    "blueprint-icon-components": {
      "options": ["component" | "literal"] // choose one
    }
  }
}
```

`"component"`

```diff
-<Button icon="tick" />
+<Button icon={<TickIcon />} />
```

`"literal"`

```diff
-<Button icon={<GraphIcon />} />
+<Button icon="graph" />
```

# [Blueprint](http://blueprintjs.com/) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/palantir/blueprint/tree/develop.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/palantir/workflows/blueprint)

Blueprint is a React-based UI toolkit for the web.

It is optimized for building complex, data-dense web interfaces for _desktop applications_ which run in modern browsers.
This is not a mobile-first UI toolkit.

## Packages

This repository contains multiple projects in the `packages/` directory that fall into 3 categories:

### Libraries

These are the component libraries we publish to NPM.

### Applications

These are hosted on GitHub Pages as static web applications:

-   `docs-app` &ndash; Documentation site at blueprintjs.com/docs
-   `landing-app` &ndash; Landing page at blueprintjs.com

These are used as development playground environments:

-   `demo-app` &ndash; demo page that shows many components all on the same page in light and dark themes
-   `table-dev-app` &ndash; demo page that supports manual testing of all table features

### Build tooling

These packages define development dependencies and contain build configuration. They adhere to the standard NPM package layout, which allows us to keep clear API boundaries for build configuration and isolate groups of `devDependencies`. They are published to NPM in order to allow other Blueprint-related projects to use this infrastructure outside this monorepo.

-   [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@blueprintjs/docs-theme.svg?label=@blueprintjs/docs-theme)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blueprintjs/docs-theme) &ndash; Documentation theme for [Documentalist](https://github.com/palantir/documentalist) data.

## Contributing

Looking for places to contribute to the codebase?
First read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md),
then [check out the "help wanted" label](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/labels/help%20wanted).

## Development

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) manages third-party and inter-package dependencies in this monorepo.
Builds are orchestrated via [Nx's task runner](https://nx.dev/getting-started/intro) and NPM scripts.
[Lerna-Lite](https://github.com/lerna-lite/lerna-lite) is used to prepare releases.

**Prerequisites**: Node.js v18+ (see version specified in `.nvmrc`), Yarn v4.x (see version specified in `package.json`)

### One-time setup

First, ensure you have `nvm` ([Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)) installed.

After cloning this repo, run:

1. `nvm use` to use the supported Node version for Blueprint development.
1. `corepack enable` to activate [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started) as the Node package manager.
1. `yarn` to install all dependencies for the monorepo.
   1. If seeing an error like "Error when performing the request ...", you may be using a VPN that needs to be disabled to install the dependencies.
1. If running on Windows:
    1. `npm install -g windows-build-tools` to install build tools globally
    1. Ensure `bash` is your configured script-shell by running:<br />
       `npm config set script-shell "C:\\Program Files\\git\\bin\\bash.exe"`
1. `yarn verify` to ensure you have all the build tooling working properly.

### Incorporating upstream changes

If you were previously in a working state and have just pulled new code from `develop`:

-   If there were package dependency changes, run `yarn` at the root.
    -   This command is very quick if there are no new things to install.
-   Run `yarn compile` to get the latest built versions of the library packages in this repo.
    -   This command is quicker than `yarn verify` since it doesn't build the application packages (`docs-app`,
        `landing-app`, etc.) or run tests

### Developing libraries

There are a few ways to run development scripts, here they are listed from simplest to more advanced usage:

-   Run `yarn dev` from the root directory to watch changes across all packages and run the docs application with
    webpack-dev-server.
-   Alternately, most libraries have a dev script to run the docs app _and_ watch changes to only that package:
    -   `yarn dev:core`
    -   `yarn dev:docs`
    -   `yarn dev:datetime`
    -   `yarn dev:select`
    -   `yarn dev:table`
-   Lastly, if you want to control exactly which dev scripts are run and view

Thought: Node.js v18 is now installed. Next, I need to install Yarn v4.x as specified in the package.json and run the project setup.
