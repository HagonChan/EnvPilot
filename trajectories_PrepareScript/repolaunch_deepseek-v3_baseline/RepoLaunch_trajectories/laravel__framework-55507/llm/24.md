##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

### File:
------ START FILE bin/release.sh ------
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -e

# Make sure the release tag is provided.
if (( "$#" != 1 ))
then
    echo "Tag has to be provided."

    exit 1
fi

RELEASE_BRANCH="12.x"
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
VERSION=$1

# Make sure current branch and release branch match.
if [[ "$RELEASE_BRANCH" != "$CURRENT_BRANCH" ]]
then
    echo "Release branch ($RELEASE_BRANCH) does not match the current active branch ($CURRENT_BRANCH)."

    exit 1
fi

# Make sure the working directory is clear.
if [[ ! -z "$(git status --porcelain)" ]]
then
    echo "Your working directory is dirty. Did you forget to commit your changes?"

    exit 1
fi

# Make sure latest changes are fetched first.
git fetch origin

# Make sure that release branch is in sync with origin.
if [[ $(git rev-parse HEAD) != $(git rev-parse origin/$RELEASE_BRANCH) ]]
then
    echo "Your branch is out of date with its upstream. Did you forget to pull or push any changes before releasing?"

    exit 1
fi

# Always prepend with "v"
if [[ $VERSION != v*  ]]
then
    VERSION="v$VERSION"
