## about

*baggageclaim* allows you to create and layer volumes on a remote server. This
is particularly useful when used with [bind mounts][bind-mounts] or the RootFS
when using [Garden][garden]. It allows directories to be made which can be
populated before having copy-on-write layers layered on top. e.g. to provide
caching.
