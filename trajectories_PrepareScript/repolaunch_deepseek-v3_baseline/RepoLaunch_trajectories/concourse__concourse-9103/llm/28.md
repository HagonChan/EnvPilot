##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

### File:
------ START FILE skymarshal/README.md ------

# skymarshal

Concourse Skymarshal is responsible for issuing tokens that will be consumed by the `atc`. They should be statically verifiable and contain all required openid connect claims, as well as a `groups` claim for verifying concourse `team` membership. 

This library is a thin wrapper around [coreos/dex](http://github.com/coreos/dex).

### Future considerations

We want to investigate the ability to grant personal access tokens. This should just be a matter of exchanging the personal access token for a concourse token which contains all necessary claims.
