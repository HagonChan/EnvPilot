================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

### File:
------ START FILE versions.go ------
package concourse

// Version is the version of Concourse. This variable is overridden at build
// time in the pipeline using ldflags.
var Version = "0.0.0-dev"

// WorkerVersion identifies compatibility between Concourse and a worker.
//
// Backwards-incompatible changes to the worker API should result in a major
// version bump.
//
// New features that are otherwise backwards-compatible should result in a
// minor version bump.
var WorkerVersion = "2.5"

------ END FILE versions.go ------
