##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to install dependencies and set up a environment that is able to run the tests of the project.

- You start with an initial Docker container based on ubuntu:22.04.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- No need to clone the project again.

The final objective is to successfully run the tests of the project.


### JavaScript/Node.js-Specific Instructions:
- Use npm, yarn, or pnpm to install dependencies (check package.json and lockfiles)
- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies
- Check package.json for test scripts and build commands
- Consider using `npm ci` for faster, reproducible builds if package-lock.json exists
- Install global dependencies if needed (e.g., `npm install -g typescript`)


================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

    Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
        <command>bash command</command>
        e.g. install build-essential: <command>apt-get install -y build-essential</command>
        e.g. view file content: <command>cat README.md</command>
    Search: search the web for if you need some information, generate query and reply with following format:
        <search>the search query</search>
        e.g. <search>how to fix 'No module named setuptools'</search>
        e.g. <search>how to install python3 on ubuntu</search>
        e.g. <search>how to create development environment for python3</search>
    Stop: stop the setup loop once you think the setup is complete, reply with following format:
        <stop></stop>
    

Observation will be the result of running those actions.


Project Structure: the structure of the project, including files and directories.
Related Files: the content of related files of the project that may help you understand the project.
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: <command>your bash command here</command> or <search>your search query</search> or other actions available
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) ...
Thought: I think the setup should be fine
Action: <stop>stop the setup</stop>
Answer: the final result

# Contributing to KaTeX

We welcome pull requests to KaTeX. If you'd like to add a new symbol, or try to
tackle adding a larger feature, keep reading. If you have any questions, or want
help solving a problem, feel free to stop by our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/discussions).

## Helpful contributions

If you'd like to contribute, try contributing new symbols or functions that
KaTeX doesn't currently support. The documentation has pages listing
[supported functions](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html) and
[functions that KaTeX supports and some that it doesn't support](https://katex.org/docs/support_table.html).
You can check them to see if we don't support a function you like, or try your
function in the interactive demo at [https://katex.org](https://katex.org).
The wiki has a page that describes how to [examine TeX commands and where to find
rules](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/wiki/Examining-TeX) which can be quite
useful when adding new commands.

#### Single symbols

There are many individual symbols that KaTeX doesn't yet support. Read through
the [symbols.js](src/symbols.js) file for more information on how to add a
symbol.

To figure out the unicode symbol for the symbol you are trying to add, try using
the symbol in MathJax to see what unicode symbol it outputs. An interactive
MathJax shell can be found [here](https://jsfiddle.net/YpqVp/41).

To figure out what group your symbol falls into, look through the symbols list
to find other symbols of a similar kind. (e.g. if you were adding `\neq`, look
for `=`). If you cannot find anything similar, or are unsure, you can try using
your symbol in TeX surrounded by other different kinds of symbols, and seeing
whether your spacing matches the spacing that TeX produces.

Once your symbol works, check the JavaScript console to make sure you don't get
a message like `No character metrics for '_'` when you render your symbol.
If you do, check out [dockers/fonts](dockers/fonts) which generates fonts and metrics.

#### Adding new functions

New functions should be added in [src/functions](src/functions) using
`defineFunction` from [defineFunction.js](src/defineFunction.js).  Read the
comments in this file to get started.  Look at
[phantom.js](src/functions/phantom.js) and
[delimsizing.js](src/functions/delimsizing.js) as examples of how to use
`defineFunction`.  Notice how delimsizing.js groups several related functions
together in a single call to `defineFunction`.

The new method of defining functions combines methods that were previously
spread out over three different files [functions.js](src/functions.js),
[buildHTML.js](src/buildHTML.js), [buildMathML.js](src/buildMathML.js) into a
single file.  The goal is to have all functions use this new system.

#### Macros

Macros should be added in [src/macros.js](src/macros.js) using `defineMacro`.
They are expanded in the "gullet" (`MacroExpander`).

## Testing

Local testing can be done by running the webpack-dev-server using configuration
`webpack.dev.js`. Run `yarn` to install dependencies, and then `yarn start`
to start the server.

This will host an interactive editor at
[http://localhost:7936/](http://localhost:7936/) to play around with and test
changes.

#### Jest tests

The JavaScript parser and some of the HTML and MathML tree
builders are tested with Jest. These tests can be run using node with
`yarn test:jest`.  If you need to debug the tests see
[https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/troubleshooting.html](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/troubleshooting.html)

The interactive editor can also be used for debugging tests in the browser by
copy/pasting the test case to be debugged into the editor.  The permalink option
can come in really useful when doing repeated runs of the same test case.

The Jest tests should be run after every change, even the addition of small
symbols. However, [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/KaTeX/KaTeX) will run these
tests when you submit a pull request, in case you forget.

If you make any changes to Parser.js, add Jest tests to ensure they work.

Some tests verify the structure of the output tree using [snapshot testing](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/snapshot-testing.html).
Those snapshots can be updated by running `yarn test:jest:update`.

Also, test code coverage can be collected by `yarn test:jest:coverage`.
You can view the report in `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`.

#### Screenshot tests

To ensure the final output looks good, we screenshot different expressions.
These tests can be run by using the
[screenshotter docker](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/tree/main/dockers/screenshotter).

The screenshot tests should be run if you add anything more significant than
individual symbols. These tests are not automatically run, so please remember!
If the new images are different (meaning they are not byte-by-byte the same as
the old ones), inspect them visually. If there are no visible changes, that is
okay. If things change in a way consistent with your additions, explain what
changed and why. Otherwise, figure out what is causing the changes and fix it!

If you add a feature that is dependent on the final output looking the way you
created it, add a screenshot test. See
[ss_data.yaml](test/screenshotter/ss_data.yaml).

You can use our
[texcmp](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/tree/main/dockers/texcmp) tool
to compare the outputs of a screenshot test as generated by KaTeX and LaTeX.
It's often useful to attach the resulting "visual diff" to your pull request
with a new feature.

#### Testing in other browsers

KaTeX supports all major browsers, including IE 11 and newer. Unfortunately, it
is hard to test new changes in many browsers. If you can, please test your
changes in as many browsers as possible.

## Building

KaTeX is built using webpack with configuration `webpack.config.js`. Run
`yarn build` to build the project.

## Style guide

Code

 - 4 spaces for indentation
 - 80 character line length
 - commas last
 - declare variables in the outermost scope that they are used
 - camelCase for variables in JavaScript
 - snake_case for variables in Python

In general, try to make your code blend in with the surrounding code.

The code can be linted by running `yarn test:lint`, which lints JavaScript
files using ESLint and stylesheets using stylelint. They must pass to commit
the changes.

Some files have flowtype annotations and can be checked for type errors using
Flow by running `yarn test:flow`. See [Flow](https://flow.org/) for more details.

## Pull Requests

 - PR title and description should follow [Angular Commit Message Conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines)
 - link back to the original issue(s) whenever possible
 - new commands should be added to `docs/support_table.md` and `docs/supported.md`
 - commits should be squashed before merging
 - large pull requests should be broken into separate pull requests (or multiple logically cohesive commits), if possible

KaTeX is a fast, easy-to-use JavaScript library for TeX math rendering on the web.

 * **Fast:** KaTeX renders its math synchronously and doesn't need to reflow the page. See how it compares to a competitor in [this speed test](https://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).
 * **Print quality:** KaTeX's layout is based on Donald Knuth's TeX, the gold standard for math typesetting.
 * **Self contained:** KaTeX has no dependencies and can easily be bundled with your website resources.
 * **Server side rendering:** KaTeX produces the same output regardless of browser or environment, so you can pre-render expressions using Node.js and send them as plain HTML.

KaTeX is compatible with all major browsers, including Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, Edge, and IE 11.

KaTeX supports much (but not all) of LaTeX and many LaTeX packages. See the [list of supported functions](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html).

Try out KaTeX [on the demo page](https://katex.org/#demo)!

## Getting started

### Starter template

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- KaTeX requires the use of the HTML5 doctype. Without it, KaTeX may not render properly -->
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.2/dist/katex.min.css" integrity="sha384-bYdxxUwYipFNohQlHt0bjN/LCpueqWz13HufFEV1SUatKs1cm4L6fFgCi1jT643X" crossorigin="anonymous">

    <!-- The loading of KaTeX is deferred to speed up page rendering -->
    <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.2/dist/katex.min.js" integrity="sha384-Qsn9KnoKISj6dI8g7p1HBlNpVx0I8p1SvlwOldgi3IorMle61nQy4zEahWYtljaz" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

    <!-- To automatically render math in text elements, include the auto-render extension: -->
    <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.2/dist/contrib/auto-render.min.js" integrity="sha384-+VBxd3r6XgURycqtZ117nYw44OOcIax56Z4dCRWbxyPt0Koah1uHoK0o4+/RRE05" crossorigin="anonymous"
        onload="renderMathInElement(document.body);"></script>
  </head>
  ...
</html>
```

You can also [download KaTeX](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/releases) and host it yourself.

For details on how to configure auto-render extension, refer to [the documentation](https://katex.org/docs/autorender.html).

### API

Call `katex.render` to render a TeX expression directly into a DOM element.
For example:

```js
katex.render("c = \\pm\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}", element, {
    throwOnError: false
});
```

Call `katex.renderToString` to generate an HTML string of the rendered math,
e.g., for server-side rendering.  For example:

```js
var html = katex.renderToString("c = \\pm\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}", {
    throwOnError: false
});
// '<span class="katex">...</span>'
```

Make sure to include the CSS and font files in both cases.
If you are doing all rendering on the server, there is no need to include the
JavaScript on the client.

The examples above use the `throwOnError: false` option, which renders invalid
inputs as the TeX source code in red (by default), with the error message as
hover text.  For other available options, see the
[API documentation](https://katex.org/docs/api.html),
[options documentation](https://katex.org/docs/options.html), and
[handling errors documentation](https://katex.org/docs/error.html).

## Installation
### npm
Install with `npm`:

```bash
npm install katex
# or globally
npm install -g katex
```

### Yarn
Install with `Yarn`:

```bash
yarn add katex
# or globally
yarn global add katex
```

### Building from Source
To build you will need Git, Node.js 10 or later, and Yarn.

Clone a copy of the GitHub source repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX.git
cd KaTeX
```

Then install dependencies and run `build` script:
```bash
yarn
yarn build
```

It will automatically transpile code and include only necessary fonts for
target environments specified by [Browserslist config](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#environment-variables).
For example, if you are making a web app for a kiosk with Chrome 68, run
`BROWSERSLIST="Chrome 68" yarn build` and it will produce build with no
transpilation, as it fully supports ES6, and only include WOFF2 fonts.

You can override included fonts using environment variables. Set `USE_(FONT NAME)`
environment variable to `"true"` or `"false"`, to force a font type to be included
or excluded, respectively.`

If you'd like to use the built KaTeX in other projects, install the package by
specifying the path:
```bash
yarn add /path/to/KaTeX
# or using npm
npm install /path/to/KaTeX
```

> You can manually download the package and source code from
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/releases).

## Importing
KaTeX is exported as a CommonJS module, which can be imported using `require`:
```js
const katex = require('katex');
```

KaTeX also conditionally exports an ECMAScript module:
```js
import katex from 'katex';
```

> The ES module contains ES6 syntaxes and features, and may need transpiling to
use in old environments.

See the [API](api.html) for available functions in the `katex` module.

## Including in webpages

To render any HTML generated by e.g. `katex.renderToString`, you will
still need to link the CSS file, make the KaTeX font files available to the
client, and use the HTML5 doctype.  See [browser usage](browser.html).
Note, however, that you do not need to include `katex.js` on the client.

## Using mhchem extension

The [mhchem extension](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/tree/main/contrib/mhchem)
adds its features by modifying the `katex` module.  So you can use KaTeX with
mhchem in Node as follows:

```js
const katex = require('katex');
require('katex/contrib/mhchem'); // modify katex module
const html = katex.renderToString('\\ce{CO2 + C -> 2 C0}');
```

```
File: webpack.dev.js
```
// @flow
const {targets, createConfig} = require('./webpack.common');
const path = require('path');
const PORT = 7936;

//                                                             dev   minify
const katexConfig /*: Object*/ = createConfig(targets.shift(), true, false);

// add the entry point for test page
katexConfig.entry.main = './static/main.js';

// only the `devServer` options for the first configuration will be taken
// into account and used for all the configurations in the array.
katexConfig.devServer = {
    static: [
        path.join(__dirname, 'static'),
        {
            directory: __dirname,
            watch: false,
        },
    ],
    // Allow server to be accessed from anywhere, which is useful for
    // testing.  This potentially reveals the source code to the world,
    // but this should not be a concern for testing open-source software.
    allowedHosts: 'all',
    host: '0.0.0.0',
    port: PORT,
};

module.exports = ([
    katexConfig,
    ...targets.map(target => createConfig(target, true, false)),
] /*: Array<Object> */);

```
