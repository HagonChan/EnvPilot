##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

### File:

  staticcheck:
    # SA1019 is for checking that we're not using fields marked as deprecated

    # it's tripping on our own structs.
