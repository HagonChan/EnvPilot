##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to install dependencies and set up a environment that is able to run the tests of the project.

- You start with an initial Docker container based on ubuntu:22.04.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- No need to clone the project again.

The final objective is to successfully run the tests of the project.


### Rust-Specific Instructions:
- Use `cargo build` to build the project
- Use `cargo test` to run tests
- Use `cargo check` for faster compilation checks
- Install system dependencies if needed (check Cargo.toml for sys crates)
- Consider using `cargo install` for binary dependencies


================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

    Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
        <command>bash command</command>
        e.g. install build-essential: <command>apt-get install -y build-essential</command>
        e.g. view file content: <command>cat README.md</command>
    Search: search the web for if you need some information, generate query and reply with following format:
        <search>the search query</search>
        e.g. <search>how to fix 'No module named setuptools'</search>
        e.g. <search>how to install python3 on ubuntu</search>
        e.g. <search>how to create development environment for python3</search>
    Stop: stop the setup loop once you think the setup is complete, reply with following format:
        <stop></stop>
    

Observation will be the result of running those actions.


Project Structure: the structure of the project, including files and directories.
Related Files: the content of related files of the project that may help you understand the project.
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: <command>your bash command here</command> or <search>your search query</search> or other actions available
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) ...
Thought: I think the setup should be fine
Action: <stop>stop the setup</stop>
Answer: the final result

`fish <https://fishshell.com/>`__ - the friendly interactive shell |Build Status| |Cirrus CI|
=============================================================================================

fish is a smart and user-friendly command line shell for macOS, Linux,
and the rest of the family. fish includes features like syntax
highlighting, autosuggest-as-you-type, and fancy tab completions that
just work, with no configuration required.

For downloads, screenshots and more, go to https://fishshell.com/.

Quick Start
-----------

fish generally works like other shells, like bash or zsh. A few
important differences can be found at
https://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html by searching for the
magic phrase “unlike other shells”.

Detailed user documentation is available by running ``help`` within
fish, and also at https://fishshell.com/docs/current/index.html

Getting fish
------------

macOS
~~~~~

fish can be installed:

-  using `Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`__: ``brew install fish``
-  using `MacPorts <https://www.macports.org/>`__:
   ``sudo port install fish``
-  using the `installer from fishshell.com <https://fishshell.com/>`__
-  as a `standalone app from fishshell.com <https://fishshell.com/>`__

Note: The minimum supported macOS version is 10.10 "Yosemite".

Packages for Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Packages for Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, and Red Hat Enterprise
Linux/CentOS are available from the `openSUSE Build
Service <https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=shells%3Afish&package=fish>`__.

Packages for Ubuntu are available from the `fish
PPA <https://launchpad.net/~fish-shell/+archive/ubuntu/release-3>`__,
and can be installed using the following commands:

::

   sudo apt-add-repository ppa:fish-shell/release-3
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install fish

Instructions for other distributions may be found at
`fishshell.com <https://fishshell.com>`__.

Windows
~~~~~~~

-  On Windows 10/11, fish can be installed under the WSL Windows Subsystem
   for Linux with the instructions for the appropriate distribution
   listed above under “Packages for Linux”, or from source with the
   instructions below.
-  Fish can also be installed on all versions of Windows using
   `Cygwin <https://cygwin.com/>`__ (from the **Shells** category).

Building from source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If packages are not available for your platform, GPG-signed tarballs are
available from `fishshell.com <https://fishshell.com/>`__ and
`fish-shell on
GitHub <https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/releases>`__. See the
`Building <#building>`__ section for instructions.

Running fish
------------

Once installed, run ``fish`` from your current shell to try fish out!

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running fish requires:

-  A terminfo database, typically from curses or ncurses (preinstalled on most \*nix systems) - this needs to be the directory tree format, not the "hashed" database.
   If this is unavailable, fish uses an included xterm-256color definition.
-  some common \*nix system utilities (currently ``mktemp``), in
   addition to the basic POSIX utilities (``cat``, ``cut``, ``dirname``,
   ``file``, ``ls``, ``mkdir``, ``mkfifo``, ``rm``, ``sort``, ``tee``, ``tr``,
   ``uname`` and ``sed`` at least, but the full coreutils plus ``find`` and
   ``awk`` is preferred)
-  The gettext library, if compiled with
   translation support

The following optional features also have specific requirements:

-  builtin commands that have the ``--help`` option or print usage
   messages require ``nroff`` or ``mandoc`` for
   display
-  automated completion generation from manual pages requires Python 3.5+
-  the ``fish_config`` web configuration tool requires Python 3.5+ and a web browser
-  system clipboard integration (with the default Ctrl-V and Ctrl-X
   bindings) require either the ``xsel``, ``xclip``,
   ``wl-copy``/``wl-paste`` or ``pbcopy``/``pbpaste`` utilities
-  full completions for ``yarn`` and ``npm`` require the
   ``all-the-package-names`` NPM module
-  ``colorls`` is used, if installed, to add color when running ``ls`` on platforms
   that do not have color support (such as OpenBSD)

Building
--------

.. _dependencies-1:

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compiling fish from a tarball requires:

-  a C++11 compiler (g++ 4.8 or later, or clang 3.3 or later)
-  CMake (version 3.5 or later)
-  PCRE2 (headers and libraries) - optional, this will be downloaded if missing
-  gettext (headers and libraries) - optional, for translation support

Sphinx is also optionally required to build the documentation from a
cloned git repository.

Additionally, running the test suite requires Python 3.5+ and the pexpect package.

Dependencies, git master
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Building from git master currently requires, in addition to the dependencies for a tarball:

-  Rust (version 1.70 or later)
-  CMake (version 3.19 or later)
-  libclang, even if you are compiling with GCC
-  an Internet connection

fish is in the process of being ported to Rust, replacing all C++ code, and as such these dependencies are a bit awkward and in flux.

In general, we would currently not recommend running from git master if you just want to *use* fish.
Given the nature of the port, what is currently there is mostly a slower and buggier version of the last C++-based release.

Building from source (all platforms) - Makefile generator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install into ``/usr/local``, run:

.. code:: bash

   mkdir build; cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   sudo make install

The install directory can be changed using the
``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` parameter for ``cmake``.

Build options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the normal CMake build options (like ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``), fish has some other options available to customize it.

- BUILD_DOCS=ON|OFF - whether to build the documentation. This is automatically set to OFF when Sphinx isn't installed.
- INSTALL_DOCS=ON|OFF - whether to install the docs. This is automatically set to on when BUILD_DOCS is or prebuilt documentation is available (like when building in-tree from a tarball).
- FISH_USE_SYSTEM_PCRE2=ON|OFF - whether to use an installed pcre2. This is normally autodetected.
- MAC_CODESIGN_ID=String|OFF - the codesign ID to use on Mac, or "OFF" to disable codesigning.
- WITH_GETTEXT=ON|OFF - whether to build with gettext support for translations.

Note that fish does *not* support static linking and will attempt to error out if it detects it.

Help, it didn’t build!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Debian or Ubuntu you want these packages:

::

   sudo apt install build-essential cmake libpcre2-dev gettext

On RedHat, CentOS, or Amazon EC2 everything should be preinstalled.

fish is a shell geared towards interactive use. Its features are
focused on user friendliness and discoverability. The language syntax
is simple but incompatible with other shell languages.

####################
Contributing To Fish
####################

This document tells you how you can contribute to fish.

Fish is free and open source software, distributed under the terms of the GPLv2.

Contributions are welcome, and there are many ways to contribute!

Whether you want to change some of the core Rust source, enhance or add a completion script or function,
improve the documentation or translate something, this document will tell you how.

Getting Set Up
==============

Fish is developed on Github, at https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell.

First, you'll need an account there, and you'll need a git clone of fish.
Fork it on Github and then run::

  git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/fish-shell.git

This will create a copy of the fish repository in the directory fish-shell in your current working directory.

Also, for most changes you want to run the tests and so you'd get a setup to compile fish.
For that, you'll require:

-  Rust - when in doubt, try rustup
-  CMake
-  PCRE2 (headers and libraries) - optional, this will be downloaded if missing
-  gettext (headers and libraries) - optional, for translation support
-  Sphinx - optional, to build the documentation

Of course not everything is required always - if you just want to contribute something to the documentation you'll just need Sphinx,
and if the change is very simple and obvious you can just send it in. Use your judgement!

Once you have your changes, open a pull request on https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/pulls.

Guidelines
==========

In short:

- Be conservative in what you need (``C++11``, few dependencies)
- Use automated tools to help you (including ``make test``, ``build_tools/style.fish`` and ``make lint``)

Contributing completions
========================

Completion scripts are the most common contribution to fish, and they are very welcome.

In general, we'll take all well-written completion scripts for a command that is publically available.
This means no private tools or personal scripts, and we do reserve the right to reject for other reasons.

Before you try to contribute them to fish, consider if the authors of the tool you are completing want to maintain the script instead.
Often that makes more sense, specifically because they can add new options to the script immediately once they add them,
and don't have to maintain one completion script for multiple versions. If the authors no longer wish to maintain the script,
they can of course always contact the fish maintainers to hand it over, preferably by opening a PR.
This isn't a requirement - if the authors don't want to maintain it, or you simply don't want to contact them,
you can contribute your script to fish.

Completion scripts should

1. Use as few dependencies as possible - try to use fish's builtins like ``string`` instead of ``grep`` and ``awk``,
   use ``python`` to read json instead of ``jq`` (because it's already a soft dependency for fish's tools)
2. If it uses a common unix tool, use posix-compatible invocations - ideally it would work on GNU/Linux, macOS, the BSDs and other systems
3. Option and argument descriptions should be kept short.
   The shorter the description, the more likely it is that fish can use more columns.
4. Function names should start with ``__fish``, and functions should be kept in the completion file unless they're used elsewhere.
5. Run ``fish_indent`` on your script.
6. Try not to use minor convenience features right after they are available in fish - we do try to keep completion scripts backportable.
   If something has a real impact on the correctness or performance, feel free to use it,
   but if it is just a shortcut, please leave it.

Put your completion script into share/completions/name-of-command.fish. If you have multiple commands, you need multiple files.

If you want to add tests, you probably want to add a littlecheck test. See below for details.

Thought: The network connectivity issues persist with different mirrors. Since we can't install curl or wget via apt, I'll try a different approach by manually downloading the Rust installation script using Python's urllib, which should be available in the base Ubuntu image.

Action: <command>python3 -c "import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlretrieve('https://sh.rustup.rs', 'rustup.sh')" && sh rustup.sh -y</command>
