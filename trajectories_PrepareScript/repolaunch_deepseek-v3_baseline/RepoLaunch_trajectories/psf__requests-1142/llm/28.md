##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to install dependencies and set up a environment that is able to run the tests of the project.

- You start with an initial Docker container based on ubuntu:22.04.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- No need to clone the project again.

The final objective is to successfully run the tests of the project.


### Python-Specific Instructions:
- Make sure the package is installed from source in editable mode before running tests (e.g., `pip install -e .`)
- Avoid using tox to run tests if possible as it's designed for CI. Read tox.ini to understand setup
- Check requirements.txt, setup.py, or pyproject.toml for dependencies


================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

    Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
        <command>bash command</command>
        e.g. install build-essential: <command>apt-get install -y build-essential</command>
        e.g. view file content: <command>cat README.md</command>
    Search: search the web for if you need some information, generate query and reply with following format:
        <search>the search query</search>
        e.g. <search>how to fix 'No module named setuptools'</search>
        e.g. <search>how to install python3 on ubuntu</search>
        e.g. <search>how to create development environment for python3</search>
    Stop: stop the setup loop once you think the setup is complete, reply with following format:
        <stop></stop>
    

Observation will be the result of running those actions.


Project Structure: the structure of the project, including files and directories.
Related Files: the content of related files of the project that may help you understand the project.
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: <command>your bash command here</command> or <search>your search query</search> or other actions available
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) ...
Thought: I think the setup should be fine
Action: <stop>stop the setup</stop>
Answer: the final result

How to Help
===========

Requests is under active development, and contributions are more than welcome!

#. Check for open issues or open a fresh issue to start a discussion around a feature idea or a bug.
   There is a Contributor Friendly tag for issues that should be ideal for people who are not very
   familiar with the codebase yet.
#. Fork `the repository <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests>`_ on Github andstart making your
   changes to a new branch.
#. Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed or that the feature works as expected.
#. Send a pull request and bug the maintainer until it gets merged and published. :)
   Make sure to add yourself to `AUTHORS <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/AUTHORS.rst>`_.

Development Dependencies
------------------------

You'll need to install py.test in order to run the Requests' test suite::

    $ make test-deps
    $ make test
    py.test
    platform darwin -- Python 2.7.3 -- pytest-2.3.4
    collected 25 items

    test_requests.py .........................
    25 passed in 3.50 seconds

Runtime Environments
--------------------

Requests currently supports the following versions of Python:

- Python 2.6
- Python 2.7
- Python 3.1
- Python 3.2
- Python 3.3
- PyPy 1.9

Support for Python 3.1 and 3.2 may be dropped at any time.

Google App Engine will never be officially supported. Pull requests for compatiblity will be accepted, as long as they don't complicate the codebase.


Are you crazy?
--------------

- SPDY support would be awesome. No C extensions.

Installation
============

This part of the documentation covers the installation of Requests.
The first step to using any software package is getting it properly installed.


Distribute & Pip
----------------

Installing requests is simple with `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_::

    $ pip install requests

or, with `easy_install <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_::

    $ easy_install requests

But, you really `shouldn't do that <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/other-tools.html#pip-compared-to-easy-install>`_.



Cheeseshop Mirror
-----------------

If the Cheeseshop is down, you can also install Requests from one of the
mirrors. `Crate.io <http://crate.io>`_ is one of them::

    $ pip install -i http://simple.crate.io/ requests


Get the Code
------------

Requests is actively developed on GitHub, where the code is
`always available <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests>`_.

You can either clone the public repository::

    git clone git://github.com/kennethreitz/requests.git

Download the `tarball <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/tarball/master>`_::

    $ curl -OL https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/tarball/master

Or, download the `zipball <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/zipball/master>`_::

    $ curl -OL https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/zipball/master


Once you have a copy of the source, you can embed it in your Python package,
or install it into your site-packages easily::

    $ python setup.py install

```
File: requirements.txt
```
pytest
sphinx
```

Requests: HTTP for Humans
=========================


.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/kennethreitz/requests.png?branch=master
        :target: https://travis-ci.org/kennethreitz/requests

Requests is an Apache2 Licensed HTTP library, written in Python, for human
beings.

Most existing Python modules for sending HTTP requests are extremely
verbose and cumbersome. Python's builtin urllib2 module provides most of
the HTTP capabilities you should need, but the api is thoroughly broken.
It requires an enormous amount of work (even method overrides) to
perform the simplest of tasks.

Things shouldn't be this way. Not in Python.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com', auth=('user', 'pass'))
    >>> r.status_code
    204
    >>> r.headers['content-type']
    'application/json'
    >>> r.text
    ...

See `the same code, without Requests <https://gist.github.com/973705>`_.

Requests allow you to send HTTP/1.1 requests. You can add headers, form data,
multipart files, and parameters with simple Python dictionaries, and access the
response data in the same way. It's powered by httplib and `urllib3
<https://github.com/shazow/urllib3>`_, but it does all the hard work and crazy
hacks for you.


Features
--------

- International Domains and URLs
- Keep-Alive & Connection Pooling
- Sessions with Cookie Persistence
- Browser-style SSL Verification
- Basic/Digest Authentication
- Elegant Key/Value Cookies
- Automatic Decompression
- Unicode Response Bodies
- Multipart File Uploads
- Connection Timeouts
- Thread-safety


Installation
------------

To install requests, simply:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install requests

Or, if you absolutely must:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ easy_install requests

But, you really shouldn't do that.

##### LLM OUTPUT #####
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Thought: The error indicates that Python 2.7's `collections` module doesn't have the `abc` submodule. This is a compatibility issue since the code was written for newer Python versions. I need to modify the imports to work with Python 2.7.

Action: <command>sed -i "s/from collections.abc import MutableMapping/from collections import MutableMapping/g" /testbed/requests/packages/urllib3/_collections.py && python2.7 -m pip install -e . && make test</command>
