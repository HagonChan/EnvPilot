##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to install dependencies and set up a environment that is able to run the tests of the project.

- You start with an initial Docker container based on ubuntu:22.04.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- No need to clone the project again.

The final objective is to successfully run the tests of the project.


### Rust-Specific Instructions:
- Use `cargo build` to build the project
- Use `cargo test` to run tests
- Use `cargo check` for faster compilation checks
- Install system dependencies if needed (check Cargo.toml for sys crates)
- Consider using `cargo install` for binary dependencies


================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

    Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
        <command>bash command</command>
        e.g. install build-essential: <command>apt-get install -y build-essential</command>
        e.g. view file content: <command>cat README.md</command>
    Search: search the web for if you need some information, generate query and reply with following format:
        <search>the search query</search>
        e.g. <search>how to fix 'No module named setuptools'</search>
        e.g. <search>how to install python3 on ubuntu</search>
        e.g. <search>how to create development environment for python3</search>
    Stop: stop the setup loop once you think the setup is complete, reply with following format:
        <stop></stop>
    

Observation will be the result of running those actions.


Project Structure: the structure of the project, including files and directories.
Related Files: the content of related files of the project that may help you understand the project.
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: <command>your bash command here</command> or <search>your search query</search> or other actions available
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) ...
Thought: I think the setup should be fine
Action: <stop>stop the setup</stop>
Answer: the final result

# First steps with uv

After [installing uv](./installation.md), you can check that uv is available by running the `uv`
command:

```console
$ uv
An extremely fast Python package manager.

Usage: uv [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

...
```

You should see a help menu listing the available commands.

## Next steps

Now that you've confirmed uv is installed, check out an [overview of features](./features.md), learn
how to [get help](./help.md) if you run into any problems, or jump to the
[guides](../guides/index.md) to start using uv.

# This profile is meant to mimic the `release` profile as closely as

# development. That is, the `release` profile is intended for actually
# building the release, where as `profiling` is meant for building `uv`
# for running benchmarks.
#
# The main differences here are to avoid stripping debug information
# and disabling lto. This does result in a mismatch between our release
# configuration and our benchmarking configuration, which is unfortunate.
# But compile times with `lto = true` are completely untenable:
#
#     $ cargo b --profile profiling -p uv
#        Compiling uv-cli v0.0.1 (/home/andrew/astral/uv/crates/uv-cli)
#        Compiling uv v0.2.34 (/home/andrew/astral/uv/crates/uv)
#         Finished `profiling` profile [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 3m 47s
#
# Using `lto = "thin"` brings a massive improvement, but it's still slow:
#
#     $ cargo b --profile profiling -p uv
#        Compiling uv v0.2.34 (/home/andrew/astral/uv/crates/uv)
#         Finished `profiling` profile [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 53.98s
#
# But with `lto = false`:
#
#     $ cargo b --profile profiling -p uv
#        Compiling uv v0.2.34 (/home/andrew/astral/uv/crates/uv)
#         Finished `profiling` profile [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 30.09s
#
# We get more reasonable-ish compile times. At least, it's not enough
# time to get up and get a cup of coffee before it completes.
#
# This setup does risk that we are measuring something in benchmarks
# that we are shipping, but in order to make those two the same, we'd
# either need to make compile times way worse for development, or take
# a hit to binary size and a slight hit to runtime performance in our

  A guide to using uv to create and manage Python projects, including adding dependencies, running
  commands, and building publishable distributions.

# Working on projects

uv supports managing Python projects, which define their dependencies in a `pyproject.toml` file.

## Creating a new project

You can create a new Python project using the `uv init` command:

```console
$ uv init hello-world
$ cd hello-world
```

Alternatively, you can initialize a project in the working directory:

```console
$ mkdir hello-world
$ cd hello-world
$ uv init
```

uv will create the following files:

```text
├── .gitignore
├── .python-version
├── README.md
├── main.py
└── pyproject.toml
```

The `main.py` file contains a simple "Hello world" program. Try it out with `uv run`:

```console
$ uv run main.py
Hello from hello-world!
```

## Project structure

A project consists of a few important parts that work together and allow uv to manage your project.
In addition to the files created by `uv init`, uv will create a virtual environment and `uv.lock`
file in the root of your project the first time you run a project command, i.e., `uv run`,
`uv sync`, or `uv lock`.

A complete listing would look like:

```text
.
├── .venv
│   ├── bin
│   ├── lib
│   └── pyvenv.cfg
├── .python-version
├── README.md
├── main.py
├── pyproject.toml
└── uv.lock
```

### `pyproject.toml`

The `pyproject.toml` contains metadata about your project:

```toml title="pyproject.toml"
[project]
name = "hello-world"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
dependencies = []
```

You'll use this file to specify dependencies, as well as details about the project such as its
description or license. You can edit this file manually, or use commands like `uv add` and
`uv remove` to manage your project from the terminal.

!!! tip

    See the official [`pyproject.toml` guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/)
    for more details on getting started with the `pyproject.toml` format.

You'll also use this file to specify uv [configuration options](../concepts/configuration-files.md)
in a [`[tool.uv]`](../reference/settings.md) section.

### `.python-version`

The `.python-version` file contains the project's default Python version. This file tells uv which
Python version to use when creating the project's virtual environment.

### `.venv`

The `.venv` folder contains your project's virtual environment, a Python environment that is
isolated from the rest of your system. This is where uv will install your project's dependencies.

See the [project environment](../concepts/projects/layout.md#the-project-environment) documentation
for more details.

### `uv.lock`

`uv.lock` is a cross-platform lockfile that contains exact information about your project's
dependencies. Unlike the `pyproject.toml` which is used to specify the broad requirements of your
project, the lockfile contains the exact resolved versions that are installed in the project
environment. This file should be checked into version control, allowing for consistent and
reproducible installations across machines.

`uv.lock` is a human-readable TOML file but is managed by uv and should not be edited manually.

See the [lockfile](../concepts/projects/layout.md#the-lockfile) documentation for more details.

## Managing dependencies

You can add dependencies to your `pyproject.toml` with the `uv add` command. This will also update
the lockfile and project environment:

```console
$ uv add requests
```

You can also specify version constraints or alternative sources:

```console
$ # Specify a version constraint
$ uv add 'requests==2.31.0'

$ # Add a git dependency
$ uv add git+https://github.com/psf/requests
```

If you're migrating from a `requirements.txt` file, you can use `uv add` with the `-r` flag to add
all dependencies from the file:

```console
$ # Add all dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
$ uv add -r requirements.txt -c constraints.txt
```

To remove a package, you can use `uv remove`:

```console
$ uv remove requests
```

To upgrade a package, run `uv lock` with the `--upgrade-package` flag:

```console
$ uv lock --upgrade-package requests
```

The `--upgrade-package` flag will attempt to update the specified package to the latest compatible
version, while keeping the rest of the lockfile intact.

See the documentation on [managing dependencies](../concepts/projects/dependencies.md) for more
details.

## Managing version

The `uv version` command can be used to read your package's version.

To get the version of your package, run `uv version`:

```console
$ uv version
hello-world 0.7.0
```

To get the version without the package name, use the `--short` option:

```console
$ uv version --short
0.7.0
```

To get version information in a JSON format, use the `--output-format json` option:

```console
$ uv version --output-format json
{
    "package_name": "hello-world",
    "version": "0.7.0",
    "commit_info": null
}
```

See the [publishing guide](./package.md#updating-your-version) for details on updating your package
version.

## Running commands

`uv run` can be used to run arbitrary scripts or commands in your project environment.

Prior to every `uv run` invocation, uv will verify that the lockfile is up-to-date with the
`pyproject.toml`, and that the environment is up-to-date with the lockfile, keeping your project
in-sync without the need for manual intervention. `uv run` guarantees that your command is run in a
consistent, locked environment.

For example, to use `flask`:

```console
$ uv add flask
$ uv run -- flask run -p 3000
```

Or, to run a script:

```python title="example.py"
# Require a project dependency
import flask

print("hello world")
```

```console
$ uv run example.py
```

Alternatively, you can use `uv sync` to manually update the environment then activate it before
executing a command:

=== "macOS and Linux"

    ```console
    $ uv sync
    $ source .venv/bin/activate
    $ flask run -p 3000
    $ python example.py
    ```

=== "Windows"

    ```pwsh-session
    PS> uv sync
    PS> .venv\Scripts\activate
    PS> flask run -p 3000
    PS> python example.py
    ```

!!! note

    The virtual environment must be active to run scripts and commands in the project without `uv run`. Virtual environment activation differs per shell and platform.

See the documentation on [running commands and scripts](../concepts/projects/run.md) in projects for
more details.

## Building distributions

`uv build` can be used to build source distributions and binary distributions (wheel) for your
project.

By default, `uv build` will build the project in the current directory, and place the built
artifacts in a `dist/` subdirectory:

```console
$ uv build
$ ls dist/
hello-world-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
hello-world-0.1.0.tar.gz
```

See the documentation on [building projects](../concepts/projects/build.md) for more details.

## Next steps

To learn more about working on projects with uv, see the
[projects concept](../concepts/projects/index.md) page and the
[command reference](../reference/cli.md#uv).

Or, read on to learn how to [build and publish your project to a package index](./package.md).

# Installing uv

## Installation methods

Install uv with our standalone installers or your package manager of choice.

### Standalone installer

uv provides a standalone installer to download and install uv:

=== "macOS and Linux"

    Use `curl` to download the script and execute it with `sh`:

    ```console
    $ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

    If your system doesn't have `curl`, you can use `wget`:

    ```console
    $ wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

    Request a specific version by including it in the URL:

    ```console
    $ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/0.8.4/install.sh | sh
    ```

=== "Windows"

    Use `irm` to download the script and execute it with `iex`:

    ```pwsh-session
    PS> powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```

    Changing the [execution policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.4#powershell-execution-policies) allows running a script from the internet.

    Request a specific version by including it in the URL:

    ```pwsh-session
    PS> powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/0.8.4/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```

!!! tip

    The installation script may be inspected before use:

    === "macOS and Linux"

        ```console
        $ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | less
        ```

    === "Windows"

        ```pwsh-session
        PS> powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | more"
        ```

    Alternatively, the installer or binaries can be downloaded directly from [GitHub](#github-releases).

See the reference documentation on the [installer](../reference/installer.md) for details on
customizing your uv installation.

### PyPI

For convenience, uv is published to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/uv/).

If installing from PyPI, we recommend installing uv into an isolated environment, e.g., with `pipx`:

```console
$ pipx install uv
```

However, `pip` can also be used:

```console
$ pip install uv
```

!!! note

    uv ships with prebuilt distributions (wheels) for many platforms; if a wheel is not available for a given
    platform, uv will be built from source, which requires a Rust toolchain. See the
    [contributing setup guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#setup)
    for details on building uv from source.

### Homebrew

uv is available in the core Homebrew packages.

```console
$ brew install uv
```

### WinGet

uv is available via [WinGet](https://winstall.app/apps/astral-sh.uv).

```console
$ winget install --id=astral-sh.uv  -e
```

### Scoop

uv is available via [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/#/apps?q=uv).

```console
$ scoop install main/uv
```

### Docker

uv provides a Docker image at
[`ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pkgs/container/uv).

See our guide on [using uv in Docker](../guides/integration/docker.md) for more details.

### GitHub Releases

uv release artifacts can be downloaded directly from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases).

Each release page includes binaries for all supported platforms as well as instructions for using
the standalone installer via `github.com` instead of `astral.sh`.

### Cargo

uv is available via Cargo, but must be built from Git rather than [crates.io](https://crates.io) due
to its dependency on unpublished crates.

```console
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/astral-sh/uv uv
```

!!! note

    This method builds uv from source, which requires a compatible Rust toolchain.

## Upgrading uv

When uv is installed via the standalone installer, it can update itself on-demand:

```console
$ uv self update
```

!!! tip

    Updating uv will re-run the installer and can modify your shell profiles. To disable this
    behavior, set `UV_NO_MODIFY_PATH=1`.

When another installation method is used, self-updates are disabled. Use the package manager's
upgrade method instead. For example, with `pip`:

```console
$ pip install --upgrade uv
```

## Shell autocompletion

!!! tip

    You can run `echo $SHELL` to help you determine your shell.

To enable shell autocompletion for uv commands, run one of the following:

=== "Bash"

    ```bash
    echo 'eval "$(uv generate-shell-completion bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

=== "Zsh"

    ```bash
    echo 'eval "$(uv generate-shell-completion zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
    ```

=== "fish"

    ```bash
    echo 'uv generate-shell-completion fish | source' > ~/.config/fish/completions/uv.fish
    ```

=== "Elvish"

    ```bash
    echo 'eval (uv generate-shell-comp

Configuring tzdata
------------------

Please select the geographic area in which you live. Subsequent configuration
questions will narrow this down by presenting a list of cities, representing
the time zones in which they are located.

  1. Africa      4. Australia  7. Atlantic  10. Pacific  13. Legacy
  2. America     5. Arctic     8. Europe    11. US
  3. Antarctica  6. Asia       9. Indian    12. Etc
