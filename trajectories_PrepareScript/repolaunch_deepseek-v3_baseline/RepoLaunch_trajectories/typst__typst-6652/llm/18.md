##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to install dependencies and set up a environment that is able to run the tests of the project.

- You start with an initial Docker container based on ubuntu:22.04.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- No need to clone the project again.

The final objective is to successfully run the tests of the project.


### Rust-Specific Instructions:
- Use `cargo build` to build the project
- Use `cargo test` to run tests
- Use `cargo check` for faster compilation checks
- Install system dependencies if needed (check Cargo.toml for sys crates)
- Consider using `cargo install` for binary dependencies


================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

    Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
        <command>bash command</command>
        e.g. install build-essential: <command>apt-get install -y build-essential</command>
        e.g. view file content: <command>cat README.md</command>
    Search: search the web for if you need some information, generate query and reply with following format:
        <search>the search query</search>
        e.g. <search>how to fix 'No module named setuptools'</search>
        e.g. <search>how to install python3 on ubuntu</search>
        e.g. <search>how to create development environment for python3</search>
    Stop: stop the setup loop once you think the setup is complete, reply with following format:
        <stop></stop>
    

Observation will be the result of running those actions.


Project Structure: the structure of the project, including files and directories.
Related Files: the content of related files of the project that may help you understand the project.
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: <command>your bash command here</command> or <search>your search query</search> or other actions available
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) ...
Thought: I think the setup should be fine
Action: <stop>stop the setup</stop>
Answer: the final result

Typst is a new markup-based typesetting system that is designed to be as powerful
as LaTeX while being much easier to learn and use. Typst has:

- Built-in markup for the most common formatting tasks
- Flexible functions for everything else
- A tightly integrated scripting system
- Math typesetting, bibliography management, and more
- Fast compile times thanks to incremental compilation
- Friendly error messages in case something goes wrong

This repository contains the Typst compiler and its CLI, which is everything you
need to compile Typst documents locally. For the best writing experience,
consider signing up to our [collaborative online editor][app] for free.

## Example
A [gentle introduction][tutorial] to Typst is available in our documentation.
However, if you want to see the power of Typst encapsulated in one image, here
it is:
<p align="center">
 <img alt="Example" width="900" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17899797/228031796-ced0e452-fcee-4ae9-92da-b9287764ff25.png">
</p>


Let's dissect what's going on:

- We use _set rules_ to configure element properties like the size of pages or
  the numbering of headings. By setting the page height to `auto`, it scales to
  fit the content. Set rules accommodate the most common configurations. If you
  need full control, you can also use [show rules][show] to completely redefine
  the appearance of an element.

- We insert a heading with the `= Heading` syntax. One equals sign creates a top
  level heading, two create a subheading and so on. Typst has more lightweight
  markup like this, see the [syntax] reference for a full list.

- [Mathematical equations][math] are enclosed in dollar signs. By adding extra
  spaces around the contents of an equation, we can put it into a separate block.
  Multi-letter identifiers are interpreted as Typst definitions and functions
  unless put into quotes. This way, we don't need backslashes for things like
  `floor` and `sqrt`. And `phi.alt` applies the `alt` modifier to the `phi` to
  select a particular symbol variant.

- Now, we get to some [scripting]. To input code into a Typst document, we can
  write a hash followed by an expression. We define two variables and a
  recursive function to compute the n-th fibonacci number. Then, we display the
  results in a center-aligned table. The table function takes its cells
  row-by-row. Therefore, we first pass the formulas `$F_1$` to `$F_8$` and then
  the computed fibonacci numbers. We apply the spreading operator (`..`) to both
  because they are arrays and we want to pass the arrays' items as individual
  arguments.

<details>
  <summary>Text version of the code example.</summary>

  ```typst
  #set page(width: 10cm, height: auto)
  #set heading(numbering: "1.")

  = Fibonacci sequence
  The Fibonacci sequence is defined through the
  recurrence relation $F_n = F_(n-1) + F_(n-2)$.
  It can also be expressed in _closed form:_

  $ F_n = round(1 / sqrt(5) phi.alt^n), quad
    phi.alt = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2 $

  #let count = 8
  #let nums = range(1, count + 1)
  #let fib(n) = (
    if n <= 2 { 1 }
    else { fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2) }
  )

  The first #count numbers of the sequence are:

  #align(center, table(
    columns: count,
    ..nums.map(n => $F_#n$),
    ..nums.map(n => str(fib(n))),
  ))
  ```
</details>

## Installation
Typst's CLI is available from different sources:

- You can get sources and pre-built binaries for the latest release of Typst
  from the [releases page][releases]. Download the archive for your platform and
  place it in a directory that is in your `PATH`. To stay up to date with future
  releases, you can simply run `typst update`.

- You can install Typst through different package managers. Note that the
  versions in the package managers might lag behind the latest release.
  - Linux:
      - View [Typst on Repology][repology]
      - View [Typst's Snap][snap]
  - macOS: `brew install typst`
  - Windows: `winget install --id Typst.Typst`

- If you have a [Rust][rust] toolchain installed, you can install
  - the latest released Typst version with
    `cargo install --locked typst-cli`
  - a development version with
    `cargo install --git https://github.com/typst/typst --locked typst-cli`

- Nix users can
  - use the `typst` package with `nix-shell -p typst`
  - build and run a development version with
    `nix run github:typst/typst -- --version`.

- Docker users can run a prebuilt image with
  `docker run ghcr.io/typst/typst:latest --help`.

## Usage
Once you have installed Typst, you can use it like this:
```sh
# Creates `file.pdf` in working directory.
typst compile file.typ

# Creates PDF file at the desired path.
typst compile path/to/source.typ path/to/output.pdf
```

You can also watch source files and automatically recompile on changes. This is
faster than compiling from scratch each time because Typst has incremental
compilation.
```sh
# Watches source files and recompiles on changes.
typst watch file.typ
```

Typst further allows you to add custom font paths for your project and list all
of the fonts it discovered:
```sh
# Adds additional directories to search for fonts.
typst compile --font-path path/to/fonts file.typ

# Lists all of the discovered fonts in the system and the given directory.
typst fonts --font-path path/to/fonts

# Or via environment variable (Linux syntax).
TYPST_FONT_PATHS=path/to/fonts typst fonts
```

For other CLI subcommands and options, see below:
```sh
# Prints available subcommands and options.
typst help

# Prints detailed usage of a subcommand.
typst help watch
```

If you prefer an integrated IDE-like experience with autocompletion and instant 
preview, you can also check out our [free web app][app]. Alternatively, there is 
a community-created language server called 
[Tinymist](https://myriad-dreamin.github.io/tinymist/) which is integrated into 
various editor extensions.

## Community
The main places where the community gathers are our [Forum][forum] and our
[Discord server][discord]. The Forum is a great place to ask questions, help
others, and share cool things you created with Typst. The Discord server is more
suitable for quicker questions, discussions about contributing, or just to chat.
We'd be happy to see you there!

[Typst Universe][universe] is where the community shares templates and packages.
If you want to share your own creations, you can submit them to our
[package repository][packages].

If you had a bad experience in our community, please [reach out to us][contact].

## Contributing
We love to see contributions from the community. If you experience bugs, feel
free to open an issue. If you would like to implement a new feature or bug fix,
please follow the steps outlined in the [contribution guide][contributing].

To build Typst yourself, first ensure that you have the
[latest stable Rust][rust] installed. Then, clone this repository and build the
CLI with the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/typst/typst
cd typst
cargo build --release
```

The optimized binary will be stored in `target/release/`.

Another good way to contribute is by [sharing packages][packages] with the
community.

## Pronunciation and Spelling
IPA: /taɪpst/. "Ty" like in **Ty**pesetting and "pst" like in Hi**pst**er. When
writing about Typst, capitalize its name as a proper noun, with a capital "T".

## Design Principles
All of Typst has been designed with three key goals in mind: Power,
simplicity, and performance. We think it's time for a system that matches the
power of LaTeX, is easy to learn and use, all while being fast enough to realize
instant preview. To achieve these goals, we follow three core design principles:

- **Simplicity through Consistency:**
  If you know how to do one thing in Typst, you should be able to transfer that
  knowledge to other things. If there are multiple ways to do the same thing,
  one of them should be at a different level of abstraction than the other. E.g.
  it's okay that `= Introduction` and `#heading[Introduction]` do the same thing
  because the former is just syntax sugar for the latter.

- **Power through Composability:**
  There are two ways to make something flexible: Have a knob for everything or
  have a few knobs that you can combine in many ways. Typst is designed with the
  second way in mind. We provide systems that you can compose in ways we've
  never even thought of. TeX is also in the second category, but it's a bit
  low-level and therefore people use LaTeX instead. But there, we don't really
  have that much composability. Instead, there's a package for everything
  (`\usepackage{knob}`).

- **Performance through Incrementality:**
  All Typst language features must accommodate for incremental compilation.
  Luckily we have [`comemo`], a system for incremental compilation which does
  most of the hard work in the background.

Rust is installed now. Great!

To get started you may need to restart your current shell.
This would reload your PATH environment variable to include
Cargo's bin directory ($HOME/.cargo/bin).

To configure your current shell, you need to source
the corresponding env file under $HOME/.cargo.

This is usually done by running one of the following (note the leading DOT):
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"            # For sh/bash/zsh/ash/dash/pdksh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env.fish"  # For fish
source $"($nu.home-path)/.cargo/env.nu"  # For nushell

exit code: 0

================================== Ai Message ==================================

Thought: Rust has been successfully installed. Now I need to add Cargo's bin directory to the PATH so we can use rustc and cargo commands. Then I'll verify the installation.

Action: <command>source "$HOME/.cargo/env" && rustc --version && cargo --version</command>
================================ Human Message =================================

Observation:
source "$HOME/.cargo/env" && rustc --version && cargo --version
rustc 1.88.0 (6b00bc388 2025-06-23)
cargo 1.88.0 (873a06493 2025-05-10)


root@5ea3b1ed553c:/testbed $

exit code: 0

================================== Ai Message ==================================

Thought: The Rust toolchain is now properly installed and configured. Since this is a Rust project, I should now be able to build and test it using cargo. Let's try running the tests.
