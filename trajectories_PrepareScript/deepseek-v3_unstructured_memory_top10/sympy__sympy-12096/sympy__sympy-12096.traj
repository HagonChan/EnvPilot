          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1.

The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

      "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: '>=3.6'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.py\n  install_command: python setup.py install\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required:\n  - python3-dev\n  - python3-pip\n  - git\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful experience which can help you to configure this repository:\n\n**Experience1**: When package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` are unavailable, the system likely uses a different package manager. Identify the Linux distribution via `cat /etc/os-release` and use the appropriate command (e.g., `apk` for Alpine, `dnf` for Fedora) to install dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements.\n\n**Experience2**: If the required Python version for a project is unclear, causing compatibility issues, check setup.py or pyproject.toml for version constraints. For instance, if setup.py specifies `python_requires='>=3.7'`, Python 3.7 or newer is supported. Resolve by using a compatible version and ensuring dependencies match the version's constraints.\n\n**Experience3**: If dependency installation fails because the pip command is unavailable for a specific Python version, install the general pip package and use the Python interpreter's module mode to run pip. For example, after installing `python3-pip` via `apt-get install -y python3-pip`, run dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience4**: When setting up a project on a Linux system, build or runtime errors may occur if required system dependencies like libfontconfig-dev are missing. To resolve this, update the package index and install the dependency using the package manager, such as running `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig-dev` on Debian-based distributions.\n\n**Experience5**: When a custom test runner (e.g., `runtests.py`) causes import conflicts due to path modifications, bypass it by directly using pytest from the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider` to avoid sys.path issues.\n\n**Experience6**: If running `make` commands results in a 'make: command not found' error, it is because the GNU Make build utility is not installed on the system. The solution is to install it using the package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based Ubuntu system.\n\n**Experience7**: If tests fail due to compatibility issues with an outdated Python version (e.g., Python 3.6), upgrade to a supported version by installing it via the package manager and updating symlinks. For example, run `apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-dev && ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3` to switch to Python 3.9.\n\n**Experience8**: If the test command fails with a 'command not found' error for tools like pytest, it's typically because the required dependencies are not installed in the environment. The solution is to install the dependencies using the project's requirements file by running `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`.\n\n**Experience9**: If the build fails with a 'make: command not found' error during project setup, it typically indicates that the 'make' build utility is not installed in the environment. The solution is to install it using the system package manager, for example, by running `apt-get install -y make` on a Debian-based system.\n\n**Experience10**: When dependency installation fails due to PyYAML build errors on newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), upgrade to a compatible version like PyYAML>=6.0 using `pip install 'PyYAML>=6.0'` before installing other dependencies.\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\",\"instance_template\":\"We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\\n\\n{{repo_related_info}}\\n\\n{{cross_repo_knowledge}}\\n\\nTASK TIPS:\\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them.
