"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed multiple test suites (23 tests in total) with all tests passing. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, and the tests completed successfully without any framework-level failures.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent built the SDL library from source and verified core functionality by running various test programs (e.g., testaudioinfo, testautomation, testatomic, etc.). The successful execution of these tests demonstrates that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally, and basic API calls return expected results.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria:\n- At least one complete test suite executed successfully (in fact, multiple suites ran successfully)\n- Core functionality was verified through test program execution\n- No critical errors occurred during the process (all tests passed)"
