"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully with `make test`, completing all test cases and generating a coverage report of 99.2%. The output shows numerous test cases passing (e.g., `TestBasicAuth`, `TestContextFormFile`, etc.), and the test framework produced a complete report structure.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project's main modules (e.g., `gin`, `binding`, `render`) were imported and tested successfully. The test output confirms core functionality works as expected, with no critical errors during execution. The agent also verified Go module resolution (`go mod tidy`) and environment configuration (Go 1.21.0).\n\nThe environment meets both success criteria: test suite completion and core functionality verification, despite initial dependency resolution issues that were resolved."
