"FAILED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite could not be executed because the required PHP extensions (`curl`, `zip`, and `dom`) could not be installed due to insufficient disk space. The `vendor/bin/codecept` script was missing, and attempts to run tests directly from the `tests` directory were unsuccessful. No test suite could start, execute, or finish successfully.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: Core functionality could not be verified because the project dependencies could not be installed. The `composer install` command failed due to missing PHP extensions, which are required for the project to function properly. As a result, core modules could not be imported or used normally.\n\nThe environment configuration did not meet the success criteria because neither the test suite could be executed nor the core functionality verified due to unresolved dependency and disk space issues."
