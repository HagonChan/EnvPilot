"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed the test suite (`npm test`) which ran 341 Mocha tests, all passing. This meets Condition 1 as the test framework completed execution and generated results.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The successful test execution inherently verifies that core modules can be imported and used normally (Condition 2), as the tests wouldn't pass if fundamental functionality was broken. The agent also demonstrated the ability to install dependencies and configure the environment properly.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful because:\n- The test suite completed execution with a full report\n- Core functionality was verified through test execution\n- All required dependencies were properly installed\n- Node.js/npm were correctly set up\n- The agent followed the proper configuration steps from CI/CD files and package.json"
