"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The PHPUnit test suite successfully started, executed, and completed, running 11,500 tests with 33441 assertions. While there were 5 errors, 3 failures, and 3 risky tests, the test suite did complete its execution and generated a full report. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execution, even with individual test failures.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality appears to be working as demonstrated by:\n   - Successful installation of all required PHP extensions and system dependencies\n   - Successful installation of project dependencies via Composer\n   - Ability to import and execute the test framework (PHPUnit)\n   - Majority of tests (11,489 out of 11,500) executed without critical failures\n\nThe errors and failures encountered appear to be test-specific issues rather than fundamental environment configuration problems. The deprecation notices and test failures don't prevent the core functionality from working, as evidenced by the thousands of tests that did pass successfully.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria: test suite execution completed and core functionality is verified to be operational."
