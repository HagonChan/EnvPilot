"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite (`rake -m test:run:serial`) executed successfully, completing with a full test report. The output shows 1610 tests passed (OK), 0 failed (KO), 0 crashes, and 8 skipped for the `mrbtest` suite, and 100 tests passed for the `bintest` suite. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite finish successfully, even with some skipped tests.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The environment was properly configured with Ruby 3.1.0, `bundler`, and all project dependencies. The test execution demonstrates that core modules (e.g., `mrbtest`, `bintest`) were imported and executed without critical errors, confirming basic functionality. The build process also completed without errors, further validating the environment setup."
