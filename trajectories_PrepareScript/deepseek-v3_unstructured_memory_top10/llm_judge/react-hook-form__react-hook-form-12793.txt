"PASSED\nDetailed reasoning:\n1. Test Suite Execution: The agent successfully ran the test suite using `pnpm test`, which executed Jest tests. The output shows all 98 test suites passed with 1787 tests and 8 snapshots, indicating the test framework completed successfully and generated a complete test report structure.\n\n2. Core Functionality Verification: The agent verified core functionality by:\n   - Installing all required dependencies (Node.js, npm, pnpm)\n   - Successfully building the project\n   - Running the test suite which exercises the core functionality\n   - The tests passing confirms the main functional modules can be imported and used normally\n\nBoth success criteria are met:\n- At least one complete test suite executed and finished successfully (Jest tests)\n- Core functionality was verified through the successful test execution and project build\n\nThe environment configuration is therefore considered successful as it meets both required conditions."
