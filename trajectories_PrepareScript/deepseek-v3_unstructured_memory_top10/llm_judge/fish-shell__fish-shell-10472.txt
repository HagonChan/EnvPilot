"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully with 177 out of 179 tests passing. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, and the suite completed execution despite two test failures (`cd.fish` and `path.fish`). This meets the success criteria as individual test failures are acceptable as long as the suite completes.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project was successfully built using CMake and `make`, and the main functional modules were verified to work normally. The core features were demonstrated through the execution of the test suite, with the majority of tests passing. This confirms that the core functionality is operational.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful because both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) were met. The two test failures do not invalidate the success as they are non-critical errors."
