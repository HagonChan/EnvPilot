"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed multiple test suites including unit tests (`./src/valkey-unit-tests`) and integration tests (`./runtest`). All tests completed successfully with the output showing \"All tests passed without errors\" and detailed test reports for each suite.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project was successfully built from source using both `make` and `cmake` as evidenced by the build output. Core modules were imported and used normally, with the test suites demonstrating basic API functionality and core features through extensive test cases. The successful execution of unit tests and integration tests confirms that the main functional modules are working as expected.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria as the test suites completed execution and core functionality was verified through successful test runs. The agent followed the repository's CI configuration to properly set up the environment and validate the installation."
