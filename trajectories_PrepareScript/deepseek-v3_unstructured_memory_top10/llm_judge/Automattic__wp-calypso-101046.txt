"PASSED\nDetailed Reasoning:\n1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**:\n   - The test suite completed successfully with a comprehensive report structure showing 12 test suites (1 failed, 11 passed) and 325 tests (4 failed, 321 passed). \n   - The test framework generated detailed output including snapshots (24 passed) and execution time metrics (22.003s total).\n   - Individual test failures don't invalidate success as per criteria, as long as the suite completes.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**:\n   - The environment was properly configured with Node.js v22.9.0 and Yarn 4.0.2 as required.\n   - Dependencies were successfully installed via `yarn install`.\n   - The project's main modules were importable and testable, evidenced by the extensive test execution.\n   - Core functionality was demonstrated through the test execution process itself.\n\n3. **Success Criteria Met**:\n   - Both conditions are satisfied: (1) test suite completed with full reporting, and (2) core functionality was verified through test execution.\n   - The 4 test failures appear to be test-specific issues rather than environment configuration problems."
