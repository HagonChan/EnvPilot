"FAILED\n1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**: The test suite failed to execute. The `pnpm test` command encountered a `SyntaxError` due to the unsupported Node.js version (v12.22.9). The `jiti` package, which is a dependency, uses modern JavaScript features (like top-level `await`) that are not available in Node.js v12. This prevented any test suite from starting or completing successfully.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**: Core functionality could not be verified. While dependencies were installed (with warnings), the environment's Node.js version was incompatible with the project's requirements. This made it impossible to import or use core modules normally, as evidenced by the failure during the test preparation phase.\n\nThe environment configuration did not meet either of the success criteria due to fundamental incompatibility between the available Node.js version and the project's requirements. The agent exhausted all reasonable attempts to configure the environment but was ultimately constrained by system limitations."
