"PASSED\n\nDetailed Reasoning:\n1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**:\n   - The PHPUnit test suite executed successfully, running 337 tests with 1094 assertions.\n   - The test framework generated a complete test report showing test counts, assertions, warnings, and skipped tests.\n   - While there were 11 warnings (about deprecated assertions) and 24 skipped tests, these are non-critical issues that don't prevent the test suite from completing.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**:\n   - The project's dependencies were successfully installed via Composer.\n   - PHP and all required extensions were properly installed.\n   - The test execution demonstrates that core modules can be imported and used, as evidenced by the large number of successful assertions.\n   - The test output shows the framework is operational, with only deprecation warnings rather than critical errors.\n\nThe environment meets both success criteria - the test suite completed execution and core functionality is verified, despite some non-critical warnings and skipped tests. The agent successfully configured the environment within the allowed call limit."
