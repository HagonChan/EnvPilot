"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully ran the test suite using the `gotest` target in the Makefile. Multiple test packages were executed, and all test cases passed. The test framework generated coverage reports for each package, indicating that the test suite completed successfully.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent installed Go 1.21.0 (matching the project's CI requirements) and successfully built the project. The core functionality was verified by running the tests, which included importing and testing various packages (`./assets/...`, `./cmd/...`, `./client/...`, `./server/...`, `./pkg/...`). The tests passed, confirming that the core modules can be imported and used normally.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria:\n- At least one complete test suite executed and finished successfully.\n- Core functional modules were imported and tested successfully. \n\nWhile the end-to-end tests (`e2e` target) couldn't be run due to a version conflict with `ginkgo`, this doesn't affect the success criteria as the main test suite completed successfully and core functionality was verified."
