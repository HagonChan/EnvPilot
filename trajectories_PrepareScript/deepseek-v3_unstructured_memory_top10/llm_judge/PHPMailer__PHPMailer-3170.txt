"FAILED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent was unable to successfully execute any test suite. While PHP and some extensions were installed, the critical step of installing Composer (required for dependency management) failed due to network restrictions. Without Composer, the project's dependencies couldn't be installed, making it impossible to run the test suite (PHPUnit) as specified in the repository's configuration.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent couldn't verify core functionality because:\n   - The project's dependencies weren't installed (Composer failure)\n   - No test suite could be executed to verify basic functionality\n   - Core modules couldn't be properly imported/used without dependencies\n\nThe environment configuration process was incomplete due to the inability to install Composer, which is a fundamental requirement for this PHP project. While PHP and some extensions were successfully installed, the critical path to running tests and verifying functionality was blocked.\n\nNote: The agent made reasonable attempts to work around network restrictions (trying both HTTPS and HTTP, manual installer verification), but ultimately couldn't complete the essential Composer installation step."
