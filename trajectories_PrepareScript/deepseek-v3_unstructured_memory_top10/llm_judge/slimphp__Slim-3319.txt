"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The PHPUnit test suite successfully executed with 432 tests run and 6 skipped. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, indicating that the test suite completed successfully (Condition 1 met).\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project's dependencies were successfully installed using Composer, and the core functionality was verified through the execution of the test suite. The main functional modules can be imported and used normally, as evidenced by the successful test execution (Condition 2 met).\n\nThe environment configuration is successful as both conditions are satisfied: the test suite completed execution and the core functionality is operational. Individual test case failures or skips are acceptable as long as the suite completes, which it did."
