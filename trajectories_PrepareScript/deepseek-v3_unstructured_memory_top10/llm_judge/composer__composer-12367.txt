"FAILED\n\nDetailed Reasoning:\n1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**: The agent attempted to run the test suite but encountered multiple issues:\n   - The initial `composer test` command timed out after 300 seconds\n   - Subsequent attempts to run PHPUnit directly failed because the binary wasn't found\n   - While the `simple-phpunit` binary was eventually located, the test suite never successfully executed to completion\n   - No test report was generated, indicating the test framework didn't run properly\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**: While the agent successfully:\n   - Installed system dependencies\n   - Set up PHP 8.1 with required extensions\n   - Installed Composer\n   - Installed project dependencies\n   The core functionality verification was never completed because:\n   - The test suite couldn't be executed to verify basic functionality\n   - No manual verification of core modules was performed\n   - No example code execution was demonstrated\n\nThe environment configuration ultimately failed because neither of the two success criteria were fully met - the test suite couldn't complete execution, and core functionality wasn't verified. The process timed out before these critical validations could be completed."
