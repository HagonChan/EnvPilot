"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed the test suite (`npm run test-unit`) which completed with 62 test suites passing and 1637 tests executed (2 skipped). The Jest test framework generated a complete test report structure, meeting the first success criterion.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent installed all dependencies (`npm ci`), built the project (`npm run build` and `npm run build-www`), and ran the tests successfully. The core functionality was verified through the successful execution of the test suite, meeting the second success criterion.\n\nThe environment configuration was successful as both conditions were met: the test suite completed execution and the core functionality was verified. The minor warnings about deprecated packages and vulnerabilities do not affect the fundamental success of the environment setup."
