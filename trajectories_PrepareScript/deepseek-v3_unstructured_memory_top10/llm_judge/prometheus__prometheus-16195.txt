"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The Go test suite executed successfully, with all tests passing. The output shows `ok` for all test packages, indicating that the test suite completed without errors. This meets the success criteria for test suite execution.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core Go functionality was verified through the successful execution of the test suite. The tests covered various modules, including `tsdb`, `promql`, `scrape`, and others, demonstrating that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally. Basic API calls and core features were tested and confirmed to work as expected.\n\nAlthough the UI tests could not be executed due to Node.js installation issues, the primary focus of the task was on the Go functionality, which was successfully verified. The UI tests are not critical for the core Go functionality, and their absence does not affect the overall success of the environment configuration."
