"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite ran successfully with 973 test suites executed. Out of 7604 tests, only 1 failed (a path mismatch issue in `foundryup.test.ts`), 2 were marked as todo, and 7601 passed. The test framework generated a complete test report structure with snapshots and coverage information. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project's main functional modules were successfully imported and used during the test execution. The extensive test coverage (including unit tests, integration tests, and other test types) demonstrates that core functionality is working as expected. The test output shows that the majority of tests passed, indicating the core features are operational.\n\nThe single test failure is non-critical (a path comparison issue) and doesn't affect the overall functionality of the system. The environment was properly configured with Node.js v20.19.4 and Yarn 4.5.1 as required, and all dependencies were successfully installed despite initial network-related challenges."
