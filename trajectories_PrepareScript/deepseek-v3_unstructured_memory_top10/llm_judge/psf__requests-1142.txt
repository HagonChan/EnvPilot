"PASSED\n1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The test suite executed successfully with all 26 tests passing, as shown by the output \"26 passed in 26.22 seconds\". The pytest framework generated a complete test report structure.\n2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - While not explicitly shown through API calls, the successful test execution implies the core functionality is working since the tests would have failed if basic imports and functionality were broken. The agent also successfully installed all required dependencies including pytest and sphinx.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria:\n- At least one complete test suite executed and finished successfully\n- The core functionality appears to be working as evidenced by the passing test suite\n- The agent properly followed the installation and testing procedures without exceeding call limits or encountering critical failures"
