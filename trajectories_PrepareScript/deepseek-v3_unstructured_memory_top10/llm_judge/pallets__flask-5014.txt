"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed using `pytest` in the `py311` environment. Although some tests were skipped, the majority of the tests (463 passed, 14 skipped) completed successfully, generating a complete test report structure. This meets the success criteria for test suite execution.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality of the Flask application was verified through the successful execution of numerous test cases. Basic API calls and core features were demonstrated to work as expected, confirming that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally. This meets the success criteria for core functionality verification.\n\nThe environment configuration was successful as both conditions were met: the test suite completed execution, and the core functionality was verified. The agent addressed issues such as missing dependencies (`werkzeug` version mismatch) and test case modifications to ensure compatibility, ultimately achieving a fully functional setup."
