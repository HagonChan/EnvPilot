"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed the test suite using `cargo test`. The output shows that all tests passed (127 in alacritty_terminal, 44 in ref.rs, and doc-tests), with no failures or ignored tests. The test framework generated a complete report structure, meeting Condition 1.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project was built successfully with `cargo build --release`, and the tests confirmed that core modules (e.g., alacritty_terminal, config) are functional. The test results demonstrate that basic API calls and features work as expected, satisfying Condition 2.\n\nThe agent followed a systematic approach: installed dependencies (Rust toolchain, system packages), resolved build issues (installing g++), and validated both framework operability and core functionality. All success criteria were met."
