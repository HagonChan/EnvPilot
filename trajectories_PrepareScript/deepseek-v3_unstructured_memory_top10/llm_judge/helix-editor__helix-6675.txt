"FAILED\n1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution) was not met:\n   - No test suite was able to complete execution\n   - All test commands (`cargo test --workspace` and `cargo build --package helix-term`) timed out without producing any test results\n   - No test report structure was generated\n\n2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification) was not met:\n   - The project failed to build within the time constraints\n   - No core modules could be verified as functional since the build process didn't complete\n   - No API calls or example code could be executed\n\nThe environment configuration process encountered several critical issues:\n- Could not install required tree-sitter-cli due to Rust version incompatibility\n- Build and test commands consistently timed out\n- Unable to verify any core functionality due to incomplete builds\n- No successful test execution was achieved\n\nWhile the basic Rust toolchain and system dependencies were installed, the project itself could not be built or tested successfully within the given constraints."
