"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: Although the project does not have any defined tests in the `meson.build` configuration, the build and installation process completed successfully. The absence of tests does not indicate a failure, as the project may not include a test suite. The build process itself can be considered a form of validation since it compiles all source files without errors.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The `mpv` binary was successfully installed and verified to be functional by checking its version. The output confirms that the binary is correctly linked with the required dependencies (libplacebo, FFmpeg libraries), and the version matches the project's requirements. This satisfies the core functionality verification criterion.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful because the project was built and installed without errors, and the main executable is operational. The lack of a test suite does not invalidate the success, as the primary goal was to configure the environment and ensure the project's core functionality works, which has been achieved."
