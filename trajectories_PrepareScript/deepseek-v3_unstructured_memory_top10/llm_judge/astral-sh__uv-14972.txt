"FAILED\n1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**: The agent was unable to successfully execute any complete test suite. While it installed `pytest` and attempted to run tests, the tests either failed due to missing dependencies (like `built_by_uv`) or did not find any test functions to execute. The Rust-based tests could not be run due to the failure to install Rust and `cargo-nextest`.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**: The agent did not verify that the main functional modules could be imported and used normally. The project's core functionality, which likely depends on Rust components, could not be tested due to the Rust installation issues. The Python-specific dependencies were installed, but without the Rust components, the core functionality remains untested.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning:\n- **Network and Disk Issues**: Persistent network issues prevented the installation of Rust and related tools, which are critical for building and testing the project. Disk space constraints further exacerbated the problem.\n- **Partial Success**: The Python environment was set up correctly, and some Python dependencies were installed, but this was insufficient to meet the success criteria.\n- **Missing Rust Components**: The project's reliance on Rust means that without Rust, neither the test suites nor the core functionality could be properly verified.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe environment configuration did not meet the success criteria because:\n- No complete test suite was executed successfully.\n- Core functionality could not be verified due to missing Rust components. \n\nThe agent made a good effort but was ultimately hindered by external constraints (network and disk space)."
