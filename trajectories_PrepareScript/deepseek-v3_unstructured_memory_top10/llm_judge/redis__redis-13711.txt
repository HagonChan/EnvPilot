"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed both the main test suite (`./runtest`) and the module API tests (`./runtest-moduleapi`). Both test suites completed successfully with the output showing \"All tests passed without errors\" and generating detailed test reports with execution times for each test unit. This satisfies Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project was successfully built from source using `make` with the specified flags, and the test execution confirms that the core functionality is working as expected. The tests cover various aspects of the system including basic operations, modules, and advanced features, demonstrating that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally. This satisfies Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria as the test suites completed successfully and core functionality was verified through the test execution. The agent followed the proper steps to install dependencies, build the project, and run the tests as specified in the CI configuration."
