"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully with all 57 test suites passing and 488 tests completed. The testing framework (Jest) generated a complete test report structure, confirming that the test suite ran to completion without any framework-level errors.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project's main functional modules were successfully imported and used, as evidenced by the successful execution of all test cases. The core features were demonstrated through the test execution, and the project built successfully before running the tests.\n3. **Environment Configuration**: The agent successfully configured the environment by installing the correct Node.js version (v18.20.8) and Yarn (v1.22.22), resolving dependency conflicts, and installing all required project dependencies. The setup matches the requirements specified in the repository's CI/CD configuration.\n4. **Success Criteria Met**: Both conditions for success were fully satisfied - the test suite completed execution and core functionality was verified through passing tests. The agent achieved this without exceeding maximum call limits or encountering critical failures."
