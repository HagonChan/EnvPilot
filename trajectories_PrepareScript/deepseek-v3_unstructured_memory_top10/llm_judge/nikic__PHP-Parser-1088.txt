"FAILED\n1. Test Suite Execution: The test suite could not be executed successfully. The agent encountered multiple issues during the environment setup, including disk space limitations, missing PHP extensions, and dependency installation failures. Although PHP 7.4 and some extensions were eventually installed, the test suite was never executed due to unresolved dependency issues (missing `phpunit` binary in `vendor/bin`).\n\n2. Core Functionality Verification: The core functionality could not be verified. The agent was unable to complete the dependency installation process (via Composer) due to persistent disk space issues and missing PHP extensions (`ext-dom`, `ext-mbstring`). Without successful dependency installation, the project's core modules could not be imported or tested.\n\nThe environment configuration did not meet either of the success criteria due to unresolved technical barriers that prevented both test execution and core functionality verification."
