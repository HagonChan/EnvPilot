"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite (`npm test`) executed successfully, completing with 3,534 passing tests and 48 pending tests. The testing framework (Mocha) generated a complete test report structure, meeting Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project's core functionality was verified through the successful execution of the test suite, which includes tests for various modules and features. The MongoDB binaries were downloaded and used during testing, and the project's dependencies were correctly installed, meeting Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful as both conditions are satisfied: the test suite completed execution, and the core functionality was verified. Individual test failures (if any) were not critical, and the overall setup allows the project to function as intended."
