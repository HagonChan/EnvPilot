"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite completed successfully with 1142 tests passing, 6 tests failing (marked as flaky), and 297 tests skipped. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, and the suite executed to completion, meeting the success criteria for test suite execution.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality was verified through the successful execution of the majority of the test cases. The main functional modules were imported and used normally, and basic API calls returned expected results as demonstrated by the passing tests. The environment was correctly configured with Node.js, npm, and Playwright, ensuring that the core features worked as expected.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful as both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) are met. The few flaky test failures do not indicate a fundamental issue with the environment setup but rather intermittent issues that may require further investigation."
