"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed using `pytest`. Although there were some test failures (85 failed, 3178 passed, 4291 skipped), the test framework completed its run and generated a comprehensive report. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria, which allows for individual test failures as long as the suite completes.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules of the project were successfully imported and used. The agent demonstrated that core features could be executed, including installing dependencies, setting up a virtual environment, and running tests. This meets Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe failures observed are likely due to compatibility issues with specific dependency versions (e.g., `numpy` and `pandas`), but these do not prevent the environment from being considered successfully configured according to the given criteria. The agent followed a systematic approach to resolve dependency conflicts and achieved the primary goals of environment setup and test execution."
