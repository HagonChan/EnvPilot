"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed the test suite for the `shenyu-admin` module. Although there was initially a test failure due to a SQL syntax error, the agent identified and fixed the issue by modifying the SQL query in the `proxy-selector-sqlmap.xml` file. After the fix, all tests passed with only one skipped test, and the test framework generated complete test reports.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent verified that the core functionality of the project works by successfully building the project from source and executing the main build command (`./mvnw -B clean install`). The build process completed without errors, indicating that the core modules can be imported and used normally.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria: the test suite executed successfully, and the core functionality was verified. The agent addressed the encountered issues (missing JDK, Maven Wrapper setup, and test failures) effectively to achieve a successful configuration."
