"FAILED\n1. Condition 1 (Test Suite Execution): The test suite did not complete successfully. The agent encountered multiple issues with `setuptools` version conflicts and deprecated modules (`setuptools.dep_util`). While the agent made several attempts to resolve these issues by downgrading `setuptools` and modifying the `tox.ini` file, the tests ultimately failed to run due to these compatibility problems.\n\n2. Condition 2 (Core Functionality Verification): The core functionality could not be verified because the project could not be installed in development mode (`pip install -e .`) due to the same `setuptools` issues. Attempts to run tests directly with `pytest` also failed because the project was not properly installed.\n\nThe environment configuration was not successful because neither the test suite could complete execution nor could the core functionality be verified. The main obstacles were compatibility issues with newer versions of `setuptools` and the project's reliance on deprecated functionality."
