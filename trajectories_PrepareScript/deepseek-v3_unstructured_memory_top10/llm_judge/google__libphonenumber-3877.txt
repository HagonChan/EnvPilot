"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed multiple test suites:\n   - Java tests via Maven (`mvn test`) and Ant (`ant junit`) completed successfully with all tests passing.\n   - C++ tests (`generate_geocoding_data_test` and `libphonenumber_test`) completed successfully with all 326 tests passing across 16 test suites.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**:\n   - Java components were built successfully (`mvn install`, `ant jar`) and core modules were verified through test execution.\n   - C++ components were built successfully (`cmake`, `make`) and core functionality was verified through test execution.\n   - The agent demonstrated the ability to import and use main functional modules through the test executions.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria as:\n- At least one complete test suite executed successfully for both Java and C++ components\n- Core functionality was verified through test execution and build processes\n- All required dependencies were properly installed and configured\n- The agent successfully navigated and resolved all encountered issues during the setup process"
