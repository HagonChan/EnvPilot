"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The build process completed successfully, and the tests passed without errors. The output confirms that the OpenBLAS library has been built with support for BLAS, CBLAS, LAPACK, and LAPACKE. The test suite executed and generated a complete test report, as evidenced by the detailed test results in the output.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The library was successfully installed to `/usr/local`, including headers, static and shared libraries, and configuration files for `pkg-config` and CMake. The verification step confirmed the presence of the library files (`libopenblas_skylakexp-r0.3.27.dev.a` and `libopenblas_skylakexp-r0.3.27.dev.so`) in `/usr/local/lib`, indicating that the core functionality is available and can be used normally.\n\nBoth conditions for success are met: the test suite executed successfully, and the core functionality is verified to be working."
