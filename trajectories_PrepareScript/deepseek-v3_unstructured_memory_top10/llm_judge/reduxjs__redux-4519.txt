"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite successfully executed with all 82 tests passing when run with the `--no-threads` flag. The Vitest framework generated a complete test report showing all tests passed, meeting the success criteria for test execution.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project was successfully built using `yarn build`, and core modules were verified to be importable and functional through the test execution. The test suite covers core functionality like store creation, reducers, middleware, and utilities, confirming the main functional modules work as expected.\n\nThe environment configuration was successful as both critical criteria were met: the test suite completed execution (despite needing thread limitation) and core functionality was verified through the passing tests. The memory-related issues were environmental constraints rather than configuration problems, and the workaround using `--no-threads` allowed full test execution without modifying test cases."
