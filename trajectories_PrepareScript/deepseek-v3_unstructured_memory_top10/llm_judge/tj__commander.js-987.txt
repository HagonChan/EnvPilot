"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully with all tests passing (`npm test`). The output shows a complete test report structure with numerous test cases marked as passed (âœ“). The test script (`node test/run.js && npm run test-typings`) completed without errors.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules can be imported and used normally, as evidenced by the successful test execution. The tests cover core functionality like command parsing, options handling, and subcommand execution, demonstrating that the basic API calls return expected results. The project's main file (`index.js`) was also successfully loaded during testing.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria:\n- The test suite completed execution with a full report\n- Core functionality was verified through the passing tests\nThe presence of npm audit warnings does not affect the fundamental operability of the project."
