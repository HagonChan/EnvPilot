"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The PHPUnit test suite executed successfully, completing 3428 tests with 3950 assertions. While there were 1087 skipped tests and 2 incomplete tests, this is acceptable as the test suite completed its execution and generated a complete test report structure. The presence of skipped/incomplete tests doesn't indicate a configuration failure.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The environment was properly configured with:\n   - PHP 8.3 installed and set as the default version\n   - All required PHP extensions (simplexml, intl, mbstring) installed\n   - Composer dependencies successfully installed\n   - The test suite was able to run, indicating core functionality is operational\n\nThe agent successfully navigated through multiple configuration challenges (PHP version requirements, missing extensions) and ultimately achieved both success criteria:\n- A complete test suite execution\n- Verified core functionality through test execution and dependency resolution\n\nThe skipped/incomplete tests are considered non-critical as they don't prevent the test framework from completing its execution or indicate fundamental environment configuration issues."
