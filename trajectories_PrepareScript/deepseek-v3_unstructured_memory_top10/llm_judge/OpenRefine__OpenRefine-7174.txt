"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed the Maven test suite (`mvn test`), which completed without errors. The test report structure was generated, and all modules reported successful test execution. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent verified core functionality by:\n   - Building the project successfully (`mvn clean install`)\n   - Running tests across all modules (core, GREL, main, extensions, etc.)\n   - Confirming tool versions (Java 17, Maven 3.6.3, Node.js 18) matched requirements\n   - The build and test process demonstrated that core modules could be imported and used normally, meeting Condition 2.\n\nThe agent overcame installation challenges (Node.js version conflict, missing `genisoimage`) and followed a systematic approach by:\n   - Checking CI/CD files first\n   - Installing correct dependencies\n   - Skipping non-critical failures (packaging module)\n   - Validating toolchain functionality\n   - Executing both build and test phases successfully"
