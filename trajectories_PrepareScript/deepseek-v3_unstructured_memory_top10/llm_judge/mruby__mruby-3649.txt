"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite completed successfully with all tests passing (959 tests in total, plus 16 additional tests). The test framework generated a complete report showing no failures or crashes, meeting the success criteria for test execution.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project was successfully built, and the main functional modules were compiled and tested. The core functionality was verified through the test execution, demonstrating that the environment was correctly configured and the project's features are operational.\n\nThe environment configuration was successful as both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) were met. The agent resolved compatibility issues with Ruby 3.0 by updating the `Rakefile` syntax, installed necessary dependencies, and executed the build and test commands as specified in the project's documentation and CI configurations."
