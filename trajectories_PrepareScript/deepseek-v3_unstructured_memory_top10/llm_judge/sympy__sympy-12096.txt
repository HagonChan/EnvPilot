"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed after resolving several Python 3.10 compatibility issues. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, and while there were some individual test failures initially, the suite completed successfully after the necessary fixes were applied.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules of the SymPy repository were imported and used normally. Basic API calls returned expected results, and core features were demonstrated through example code execution. The project was successfully installed from source, and the test suite confirmed the core functionality.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria:\n- The test suite completed execution, generating a full report.\n- Core modules were importable and functional, with basic API calls working as expected."
