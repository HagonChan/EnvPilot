"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed both unit tests (`go test ./... -short -cover`) and integration tests (`go test ./...`). The test suites completed with output showing test results and coverage percentages, meeting the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute successfully.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent verified core functionality by:\n   - Installing and configuring the correct Go version (1.22.1)\n   - Installing all required system dependencies\n   - Configuring Git properly (setting user.email and user.name)\n   - Successfully running the test suites\n   - The tests demonstrated that core modules could be imported and basic functionality worked, as evidenced by the test execution and coverage reports.\n\nThe initial test failures were due to environment configuration issues (Git not being properly configured), which the agent identified and resolved. After fixing these issues, all tests passed, confirming the environment was correctly configured."
