"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed using `pytest` in the Python 3.7 virtual environment. Although there were 23 failures, the test suite completed and generated a comprehensive test report (2274 passed, 97 skipped, 11 xfailed). This meets the success criteria as the suite completed execution and produced a report structure, despite individual test failures.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality of the project was verified by successfully installing the project dependencies and running the test suite. The main functional modules were imported and used normally, as evidenced by the majority of tests passing. Basic API calls and core features were demonstrated through the test execution.\n\nThe environment configuration was successful because:\n- The test suite completed execution (Condition 1)\n- Core modules were functional and testable (Condition 2)\n- The agent resolved multiple dependency and compatibility issues to achieve a working environment\n- All actions were within the task constraints (no test modifications, no direct package installs)"
