"PASSED\n1. Test Suite Execution: The test suite executed successfully with all test cases passing. The output shows multiple test suites running (unit tests, integration tests, and doc-tests) with results like \"test result: ok\" and \"passed; 0 failed\". The testing framework generated complete test reports for each suite.\n2. Core Functionality Verification: The project built successfully with `cargo build` and core functionality was verified through the test execution. The main functional modules were imported and used normally, as evidenced by the successful test runs including doc-tests and example tests. The core features were demonstrated through the test execution.\n\nBoth success criteria are fully met - the test suite completed successfully and core functionality was verified through test execution and example runs. The environment is properly configured."
