"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite successfully started and completed execution, running 5805 tests with PHPUnit. While there were 2 errors and 4 failures, the test framework generated a complete report structure, meeting the success criteria for test suite execution.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality was verified through the successful installation of all required dependencies (PHP, Composer, system packages, and PHP extensions) and the ability to run the test suite. The test execution demonstrates that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally, even though some edge cases failed.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria despite the test failures, as the failures appear to be related to specific test cases rather than fundamental environment setup issues. The test suite completed execution and core functionality was verified."
