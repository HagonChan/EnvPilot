"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite (`pest`) was successfully executed, completing all 541 tests with 2460 assertions. Although there was initially a failure due to a missing GD extension, this was resolved by installing the `php8.2-gd` package, after which all tests passed.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality was verified through the successful execution of the test suite, which includes tests for various modules like actions, forms, tables, and more. The test results confirm that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally, and basic API calls return expected results.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria:\n- The test suite completed execution successfully.\n- Core functionality was verified through the test results. \n\nThe agent successfully resolved all dependencies, installed necessary PHP extensions, and ensured compatibility with PHP 8.2, leading to a fully functional environment."
