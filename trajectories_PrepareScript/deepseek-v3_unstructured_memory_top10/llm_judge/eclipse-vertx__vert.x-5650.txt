"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The Maven test suite executed successfully, completing with a test report showing 6007 tests run, with 2 failures and 2 errors. The test framework generated a complete report structure, meeting the success criteria despite some individual test failures.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The build process completed successfully, and core modules were able to be imported and used, as evidenced by the majority of tests passing. The test output shows normal execution of test cases and proper logging functionality.\n\nThe environment configuration was successful because:\n- The Java environment was properly configured with JDK 11\n- Maven was correctly installed and executed the build\n- The test suite completed execution with a comprehensive report\n- Core functionality was demonstrated through thousands of passing tests\n- The few test failures appear to be environment-specific (network-related) rather than configuration issues"
