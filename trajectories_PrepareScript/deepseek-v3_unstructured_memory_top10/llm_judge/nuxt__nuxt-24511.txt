"FAILED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite failed to execute successfully. The main issue was the inability to resolve the `@nuxt/kit` module, which prevented the test command (`pnpm test`) from running. Despite multiple attempts to install dependencies, rebuild the workspace, and explicitly install `@nuxt/kit`, the module resolution error persisted. The test suite did not complete execution, and no test report was generated.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: While the core modules were installed and the environment was set up correctly (Node.js, pnpm, Playwright dependencies), the inability to resolve `@nuxt/kit` suggests that the core functionality of the project could not be verified. The main functional modules could not be imported or used normally due to this unresolved dependency.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning:\n- **Dependency Resolution**: The project's dependency resolution failed specifically for `@nuxt/kit`, which is a critical module for the test suite. This indicates a potential misconfiguration in the workspace or a missing build step for local packages.\n- **Environment Setup**: The environment was correctly configured with Node.js 20.x, pnpm, and Playwright dependencies. However, the unresolved `@nuxt/kit` module prevented the project from functioning as expected.\n- **Test Execution**: The test suite could not start due to the missing module, and no test cases were executed. This is a critical failure as per the success criteria.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe environment configuration did not meet the success criteria because the test suite could not execute, and core functionality could not be verified due to the unresolved `@nuxt/kit` module. Further investigation or consultation with the project's maintainers is needed to resolve this issue."
