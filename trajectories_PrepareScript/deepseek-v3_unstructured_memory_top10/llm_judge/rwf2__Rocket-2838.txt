"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully with all tests passing. The output shows multiple test suites running (unit tests, doc-tests) across different modules (core, contrib, etc.), and all tests completed without failures. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, confirming that the test suite executed as expected.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project built successfully (`cargo build` completed without errors), and core modules were imported and used normally during the test execution. The successful test runs demonstrate that basic API calls and core features are functioning as expected. The warnings about unused variables and traits are non-critical and do not affect core functionality.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria: test suite execution completed successfully, and core functionality was verified through test execution. The agent successfully installed dependencies, set up the Rust toolchain, built the project, and ran all tests without critical failures."
