"PASSED\nDetailed Reasoning:\n1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**:\n   - The test suite successfully executed with all 322 test suites passing and 9733 tests (including 25 skipped) completing without failures. The Jest testing framework generated a complete test report structure, including snapshots and timing information.\n   - Even though there were initially 2 test failures, they were resolved upon re-running the test suite, indicating they were likely transient issues rather than environment configuration problems.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**:\n   - The main functional modules (React, ReactDOM, etc.) were successfully imported and used during test execution.\n   - Core features were demonstrated through the execution of thousands of test cases across the entire test suite.\n   - The environment was properly configured with Node.js v18.20.1, Yarn, and all necessary system dependencies (libssl-dev, Playwright dependencies).\n\nThe environment meets both success criteria:\n- At least one complete test suite executed successfully (in fact, all test suites passed)\n- Core functionality was verified through extensive test execution\n- The agent successfully installed all required dependencies and configured the environment properly\n\nNote: The initial test failures were investigated and resolved, and the final test run showed all tests passing, which satisfies the success criteria even if some individual tests had initially failed. The key requirement is that the test framework completes execution and core functionality works, which was achieved."
