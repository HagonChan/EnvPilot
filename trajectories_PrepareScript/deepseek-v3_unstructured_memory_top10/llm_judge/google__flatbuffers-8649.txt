"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite `./flattests` executed successfully and completed with the output \"ALL TESTS PASSED\". This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project was successfully built using CMake and make, indicating that the core functional modules can be compiled and are likely functional. The successful execution of the test suite further confirms that the core functionality is working as expected.\n\nThe environment configuration was successful as both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) were met. The agent successfully installed the necessary dependencies, configured the build environment, built the project, and ran the tests without any critical failures."
