The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1.

Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Documentation\n77:\n78:For user manual, system design and architecture, please refer to [TDengine Documentation](https://docs.tdengine.com) ([TDengine \u6587\u6863](https://docs.taosdata.com))\n79:\n80:You can choose to install TDengine via [container](https://docs.tdengine.com/get-started/deploy-in-docker/), [installation package](https://docs.tdengine.com/get-started/deploy-from-package/), [Kubernetes](https://docs.tdengine.com/operations-and-maintenance/deploy-your-cluster/#kubernetes-deployment) or try [fully managed service](https://cloud.tdengine.com/) without installation. This quick guide is for developers who want to contribute, build, release and test TDengine by themselves. \n81:\n82:For contributing/building/testing TDengine Connectors, please check the following repositories: [JDBC Connector](https://github.com/taosdata/taos-connector-jdbc), [Go Connector](https://github.com/taosdata/driver-go), [Python Connector](https://github.com/taosdata/taos-connector-python), [Node.js Connector](https://github.com/taosdata/taos-connector-node), [C# Connector](https://github.com/taosdata/taos-connector-dotnet), [Rust Connector](https://github.com/taosdata/taos-connector-rust).\n83:\n84:# 3. Prerequisites\n85:\n86:At the moment, TDengine server supports running on Linux/MacOS systems. Any application can also choose the RESTful interface provided by taosAdapter to connect the taosd service. TDengine supports X64/ARM64 CPU, and it will support MIPS64, Alpha64, ARM32, RISC-V and other CPU architectures in the future. Right now we don't support build with cross-compiling environment.\n87:\n88:Starting from version 3.1.0.0, TDengine supports the Windows system exclusively in its TSDB-Enterprise edition.\n89:\n90:If you want to compile taosAdapter or taosKeeper, you need to install Go 1.23 or above.\n91:\n92:## 3.1 Prerequisites on Linux\n93:\n94:<details>\n95:\n96:<summary>Install required tools on Linux</summary>\n97:\n98:### For Ubuntu 18.04\u300120.04\u300122.04\n99:\n100:```bash\n(253 more lines below)\n\n(Open file: /testbed/README.md)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own.

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Run `./build.sh install` to install the binaries.\n\n### Test Steps\nThe `README.md` does not explicitly mention test commands, but the CI/CD workflows suggest that tests are run after the build process.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. Install the required dependencies on Ubuntu.\n2. Build the project using the provided `build.sh` script.\n3. Explore the `tests` directory or CI/CD workflows to identify the test commands.\n\nLet's start by installing the dependencies listed in the `README.md`.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- cmake\n- make\nlanguage:\n  name: C/C++\n  version_constraint: null\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: null\n  name: null\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - cmake\n  - build-essential\n  - git\n  - libjansson-dev\n  - libsnappy-dev\n  - liblzma-dev\n  - zlib1g-dev\n  - pkg-config\n  - libatomic-static\n  - libstdc++-static\n  - argp-standalone\n  - gflags\n  - pkgconfig\n  - gawk\n  - libgeos-dev\n  - libssl-dev\n  - jansson\n  - openssl\n  - snappy\n  - zlib\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Missing essential build tools (gcc, make) required for compiling the project from source\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential packages in the Ubuntu environment, preventing compilation. The solution involved installing these dependencies via apt after resolving proxy configuration issues.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Basic C development libraries (crti.o) were missing, causing linker failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete build tooling. Installing build-base, a meta-package for essential development tools, provided the missing libraries and resolved compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add build-base\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The C compiler (gcc) was missing in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: Compiling the C-based project requires gcc. The root cause was the absence of essential development tools in the environment configuration. Installing gcc enabled successful compilation of the project components.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gcc\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: The libgcc_s.so.1 shared library was missing, causing cargo execution failures.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing runtime dependency for the Rust toolchain. Installing the libgcc package provided the required shared library.\n    - Action: apk add libgcc\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools and dependencies were missing, causing project build and test failures.\n    - Solution: The rollup build tool and vitest test runner were not installed globally, leading to 'command not found' errors during build and test execution. The root cause was incomplete environment tooling. The solution was to install these packages globally after configuring the pnpm environment.\n    - Action: pnpm install -g rollup vitest\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\",\"instance_template\":\"We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\\n\\n{{repo_related_info}}\\n\\n{{cross_repo_knowledge}}\\n\\nTASK TIPS:\\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.\",\"next_step_template\":\"{{observation}}\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"next_step_no_output_template\":\"Your command ran successfully and did not produce any output.\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"strategy_template\":null,\"demonstration_template\":null,\"success_reflection_template\":\"You are an expert code assistant who just successfully repaired a software project in an automated programming session.

If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\\n  signature: search_dir <search_term> [<dir>]\\n  arguments:\\n    - search_term (string) [required]: the term to search for\\n    - dir (string) [optional]: the directory to search in (if not provided, searches in the current directory)\\n\\nsearch_file:\\n  docstring: searches for search_term in file. If file is not provided, searches in the current open file\\n  signature: search_file <search_term> [<file>]\\n  arguments:\\n    - search_term (string) [required]: the term to search for\\n    - file (string) [optional]: the file to search in (if not provided, searches in the current open file)\\n\\nedit:\\n  docstring: Replace first occurrence of <search> with <replace> in the currently displayed lines. If replace-all is True , replace all occurrences of <search> with <replace>.\\nFor example, if you are looking at this file:\\ndef fct():\\n    print(\\\"Hello world\\\")\\n\\nand you want to edit the file to read:\\ndef fct():\\n    print(\\\"Hello\\\")\\n    print(\\\"world\\\")\\n\\nyou can search for `Hello world` and replace with `\\\"Hello\\\"\\\\n    print(\\\"world\\\")` (note the extra spaces before the print statement!).\\nTips:\\n1. Always include proper whitespace/indentation 2. When you are adding an if/with/try statement, you need to INDENT the block that follows, so make sure to include it in both your search and replace strings! 3. If you are wrapping code in a try statement, make sure to also add an 'except' or 'finally' block.\\nBefore every edit, please\\n1. Explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing the problem 2. Explain the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem 3. Explain how the edit does not break existing functionality\\n\\n  signature: edit <search> <replace> [<replace-all>]\\n\\n  arguments:\\n    - search (string) [required]: the text to search for (make sure to include proper whitespace if needed)\\n    - replace (string) [required]: the text to replace the search with (make sure to include proper whitespace if needed)\\n    - replace-all (boolean) [optional]: replace all occurrences rather than the first occurrence within the displayed lines\\n\\ninsert:\\n  docstring: Insert <text> at the end of the currently opened file or after <line> if specified.\\n\\n  signature: insert <text> [<line>]\\n\\n  arguments:\\n    - text (string) [required]: the text to insert\\n    - line (integer) [optional]: the line number to insert the text as new lines after\\n\\nsubmit:\\n  docstring: submits the current file\\n  signature: submit\\n\\n\",\"multi_line_command_endings\":{},\"submit_command_end_name\":null,\"reset_commands\":[],\"execution_timeout\":32400,\"install_timeout\":3600},\"history_processors\":[{\"n\":5,\"always_remove_output_for_tags\":[\"remove_output\"],\"always_keep_output_for_tags\":[\"keep_output\"],\"type\":\"last_n_observations\"}],\"model\":{\"name\":\"openai/deepseek-v3-250324\",\"per_instance_cost_limit\":3.0,\"total_cost_limit\":0.0,\"total_api_calls_limit\":50,\"temperature\":0.0,\"top_p\":1.0,\"api_base\":\"https://ark.cn-beijing.volces.com/api/v3\",\"api_version\":\"2024-03-01-preview\",\"api_key\":\"**********\",\"stop\":[],\"completion_kwargs\":{},\"convert_system_to_user\":false,\"retry\":{\"retries\":5,\"min_wait\":1.0,\"max_wait\":15.0},\"delay\":0.0,\"fallbacks\":[]},\"embedding_model\":{\"name\":\"huggingface/Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B\",\"per_instance_cost_limit\":3.0,\"total_cost_limit\":0.0,\"total_api_calls_limit\":0,\"temperature\":0.0,\"top_p\":1.0,\"api_base\":\"http://127.0.0.1:8080\",\"api_version\":null,\"api_key\":null,\"stop\":[],\"completion_kwargs\":{},\"convert_system_to_user\":false,\"retry\":{\"retries\":5,\"min_wait\":1.0,\"max_wait\":15.0},\"delay\":0.0,\"fallbacks\":[]},\"max_requeries\":3,\"use_memory\":true,\"topk\":15},\"problem_statement\":{\"text\":\"/home/lhy/work/Env-Bench-Code/EnvBench\",\"extra_fields\":{},\"type\":\"text\",\"id\":\"taosdata__TDengine-32431\"},\"output_dir\":\"DEFAULT\",\"actions\":{\"open_pr\":false,\"pr_config\":{\"skip_if_commits_reference_issue\":true},\"apply_patch_locally\":false},\"env_var_path\":null}",
