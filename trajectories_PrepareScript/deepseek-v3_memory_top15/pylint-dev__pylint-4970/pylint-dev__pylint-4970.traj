The root cause was dependency installation not completing successfully. The solution was to install pytest individually using pip to enable test execution.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install pytest\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The pip installation of test dependencies failed due to missing build tools and Python development headers\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package requires compilation of C extensions during installation, which failed because the Ubuntu environment lacked essential build tools and Python development headers. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for compiling Python packages with native extensions. The solution was to install build-essential and python3-dev packages using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command was not found when running the test suite\n    - Solution: The required Python test dependencies, including pytest, were not installed in the environment. The root cause was missing package installations specified in test-requirements.txt. The solution was to install all dependencies using pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt.\n    - Action: pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because Python 3 and pip were not installed in the environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Python runtime and package manager in the Ubuntu system, which are essential for installing dependencies and running Python-based projects. Without these, pip-based installations and pytest executions failed. The solution was to install Python 3 and pip using the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to Python version incompatibility\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package required for testing was incompatible with Python 3.13. The root cause was outdated dependency compatibility. The solution was to install dependencies using Python 3.11, which required first installing the python3.11-venv package to enable virtual environment creation.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11-venv && python3.11 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && python -m pip install -U -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command failed due to an unsupported option in the installed version\n    - Solution: The --no-header option was unrecognized because the installed pytest version (5.3.2) was incompatible with this flag. The root cause was version mismatch between the test command and the environment configuration. The solution was to remove the unsupported option and use a compatible pytest command.\n    - Action: echo 'pytest -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/mypy/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Test dependencies were missing for the upgraded Python version\n    - Solution: Critical packages like pytest and typed-ast were installed for Python 3.6 but not for Python 3.9, causing ModuleNotFoundErrors. The root cause was pip pointing to the old Python version. The solution was to install the dependencies explicitly for Python 3.9 using its specific pip executable.\n    - Action: /usr/bin/python3.9 -m pip install --force-reinstall pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov typed-ast\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install dependencies using Python 3.11, which required first installing the python3.11-venv package to enable virtual environment creation.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11-venv && python3.11 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && python -m pip install -U -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command failed due to an unsupported option in the installed version\n    - Solution: The --no-header option was unrecognized because the installed pytest version (5.3.2) was incompatible with this flag. The root cause was version mismatch between the test command and the environment configuration. The solution was to remove the unsupported option and use a compatible pytest command.\n    - Action: echo 'pytest -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/mypy/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Test dependencies were missing for the upgraded Python version\n    - Solution: Critical packages like pytest and typed-ast were installed for Python 3.6 but not for Python 3.9, causing ModuleNotFoundErrors. The root cause was pip pointing to the old Python version. The solution was to install the dependencies explicitly for Python 3.9 using its specific pip executable.\n    - Action: /usr/bin/python3.9 -m pip install --force-reinstall pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov typed-ast\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because Python 3 and pip were not installed in the environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Python runtime and package manager in the Ubuntu system, which are essential for installing dependencies and running Python-based projects. Without these, pip-based installations and pytest executions failed. The solution was to install Python 3 and pip using the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to Python version incompatibility\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package required for testing was incompatible with Python 3.13.

The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command failed due to an unsupported option in the installed version\n    - Solution: The --no-header option was unrecognized because the installed pytest version (5.3.2) was incompatible with this flag. The root cause was version mismatch between the test command and the environment configuration. The solution was to remove the unsupported option and use a compatible pytest command.\n    - Action: echo 'pytest -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/mypy/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Test dependencies were missing for the upgraded Python version\n    - Solution: Critical packages like pytest and typed-ast were installed for Python 3.6 but not for Python 3.9, causing ModuleNotFoundErrors. The root cause was pip pointing to the old Python version. The solution was to install the dependencies explicitly for Python 3.9 using its specific pip executable.\n    - Action: /usr/bin/python3.9 -m pip install --force-reinstall pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov typed-ast\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10-dev, pypy3\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.cfg\n  install_command: pip install -U -r requirements_test.txt\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command was unavailable after dependency installation failures\n    - Solution: The initial pip install failed partially due to typed-ast compilation issues, leaving pytest uninstalled. The root cause was dependency installation not completing successfully. The solution was to install pytest individually using pip to enable test execution.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install pytest\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The pip installation of test dependencies failed due to missing build tools and Python development headers\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package requires compilation of C extensions during installation, which failed because the Ubuntu environment lacked essential build tools and Python development headers. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for compiling Python packages with native extensions. The solution was to install build-essential and python3-dev packages using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command was not found when running the test suite\n    - Solution: The required Python test dependencies, including pytest, were not installed in the environment. The root cause was missing package installations specified in test-requirements.txt. The solution was to install all dependencies using pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt.\n    - Action: pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because Python 3 and pip were not installed in the environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Python runtime and package manager in the Ubuntu system, which are essential for installing dependencies and running Python-based projects. Without these, pip-based installations and pytest executions failed. The solution was to install Python 3 and pip using the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to Python version incompatibility\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package required for testing was incompatible with Python 3.13. The root cause was outdated dependency compatibility. The solution was to install dependencies using Python 3.11, which required first installing the python3.11-venv package to enable virtual environment creation.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11-venv && python3.11 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && python -m pip install -U -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command failed due to an unsupported option in the installed version\n    - Solution: The --no-header option was unrecognized because the installed pytest version (5.3.2) was incompatible with this flag. The root cause was version mismatch between the test command and the environment configuration. The solution was to remove the unsupported option and use a compatible pytest command.\n    - Action: echo 'pytest -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/mypy/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Test dependencies were missing for the upgraded Python version\n    - Solution: Critical packages like pytest and typed-ast were installed for Python 3.6 but not for Python 3.9, causing ModuleNotFoundErrors. The root cause was pip pointing to the old Python version. The solution was to install the dependencies explicitly for Python 3.9 using its specific pip executable.\n    - Action: /usr/bin/python3.9 -m pip install --force-reinstall pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov typed-ast\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10-dev, pypy3\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.cfg\n  install_command: pip install -U -r requirements_test.txt\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command was unavailable after dependency installation failures\n    - Solution: The initial pip install failed partially due to typed-ast compilation issues, leaving pytest uninstalled. The root cause was dependency installation not completing successfully. The solution was to install pytest individually using pip to enable test execution.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install pytest\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The pip installation of test dependencies failed due to missing build tools and Python development headers\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package requires compilation of C extensions during installation, which failed because the Ubuntu environment lacked essential build tools and Python development headers. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for compiling Python packages with native extensions. The solution was to install build-essential and python3-dev packages using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command was not found when running the test suite\n    - Solution: The required Python test dependencies, including pytest, were not installed in the environment. The root cause was missing package installations specified in test-requirements.txt. The solution was to install all dependencies using pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt.\n    - Action: pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because Python 3 and pip were not installed in the environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Python runtime and package manager in the Ubuntu system, which are essential for installing dependencies and running Python-based projects. Without these, pip-based installations and pytest executions failed. The solution was to install Python 3 and pip using the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to Python version incompatibility\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package required for testing was incompatible with Python 3.13. The root cause was outdated dependency compatibility. The solution was to install dependencies using Python 3.11, which required first installing the python3.11-venv package to enable virtual environment creation.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11-venv && python3.11 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && python -m pip install -U -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command failed due to an unsupported option in the installed version\n    - Solution: The --no-header option was unrecognized because the installed pytest version (5.3.2) was incompatible with this flag. The root cause was version mismatch between the test command and the environment configuration. The solution was to remove the unsupported option and use a compatible pytest command.\n    - Action: echo 'pytest -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/mypy/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Test dependencies were missing for the upgraded Python version\n    - Solution: Critical packages like pytest and typed-ast were installed for Python 3.6 but not for Python 3.9, causing ModuleNotFoundErrors. The root cause was pip pointing to the old Python version. The solution was to install the dependencies explicitly for Python 3.9 using its specific pip executable.\n    - Action: /usr/bin/python3.9 -m pip install --force-reinstall pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov typed-ast\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10-dev, pypy3\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.cfg\n  install_command: pip install -U -r requirements_test.txt\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command was unavailable after dependency installation failures\n    - Solution: The initial pip install failed partially due to typed-ast compilation issues, leaving pytest uninstalled. The root cause was dependency installation not completing successfully. The solution was to install pytest individually using pip to enable test execution.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install pytest\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The pip installation of test dependencies failed due to missing build tools and Python development headers\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package requires compilation of C extensions during installation, which failed because the Ubuntu environment lacked essential build tools and Python development headers. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for compiling Python packages with native extensions. The solution was to install build-essential and python3-dev packages using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command was not found when running the test suite\n    - Solution: The required Python test dependencies, including pytest, were not installed in the environment. The root cause was missing package installations specified in test-requirements.txt. The solution was to install all dependencies using pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt.\n    - Action: pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because Python 3 and pip were not installed in the environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Python runtime and package manager in the Ubuntu system, which are essential for installing dependencies and running Python-based projects. Without these, pip-based installations and pytest executions failed. The solution was to install Python 3 and pip using the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to Python version incompatibility\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package required for testing was incompatible with Python 3.13. The root cause was outdated dependency compatibility. The solution was to install dependencies using Python 3.11, which required first installing the python3.11-venv package to enable virtual environment creation.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11-venv && python3.11 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && python -m pip install -U -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command failed due to an unsupported option in the installed version\n    - Solution: The --no-header option was unrecognized because the installed pytest version (5.3.2) was incompatible with this flag. The root cause was version mismatch between the test command and the environment configuration. The solution was to remove the unsupported option and use a compatible pytest command.\n    - Action: echo 'pytest -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/mypy/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Test dependencies were missing for the upgraded Python version\n    - Solution: Critical packages like pytest and typed-ast were installed for Python 3.6 but not for Python 3.9, causing ModuleNotFoundErrors. The root cause was pip pointing to the old Python version. The solution was to install the dependencies explicitly for Python 3.9 using its specific pip executable.\n    - Action: /usr/bin/python3.9 -m pip install --force-reinstall pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov typed-ast\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10-dev, pypy3\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.cfg\n  install_command: pip install -U -r requirements_test.txt\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command was unavailable after dependency installation failures\n    - Solution: The initial pip install failed partially due to typed-ast compilation issues, leaving pytest uninstalled. The root cause was dependency installation not completing successfully. The solution was to install pytest individually using pip to enable test execution.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install pytest\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The pip installation of test dependencies failed due to missing build tools and Python development headers\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package requires compilation of C extensions during installation, which failed because the Ubuntu environment lacked essential build tools and Python development headers. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for compiling Python packages with native extensions. The solution was to install build-essential and python3-dev packages using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command was not found when running the test suite\n    - Solution: The required Python test dependencies, including pytest, were not installed in the environment. The root cause was missing package installations specified in test-requirements.txt. The solution was to install all dependencies using pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt.\n    - Action: pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because Python 3 and pip were not installed in the environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Python runtime and package manager in the Ubuntu system, which are essential for installing dependencies and running Python-based projects. Without these, pip-based installations and pytest executions failed. The solution was to install Python 3 and pip using the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to Python version incompatibility\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package required for testing was incompatible with Python 3.13. The root cause was outdated dependency compatibility. The solution was to install dependencies using Python 3.11, which required first installing the python3.11-venv package to enable virtual environment creation.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11-venv && python3.11 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && python -m pip install -U -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command failed due to an unsupported option in the installed version\n    - Solution: The --no-header option was unrecognized because the installed pytest version (5.3.2) was incompatible with this flag. The root cause was version mismatch between the test command and the environment configuration. The solution was to remove the unsupported option and use a compatible pytest command.\n    - Action: echo 'pytest -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/mypy/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Test dependencies were missing for the upgraded Python version\n    - Solution: Critical packages like pytest and typed-ast were installed for Python 3.6 but not for Python 3.9, causing ModuleNotFoundErrors. The root cause was pip pointing to the old Python version. The solution was to install the dependencies explicitly for Python 3.9 using its specific pip executable.\n    - Action: /usr/bin/python3.9 -m pip install --force-reinstall pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov typed-ast\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10-dev, pypy3\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.cfg\n  install_command: pip install -U -r requirements_test.txt\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command was unavailable after dependency installation failures\n    - Solution: The initial pip install failed partially due to typed-ast compilation issues, leaving pytest uninstalled. The root cause was dependency installation not completing successfully. The solution was to install pytest individually using pip to enable test execution.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install pytest\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The pip installation of test dependencies failed due to missing build tools and Python development headers\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package requires compilation of C extensions during installation, which failed because the Ubuntu environment lacked essential build tools and Python development headers. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for compiling Python packages with native extensions. The solution was to install build-essential and python3-dev packages using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command was not found when running the test suite\n    - Solution: The required Python test dependencies, including pytest, were not installed in the environment. The root cause was missing package installations specified in test-requirements.txt. The solution was to install all dependencies using pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt.\n    - Action: pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because Python 3 and pip were not installed in the environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Python runtime and package manager in the Ubuntu system, which are essential for installing dependencies and running Python-based projects. Without these, pip-based installations and pytest executions failed. The solution was to install Python 3 and pip using the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to Python version incompatibility\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package required for testing was incompatible with Python 3.13. The root cause was outdated dependency compatibility. The solution was to install dependencies using Python 3.11, which required first installing the python3.11-venv package to enable virtual environment creation.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11-venv && python3.11 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && python -m pip install -U -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command failed due to an unsupported option in the installed version\n    - Solution: The --no-header option was unrecognized because the installed pytest version (5.3.2) was incompatible with this flag. The root cause was version mismatch between the test command and the environment configuration. The solution was to remove the unsupported option and use a compatible pytest command.\n    - Action: echo 'pytest -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/mypy/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Test dependencies were missing for the upgraded Python version\n    - Solution: Critical packages like pytest and typed-ast were installed for Python 3.6 but not for Python 3.9, causing ModuleNotFoundErrors. The root cause was pip pointing to the old Python version. The solution was to install the dependencies explicitly for Python 3.9 using its specific pip executable.\n    - Action: /usr/bin/python3.9 -m pip install --force-reinstall pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov typed-ast\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install pytest individually using pip to enable test execution.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install pytest\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The pip installation of test dependencies failed due to missing build tools and Python development headers\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package requires compilation of C extensions during installation, which failed because the Ubuntu environment lacked essential build tools and Python development headers. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for compiling Python packages with native extensions. The solution was to install build-essential and python3-dev packages using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command was not found when running the test suite\n    - Solution: The required Python test dependencies, including pytest, were not installed in the environment. The root cause was missing package installations specified in test-requirements.txt. The solution was to install all dependencies using pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt.\n    - Action: pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because Python 3 and pip were not installed in the environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Python runtime and package manager in the Ubuntu system, which are essential for installing dependencies and running Python-based projects. Without these, pip-based installations and pytest executions failed. The solution was to install Python 3 and pip using the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to Python version incompatibility\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package required for testing was incompatible with Python 3.13. The root cause was outdated dependency compatibility. The solution was to install dependencies using Python 3.11, which required first installing the python3.11-venv package to enable virtual environment creation.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11-venv && python3.11 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && python -m pip install -U -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command failed due to an unsupported option in the installed version\n    - Solution: The --no-header option was unrecognized because the installed pytest version (5.3.2) was incompatible with this flag. The root cause was version mismatch between the test command and the environment configuration. The solution was to remove the unsupported option and use a compatible pytest command.\n    - Action: echo 'pytest -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/mypy/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Test dependencies were missing for the upgraded Python version\n    - Solution: Critical packages like pytest and typed-ast were installed for Python 3.6 but not for Python 3.9, causing ModuleNotFoundErrors. The root cause was pip pointing to the old Python version. The solution was to install the dependencies explicitly for Python 3.9 using its specific pip executable.\n    - Action: /usr/bin/python3.9 -m pip install --force-reinstall pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov typed-ast\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10-dev, pypy3\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.cfg\n  install_command: pip install -U -r requirements_test.txt\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command was unavailable after dependency installation failures\n    - Solution: The initial pip install failed partially due to typed-ast compilation issues, leaving pytest uninstalled. The root cause was dependency installation not completing successfully. The solution was to install pytest individually using pip to enable test execution.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install pytest\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The pip installation of test dependencies failed due to missing build tools and Python development headers\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package requires compilation of C extensions during installation, which failed because the Ubuntu environment lacked essential build tools and Python development headers. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for compiling Python packages with native extensions. The solution was to install build-essential and python3-dev packages using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command was not found when running the test suite\n    - Solution: The required Python test dependencies, including pytest, were not installed in the environment. The root cause was missing package installations specified in test-requirements.txt. The solution was to install all dependencies using pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt.\n    - Action: pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because Python 3 and pip were not installed in the environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Python runtime and package manager in the Ubuntu system, which are essential for installing dependencies and running Python-based projects. Without these, pip-based installations and pytest executions failed. The solution was to install Python 3 and pip using the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to Python version incompatibility\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package required for testing was incompatible with Python 3.13. The root cause was outdated dependency compatibility. The solution was to install dependencies using Python 3.11, which required first installing the python3.11-venv package to enable virtual environment creation.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11-venv && python3.11 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && python -m pip install -U -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command failed due to an unsupported option in the installed version\n    - Solution: The --no-header option was unrecognized because the installed pytest version (5.3.2) was incompatible with this flag. The root cause was version mismatch between the test command and the environment configuration. The solution was to remove the unsupported option and use a compatible pytest command.\n    - Action: echo 'pytest -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/mypy/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Test dependencies were missing for the upgraded Python version\n    - Solution: Critical packages like pytest and typed-ast were installed for Python 3.6 but not for Python 3.9, causing ModuleNotFoundErrors. The root cause was pip pointing to the old Python version. The solution was to install the dependencies explicitly for Python 3.9 using its specific pip executable.\n    - Action: /usr/bin/python3.9 -m pip install --force-reinstall pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov typed-ast\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10-dev, pypy3\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.cfg\n  install_command: pip install -U -r requirements_test.txt\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command was unavailable after dependency installation failures\n    - Solution: The initial pip install failed partially due to typed-ast compilation issues, leaving pytest uninstalled. The root cause was dependency installation not completing successfully. The solution was to install pytest individually using pip to enable test execution.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install pytest\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The pip installation of test dependencies failed due to missing build tools and Python development headers\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package requires compilation of C extensions during installation, which failed because the Ubuntu environment lacked essential build tools and Python development headers. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for compiling Python packages with native extensions. The solution was to install build-essential and python3-dev packages using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command was not found when running the test suite\n    - Solution: The required Python test dependencies, including pytest, were not installed in the environment. The root cause was missing package installations specified in test-requirements.txt. The solution was to install all dependencies using pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt.\n    - Action: pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because Python 3 and pip were not installed in the environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Python runtime and package manager in the Ubuntu system, which are essential for installing dependencies and running Python-based projects. Without these, pip-based installations and pytest executions failed. The solution was to install Python 3 and pip using the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to Python version incompatibility\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package required for testing was incompatible with Python 3.13. The root cause was outdated dependency compatibility. The solution was to install dependencies using Python 3.11, which required first installing the python3.11-venv package to enable virtual environment creation.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11-venv && python3.11 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && python -m pip install -U -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command failed due to an unsupported option in the installed version\n    - Solution: The --no-header option was unrecognized because the installed pytest version (5.3.2) was incompatible with this flag. The root cause was version mismatch between the test command and the environment configuration. The solution was to remove the unsupported option and use a compatible pytest command.\n    - Action: echo 'pytest -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/mypy/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Test dependencies were missing for the upgraded Python version\n    - Solution: Critical packages like pytest and typed-ast were installed for Python 3.6 but not for Python 3.9, causing ModuleNotFoundErrors. The root cause was pip pointing to the old Python version. The solution was to install the dependencies explicitly for Python 3.9 using its specific pip executable.\n    - Action: /usr/bin/python3.9 -m pip install --force-reinstall pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov typed-ast\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10-dev, pypy3\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.cfg\n  install_command: pip install -U -r requirements_test.txt\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command was unavailable after dependency installation failures\n    - Solution: The initial pip install failed partially due to typed-ast compilation issues, leaving pytest uninstalled. The root cause was dependency installation not completing successfully. The solution was to install pytest individually using pip to enable test execution.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install pytest\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The pip installation of test dependencies failed due to missing build tools and Python development headers\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package requires compilation of C extensions during installation, which failed because the Ubuntu environment lacked essential build tools and Python development headers. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for compiling Python packages with native extensions. The solution was to install build-essential and python3-dev packages using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command was not found when running the test suite\n    - Solution: The required Python test dependencies, including pytest, were not installed in the environment. The root cause was missing package installations specified in test-requirements.txt. The solution was to install all dependencies using pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt.\n    - Action: pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because Python 3 and pip were not installed in the environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Python runtime and package manager in the Ubuntu system, which are essential for installing dependencies and running Python-based projects. Without these, pip-based installations and pytest executions failed. The solution was to install Python 3 and pip using the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to Python version incompatibility\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package required for testing was incompatible with Python 3.13. The root cause was outdated dependency compatibility. The solution was to install dependencies using Python 3.11, which required first installing the python3.11-venv package to enable virtual environment creation.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11-venv && python3.11 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && python -m pip install -U -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command failed due to an unsupported option in the installed version\n    - Solution: The --no-header option was unrecognized because the installed pytest version (5.3.2) was incompatible with this flag. The root cause was version mismatch between the test command and the environment configuration. The solution was to remove the unsupported option and use a compatible pytest command.\n    - Action: echo 'pytest -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/mypy/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Test dependencies were missing for the upgraded Python version\n    - Solution: Critical packages like pytest and typed-ast were installed for Python 3.6 but not for Python 3.9, causing ModuleNotFoundErrors. The root cause was pip pointing to the old Python version. The solution was to install the dependencies explicitly for Python 3.9 using its specific pip executable.\n    - Action: /usr/bin/python3.9 -m pip install --force-reinstall pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov typed-ast\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10-dev, pypy3\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.cfg\n  install_command: pip install -U -r requirements_test.txt\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command was unavailable after dependency installation failures\n    - Solution: The initial pip install failed partially due to typed-ast compilation issues, leaving pytest uninstalled. The root cause was dependency installation not completing successfully. The solution was to install pytest individually using pip to enable test execution.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install pytest\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The pip installation of test dependencies failed due to missing build tools and Python development headers\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package requires compilation of C extensions during installation, which failed because the Ubuntu environment lacked essential build tools and Python development headers. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for compiling Python packages with native extensions. The solution was to install build-essential and python3-dev packages using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command was not found when running the test suite\n    - Solution: The required Python test dependencies, including pytest, were not installed in the environment. The root cause was missing package installations specified in test-requirements.txt. The solution was to install all dependencies using pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt.\n    - Action: pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because Python 3 and pip were not installed in the environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Python runtime and package manager in the Ubuntu system, which are essential for installing dependencies and running Python-based projects. Without these, pip-based installations and pytest executions failed. The solution was to install Python 3 and pip using the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to Python version incompatibility\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package required for testing was incompatible with Python 3.13. The root cause was outdated dependency compatibility. The solution was to install dependencies using Python 3.11, which required first installing the python3.11-venv package to enable virtual environment creation.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11-venv && python3.11 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && python -m pip install -U -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command failed due to an unsupported option in the installed version\n    - Solution: The --no-header option was unrecognized because the installed pytest version (5.3.2) was incompatible with this flag. The root cause was version mismatch between the test command and the environment configuration. The solution was to remove the unsupported option and use a compatible pytest command.\n    - Action: echo 'pytest -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/mypy/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Test dependencies were missing for the upgraded Python version\n    - Solution: Critical packages like pytest and typed-ast were installed for Python 3.6 but not for Python 3.9, causing ModuleNotFoundErrors. The root cause was pip pointing to the old Python version. The solution was to install the dependencies explicitly for Python 3.9 using its specific pip executable.\n    - Action: /usr/bin/python3.9 -m pip install --force-reinstall pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov typed-ast\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10-dev, pypy3\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.cfg\n  install_command: pip install -U -r requirements_test.txt\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command was unavailable after dependency installation failures\n    - Solution: The initial pip install failed partially due to typed-ast compilation issues, leaving pytest uninstalled. The root cause was dependency installation not completing successfully. The solution was to install pytest individually using pip to enable test execution.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install pytest\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The pip installation of test dependencies failed due to missing build tools and Python development headers\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package requires compilation of C extensions during installation, which failed because the Ubuntu environment lacked essential build tools and Python development headers. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for compiling Python packages with native extensions. The solution was to install build-essential and python3-dev packages using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command was not found when running the test suite\n    - Solution: The required Python test dependencies, including pytest, were not installed in the environment. The root cause was missing package installations specified in test-requirements.txt. The solution was to install all dependencies using pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt.\n    - Action: pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because Python 3 and pip were not installed in the environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Python runtime and package manager in the Ubuntu system, which are essential for installing dependencies and running Python-based projects. Without these, pip-based installations and pytest executions failed. The solution was to install Python 3 and pip using the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to Python version incompatibility\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package required for testing was incompatible with Python 3.13. The root cause was outdated dependency compatibility. The solution was to install dependencies using Python 3.11, which required first installing the python3.11-venv package to enable virtual environment creation.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11-venv && python3.11 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && python -m pip install -U -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command failed due to an unsupported option in the installed version\n    - Solution: The --no-header option was unrecognized because the installed pytest version (5.3.2) was incompatible with this flag. The root cause was version mismatch between the test command and the environment configuration. The solution was to remove the unsupported option and use a compatible pytest command.\n    - Action: echo 'pytest -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/mypy/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Test dependencies were missing for the upgraded Python version\n    - Solution: Critical packages like pytest and typed-ast were installed for Python 3.6 but not for Python 3.9, causing ModuleNotFoundErrors. The root cause was pip pointing to the old Python version. The solution was to install the dependencies explicitly for Python 3.9 using its specific pip executable.\n    - Action: /usr/bin/python3.9 -m pip install --force-reinstall pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov typed-ast\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10-dev, pypy3\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.cfg\n  install_command: pip install -U -r requirements_test.txt\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command was unavailable after dependency installation failures\n    - Solution: The initial pip install failed partially due to typed-ast compilation issues, leaving pytest uninstalled. The root cause was dependency installation not completing successfully. The solution was to install pytest individually using pip to enable test execution.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install pytest\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The pip installation of test dependencies failed due to missing build tools and Python development headers\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package requires compilation of C extensions during installation, which failed because the Ubuntu environment lacked essential build tools and Python development headers. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for compiling Python packages with native extensions. The solution was to install build-essential and python3-dev packages using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command was not found when running the test suite\n    - Solution: The required Python test dependencies, including pytest, were not installed in the environment. The root cause was missing package installations specified in test-requirements.txt. The solution was to install all dependencies using pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt.\n    - Action: pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because Python 3 and pip were not installed in the environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Python runtime and package manager in the Ubuntu system, which are essential for installing dependencies and running Python-based projects. Without these, pip-based installations and pytest executions failed. The solution was to install Python 3 and pip using the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to Python version incompatibility\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package required for testing was incompatible with Python 3.13. The root cause was outdated dependency compatibility. The solution was to install dependencies using Python 3.11, which required first installing the python3.11-venv package to enable virtual environment creation.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11-venv && python3.11 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && python -m pip install -U -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command failed due to an unsupported option in the installed version\n    - Solution: The --no-header option was unrecognized because the installed pytest version (5.3.2) was incompatible with this flag. The root cause was version mismatch between the test command and the environment configuration. The solution was to remove the unsupported option and use a compatible pytest command.\n    - Action: echo 'pytest -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/mypy/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Test dependencies were missing for the upgraded Python version\n    - Solution: Critical packages like pytest and typed-ast were installed for Python 3.6 but not for Python 3.9, causing ModuleNotFoundErrors. The root cause was pip pointing to the old Python version. The solution was to install the dependencies explicitly for Python 3.9 using its specific pip executable.\n    - Action: /usr/bin/python3.9 -m pip install --force-reinstall pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov typed-ast\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Python\n  version_constraint: 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10-dev, pypy3\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: setup.cfg\n  install_command: pip install -U -r requirements_test.txt\n  name: pip\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- pytest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command was unavailable after dependency installation failures\n    - Solution: The initial pip install failed partially due to typed-ast compilation issues, leaving pytest uninstalled. The root cause was dependency installation not completing successfully. The solution was to install pytest individually using pip to enable test execution.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install pytest\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The pip installation of test dependencies failed due to missing build tools and Python development headers\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package requires compilation of C extensions during installation, which failed because the Ubuntu environment lacked essential build tools and Python development headers. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for compiling Python packages with native extensions. The solution was to install build-essential and python3-dev packages using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command was not found when running the test suite\n    - Solution: The required Python test dependencies, including pytest, were not installed in the environment. The root cause was missing package installations specified in test-requirements.txt. The solution was to install all dependencies using pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt.\n    - Action: pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because Python 3 and pip were not installed in the environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Python runtime and package manager in the Ubuntu system, which are essential for installing dependencies and running Python-based projects. Without these, pip-based installations and pytest executions failed. The solution was to install Python 3 and pip using the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to Python version incompatibility\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package required for testing was incompatible with Python 3.13. The root cause was outdated dependency compatibility. The solution was to install dependencies using Python 3.11, which required first installing the python3.11-venv package to enable virtual environment creation.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11-venv && python3.11 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && python -m pip install -U -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command failed due to an unsupported option in the installed version\n    - Solution: The --no-header option was unrecognized because the installed pytest version (5.3.2) was incompatible with this flag. The root cause was version mismatch between the test command and the environment configuration. The solution was to remove the unsupported option and use a compatible pytest command.\n    - Action: echo 'pytest -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/mypy/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Test dependencies were missing for the upgraded Python version\n    - Solution: Critical packages like pytest and typed-ast were installed for Python 3.6 but not for Python 3.9, causing ModuleNotFoundErrors. The root cause was pip pointing to the old Python version. The solution was to install the dependencies explicitly for Python 3.9 using its specific pip executable.\n    - Action: /usr/bin/python3.9 -m pip install --force-reinstall pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov typed-ast\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The root cause was dependency installation not completing successfully. The solution was to install pytest individually using pip to enable test execution.\n    - Action: python3 -m pip install pytest\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The pip installation of test dependencies failed due to missing build tools and Python development headers\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package requires compilation of C extensions during installation, which failed because the Ubuntu environment lacked essential build tools and Python development headers. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for compiling Python packages with native extensions. The solution was to install build-essential and python3-dev packages using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command was not found when running the test suite\n    - Solution: The required Python test dependencies, including pytest, were not installed in the environment. The root cause was missing package installations specified in test-requirements.txt. The solution was to install all dependencies using pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt.\n    - Action: pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial test command failed because Python 3 and pip were not installed in the environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was a missing Python runtime and package manager in the Ubuntu system, which are essential for installing dependencies and running Python-based projects. Without these, pip-based installations and pytest executions failed. The solution was to install Python 3 and pip using the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to Python version incompatibility\n    - Solution: The typed-ast package required for testing was incompatible with Python 3.13. The root cause was outdated dependency compatibility. The solution was to install dependencies using Python 3.11, which required first installing the python3.11-venv package to enable virtual environment creation.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11-venv && python3.11 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && python -m pip install -U -r test-requirements.txt\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Pip was unavailable for the newly installed Python version, preventing dependency installation.\n    - Solution: Debian/Ubuntu systems disable ensurepip for system Python installations. The root cause was missing pip in the Python 3.11 environment. The solution was to install the system's python3-pip package to enable pip functionality.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The pytest command failed due to an unsupported option in the installed version\n    - Solution: The --no-header option was unrecognized because the installed pytest version (5.3.2) was incompatible with this flag. The root cause was version mismatch between the test command and the environment configuration. The solution was to remove the unsupported option and use a compatible pytest command.\n    - Action: echo 'pytest -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/mypy/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Test dependencies were missing for the upgraded Python version\n    - Solution: Critical packages like pytest and typed-ast were installed for Python 3.6 but not for Python 3.9, causing ModuleNotFoundErrors. The root cause was pip pointing to the old Python version. The solution was to install the dependencies explicitly for Python 3.9 using its specific pip executable.\n    - Action: /usr/bin/python3.9 -m pip install --force-reinstall pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov typed-ast\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

However, the test is failing because the `completely_unknown` module does not exist, and the test does not handle this scenario correctly.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Test Intent**: The test likely verifies that `pylint` does not import files from the local directory when `PYTHONPATH` is modified.\n2. **Issue**: The test assumes `pylint` will handle the `import completely_unknown` gracefully, but the test itself is not properly mocking or handling the `ModuleNotFoundError`.\n\n### Solution:\nThe test should either:\n1. Mock the `import` statement to simulate the missing module, or\n2.

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\",\"instance_template\":\"We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\\n\\n{{repo_related_info}}\\n\\n{{cross_repo_knowledge}}\\n\\nTASK TIPS:\\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them.
