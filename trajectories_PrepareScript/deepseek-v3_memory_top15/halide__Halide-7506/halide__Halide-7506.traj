The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed LLVM version was incompatible with project requirements\n    - Solution: The default LLVM package version (3.8) did not match the project's supported versions (3.9.1+). The root cause was a version mismatch in the package repository. The solution was to uninstall the incompatible version and install the specific required version (LLVM 3.9) using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get remove -y llvm llvm-dev && apt-get install -y llvm-3.9-dev\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Persistent build failures during make libs due to compiler/environment incompatibilities\n    - Solution: Source builds failed with lseek64 and std::max errors indicating toolchain mismatches. The root cause was unsupported configurations in Alpine 3.22. The solution was installing ponyc via ponyup to bypass source compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add curl && sh -c \"$(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponylang/ponyup/latest-release/ponyup-init.sh)\" && ponyup update ponyc release\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The build system failed to locate the LLVM configuration tool\n    - Solution: The build process required the LLVM_CONFIG environment variable to point to the llvm-config binary. The root cause was an unset environment variable after installing LLVM 3.9. The solution was to explicitly set LLVM_CONFIG to the correct binary path before building.\n    - Action: export LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/bin/llvm-config-3.9\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Conan version incompatibility with the project's conanfile.py\n    - Solution: The installed Conan version (2.x) used a different API than the project's conanfile.py expected (v1 syntax with 'from conans import...'). The root cause was API deprecation between Conan versions. The solution was to downgrade to a compatible Conan version (1.39.0).\n    - Action: pip uninstall -y conan && pip install conan==1.39.0\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The Python interpreter was not available, causing CMake configuration to fail when Python-dependent scripts were required\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Python, which was needed for test-related scripts and CMake configuration steps in the project. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The root cause was an unset environment variable after installing LLVM 3.9. The solution was to explicitly set LLVM_CONFIG to the correct binary path before building.\n    - Action: export LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/bin/llvm-config-3.9\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Conan version incompatibility with the project's conanfile.py\n    - Solution: The installed Conan version (2.x) used a different API than the project's conanfile.py expected (v1 syntax with 'from conans import...'). The root cause was API deprecation between Conan versions. The solution was to downgrade to a compatible Conan version (1.39.0).\n    - Action: pip uninstall -y conan && pip install conan==1.39.0\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The Python interpreter was not available, causing CMake configuration to fail when Python-dependent scripts were required\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Python, which was needed for test-related scripts and CMake configuration steps in the project. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed LLVM version was incompatible with project requirements\n    - Solution: The default LLVM package version (3.8) did not match the project's supported versions (3.9.1+). The root cause was a version mismatch in the package repository. The solution was to uninstall the incompatible version and install the specific required version (LLVM 3.9) using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get remove -y llvm llvm-dev && apt-get install -y llvm-3.9-dev\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Persistent build failures during make libs due to compiler/environment incompatibilities\n    - Solution: Source builds failed with lseek64 and std::max errors indicating toolchain mismatches. The root cause was unsupported configurations in Alpine 3.22. The solution was installing ponyc via ponyup to bypass source compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add curl && sh -c \"$(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponylang/ponyup/latest-release/ponyup-init.sh)\" && ponyup update ponyc release\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The build system failed to locate the LLVM configuration tool\n    - Solution: The build process required the LLVM_CONFIG environment variable to point to the llvm-config binary.

Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Conan version incompatibility with the project's conanfile.py\n    - Solution: The installed Conan version (2.x) used a different API than the project's conanfile.py expected (v1 syntax with 'from conans import...'). The root cause was API deprecation between Conan versions. The solution was to downgrade to a compatible Conan version (1.39.0).\n    - Action: pip uninstall -y conan && pip install conan==1.39.0\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The Python interpreter was not available, causing CMake configuration to fail when Python-dependent scripts were required\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Python, which was needed for test-related scripts and CMake configuration steps in the project. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- cmake\n- Ninja\nlanguage:\n  name: C++\n  version_constraint: C++17 or later\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: 'vcpkg install halide:x64-windows # or x64-linux/x64-osx'\n  name: vcpkg\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - clang\n  - lld\n  - clang-tools-extra\n  - libpng\n  - libjpeg-turbo\n  likely_required:\n  - llvm\n  - python3\n  - libc++\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed LLVM version was incompatible with project requirements\n    - Solution: The default LLVM package version (3.8) did not match the project's supported versions (3.9.1+). The root cause was a version mismatch in the package repository. The solution was to uninstall the incompatible version and install the specific required version (LLVM 3.9) using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get remove -y llvm llvm-dev && apt-get install -y llvm-3.9-dev\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Persistent build failures during make libs due to compiler/environment incompatibilities\n    - Solution: Source builds failed with lseek64 and std::max errors indicating toolchain mismatches. The root cause was unsupported configurations in Alpine 3.22. The solution was installing ponyc via ponyup to bypass source compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add curl && sh -c \"$(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponylang/ponyup/latest-release/ponyup-init.sh)\" && ponyup update ponyc release\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The build system failed to locate the LLVM configuration tool\n    - Solution: The build process required the LLVM_CONFIG environment variable to point to the llvm-config binary. The root cause was an unset environment variable after installing LLVM 3.9. The solution was to explicitly set LLVM_CONFIG to the correct binary path before building.\n    - Action: export LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/bin/llvm-config-3.9\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Conan version incompatibility with the project's conanfile.py\n    - Solution: The installed Conan version (2.x) used a different API than the project's conanfile.py expected (v1 syntax with 'from conans import...'). The root cause was API deprecation between Conan versions. The solution was to downgrade to a compatible Conan version (1.39.0).\n    - Action: pip uninstall -y conan && pip install conan==1.39.0\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The Python interpreter was not available, causing CMake configuration to fail when Python-dependent scripts were required\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Python, which was needed for test-related scripts and CMake configuration steps in the project. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Build-essential (for GCC and other build tools)\n\nLet's start by updating the package index and installing these dependencies.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- cmake\n- Ninja\nlanguage:\n  name: C++\n  version_constraint: C++17 or later\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: 'vcpkg install halide:x64-windows # or x64-linux/x64-osx'\n  name: vcpkg\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - clang\n  - lld\n  - clang-tools-extra\n  - libpng\n  - libjpeg-turbo\n  likely_required:\n  - llvm\n  - python3\n  - libc++\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed LLVM version was incompatible with project requirements\n    - Solution: The default LLVM package version (3.8) did not match the project's supported versions (3.9.1+). The root cause was a version mismatch in the package repository. The solution was to uninstall the incompatible version and install the specific required version (LLVM 3.9) using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get remove -y llvm llvm-dev && apt-get install -y llvm-3.9-dev\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Persistent build failures during make libs due to compiler/environment incompatibilities\n    - Solution: Source builds failed with lseek64 and std::max errors indicating toolchain mismatches. The root cause was unsupported configurations in Alpine 3.22. The solution was installing ponyc via ponyup to bypass source compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add curl && sh -c \"$(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponylang/ponyup/latest-release/ponyup-init.sh)\" && ponyup update ponyc release\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The build system failed to locate the LLVM configuration tool\n    - Solution: The build process required the LLVM_CONFIG environment variable to point to the llvm-config binary. The root cause was an unset environment variable after installing LLVM 3.9. The solution was to explicitly set LLVM_CONFIG to the correct binary path before building.\n    - Action: export LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/bin/llvm-config-3.9\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Conan version incompatibility with the project's conanfile.py\n    - Solution: The installed Conan version (2.x) used a different API than the project's conanfile.py expected (v1 syntax with 'from conans import...'). The root cause was API deprecation between Conan versions. The solution was to downgrade to a compatible Conan version (1.39.0).\n    - Action: pip uninstall -y conan && pip install conan==1.39.0\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The Python interpreter was not available, causing CMake configuration to fail when Python-dependent scripts were required\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Python, which was needed for test-related scripts and CMake configuration steps in the project. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- cmake\n- Ninja\nlanguage:\n  name: C++\n  version_constraint: C++17 or later\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: 'vcpkg install halide:x64-windows # or x64-linux/x64-osx'\n  name: vcpkg\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - clang\n  - lld\n  - clang-tools-extra\n  - libpng\n  - libjpeg-turbo\n  likely_required:\n  - llvm\n  - python3\n  - libc++\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed LLVM version was incompatible with project requirements\n    - Solution: The default LLVM package version (3.8) did not match the project's supported versions (3.9.1+). The root cause was a version mismatch in the package repository. The solution was to uninstall the incompatible version and install the specific required version (LLVM 3.9) using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get remove -y llvm llvm-dev && apt-get install -y llvm-3.9-dev\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Persistent build failures during make libs due to compiler/environment incompatibilities\n    - Solution: Source builds failed with lseek64 and std::max errors indicating toolchain mismatches. The root cause was unsupported configurations in Alpine 3.22. The solution was installing ponyc via ponyup to bypass source compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add curl && sh -c \"$(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponylang/ponyup/latest-release/ponyup-init.sh)\" && ponyup update ponyc release\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The build system failed to locate the LLVM configuration tool\n    - Solution: The build process required the LLVM_CONFIG environment variable to point to the llvm-config binary. The root cause was an unset environment variable after installing LLVM 3.9. The solution was to explicitly set LLVM_CONFIG to the correct binary path before building.\n    - Action: export LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/bin/llvm-config-3.9\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Conan version incompatibility with the project's conanfile.py\n    - Solution: The installed Conan version (2.x) used a different API than the project's conanfile.py expected (v1 syntax with 'from conans import...'). The root cause was API deprecation between Conan versions. The solution was to downgrade to a compatible Conan version (1.39.0).\n    - Action: pip uninstall -y conan && pip install conan==1.39.0\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The Python interpreter was not available, causing CMake configuration to fail when Python-dependent scripts were required\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Python, which was needed for test-related scripts and CMake configuration steps in the project. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- cmake\n- Ninja\nlanguage:\n  name: C++\n  version_constraint: C++17 or later\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: 'vcpkg install halide:x64-windows # or x64-linux/x64-osx'\n  name: vcpkg\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - clang\n  - lld\n  - clang-tools-extra\n  - libpng\n  - libjpeg-turbo\n  likely_required:\n  - llvm\n  - python3\n  - libc++\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed LLVM version was incompatible with project requirements\n    - Solution: The default LLVM package version (3.8) did not match the project's supported versions (3.9.1+). The root cause was a version mismatch in the package repository. The solution was to uninstall the incompatible version and install the specific required version (LLVM 3.9) using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get remove -y llvm llvm-dev && apt-get install -y llvm-3.9-dev\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Persistent build failures during make libs due to compiler/environment incompatibilities\n    - Solution: Source builds failed with lseek64 and std::max errors indicating toolchain mismatches. The root cause was unsupported configurations in Alpine 3.22. The solution was installing ponyc via ponyup to bypass source compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add curl && sh -c \"$(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponylang/ponyup/latest-release/ponyup-init.sh)\" && ponyup update ponyc release\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The build system failed to locate the LLVM configuration tool\n    - Solution: The build process required the LLVM_CONFIG environment variable to point to the llvm-config binary. The root cause was an unset environment variable after installing LLVM 3.9. The solution was to explicitly set LLVM_CONFIG to the correct binary path before building.\n    - Action: export LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/bin/llvm-config-3.9\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Conan version incompatibility with the project's conanfile.py\n    - Solution: The installed Conan version (2.x) used a different API than the project's conanfile.py expected (v1 syntax with 'from conans import...'). The root cause was API deprecation between Conan versions. The solution was to downgrade to a compatible Conan version (1.39.0).\n    - Action: pip uninstall -y conan && pip install conan==1.39.0\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The Python interpreter was not available, causing CMake configuration to fail when Python-dependent scripts were required\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Python, which was needed for test-related scripts and CMake configuration steps in the project. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Halide also\n16:provides a Python binding that provides full support for writing Halide embedded\n17:in Python without C++.\n18:\n19:Halide requires C++17 (or later) to use.\n20:\n21:For more detail about what Halide is, see http://halide-lang.org.\n22:\n23:For API documentation see http://halide-lang.org/docs\n24:\n25:To see some example code, look in the tutorials directory.\n26:\n27:If you've acquired a full source distribution and want to build Halide, see the\n28:[notes below](#building-halide-with-cmake).\n29:\n30:# Getting Halide\n31:\n32:## Binary tarballs\n33:\n34:The latest version of Halide can always be found on GitHub\n35:at https://github.com/halide/Halide/releases\n36:\n37:We provide binary releases for many popular platforms and architectures, \n38:including 32/64-bit x86 Windows, 64-bit macOS, and 32/64-bit x86/ARM\n39:Ubuntu Linux.\n40:\n41:## Vcpkg\n42:\n43:If you use [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to manage dependencies,\n44:you can install Halide via:\n45:\n46:```\n47:$ vcpkg install halide:x64-windows # or x64-linux/x64-osx\n48:```\n49:\n50:One caveat: vcpkg installs only the minimum Halide backends required to compile\n51:code for the active platform. If you want to include all the backends, you\n52:should install `halide[target-all]:x64-windows` instead. Note that since this\n53:will build LLVM, it will take a _lot_ of disk space (up to 100GB).\n54:\n55:## Homebrew\n56:\n57:Alternatively, if you use macOS, you can install Halide via\n58:[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) like so:\n59:\n60:```\n61:$ brew install halide\n62:```\n63:\n64:## Other package managers\n65:\n66:We are interested in bringing Halide to other popular package managers and\n67:Linux distribution repositories including, but not limited to, Conan,\n68:Debian, [Ubuntu (or PPA)](https://github.com/halide/Halide/issues/5285),\n69:CentOS/Fedora, and Arch. If you have experience publishing packages we would be\n70:happy to work with you!\n71:\n72:If you are a maintainer of any other package distribution platform, we would be\n73:excited to work with you, too.\n74:\n75:# Platform Support\n76:\n77:There are two sets of platform requirements relevant to Halide: those required\n78:to run the compiler library in either JIT or AOT mode, and those required to run\n79:the _binary outputs_ of the AOT compiler.\n80:\n81:These are the **tested** host toolchain and platform combinations for building\n82:and running the Halide compiler library.\n83:\n84:| Compiler   | Version      | OS                     | Architectures   |\n85:|------------|--------------|------------------------|-----------------|\n86:| GCC        | 7.5          | Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS | x86, x64, ARM32 |\n87:| GCC        | 7.5          | Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS | ARM32, ARM64    |\n88:| MSVC       | 2019 (19.28) | Windows 10 (20H2)      | x86, x64        |\n89:| AppleClang | 12.0.0       | macOS 10.15            | x86_64          |\n90:| AppleClang | 12.0.0       | macOS 11.1             | ARM64           |\n91:\n92:Some users have successfully built Halide for Linux using Clang 9.0.0+, for\n93:Windows using ClangCL 11.0.0+, and for Windows ARM64 by cross-compiling with\n94:MSVC. We do not actively test these scenarios, however, so your mileage may\n95:vary.\n96:\n97:Beyond these, we are willing to support (by accepting PRs for) platform and\n98:toolchain combinations that still receive _active, first-party, public support_\n99:from their original vendors. For instance, at time of writing, this excludes\n100:Windows 7 and includes Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.\n(346 more lines below)\n",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- cmake\n- Ninja\nlanguage:\n  name: C++\n  version_constraint: C++17 or later\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: 'vcpkg install halide:x64-windows # or x64-linux/x64-osx'\n  name: vcpkg\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - clang\n  - lld\n  - clang-tools-extra\n  - libpng\n  - libjpeg-turbo\n  likely_required:\n  - llvm\n  - python3\n  - libc++\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed LLVM version was incompatible with project requirements\n    - Solution: The default LLVM package version (3.8) did not match the project's supported versions (3.9.1+). The root cause was a version mismatch in the package repository. The solution was to uninstall the incompatible version and install the specific required version (LLVM 3.9) using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get remove -y llvm llvm-dev && apt-get install -y llvm-3.9-dev\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Persistent build failures during make libs due to compiler/environment incompatibilities\n    - Solution: Source builds failed with lseek64 and std::max errors indicating toolchain mismatches. The root cause was unsupported configurations in Alpine 3.22. The solution was installing ponyc via ponyup to bypass source compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add curl && sh -c \"$(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponylang/ponyup/latest-release/ponyup-init.sh)\" && ponyup update ponyc release\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The build system failed to locate the LLVM configuration tool\n    - Solution: The build process required the LLVM_CONFIG environment variable to point to the llvm-config binary. The root cause was an unset environment variable after installing LLVM 3.9. The solution was to explicitly set LLVM_CONFIG to the correct binary path before building.\n    - Action: export LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/bin/llvm-config-3.9\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Conan version incompatibility with the project's conanfile.py\n    - Solution: The installed Conan version (2.x) used a different API than the project's conanfile.py expected (v1 syntax with 'from conans import...'). The root cause was API deprecation between Conan versions. The solution was to downgrade to a compatible Conan version (1.39.0).\n    - Action: pip uninstall -y conan && pip install conan==1.39.0\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The Python interpreter was not available, causing CMake configuration to fail when Python-dependent scripts were required\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Python, which was needed for test-related scripts and CMake configuration steps in the project. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Halide\n5:currently targets:\n6:\n7:- CPU architectures: X86, ARM, Hexagon, PowerPC, RISC-V\n8:- Operating systems: Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Qualcomm QuRT\n9:- GPU Compute APIs: CUDA, OpenCL, OpenGL Compute Shaders, Apple Metal, Microsoft\n10:  Direct X 12\n11:\n12:Rather than being a standalone programming language, Halide is embedded in C++.\n13:This means you write C++ code that builds an in-memory representation of a\n14:Halide pipeline using Halide's C++ API. You can then compile this representation\n15:to an object file, or JIT-compile it and run it in the same process. Halide also\n16:provides a Python binding that provides full support for writing Halide embedded\n17:in Python without C++.\n18:\n19:Halide requires C++17 (or later) to use.\n20:\n21:For more detail about what Halide is, see http://halide-lang.org.\n22:\n23:For API documentation see http://halide-lang.org/docs\n24:\n25:To see some example code, look in the tutorials directory.\n26:\n27:If you've acquired a full source distribution and want to build Halide, see the\n28:[notes below](#building-halide-with-cmake).\n29:\n30:# Getting Halide\n31:\n32:## Binary tarballs\n33:\n34:The latest version of Halide can always be found on GitHub\n35:at https://github.com/halide/Halide/releases\n36:\n37:We provide binary releases for many popular platforms and architectures, \n38:including 32/64-bit x86 Windows, 64-bit macOS, and 32/64-bit x86/ARM\n39:Ubuntu Linux.\n40:\n41:## Vcpkg\n42:\n43:If you use [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to manage dependencies,\n44:you can install Halide via:\n45:\n46:```\n47:$ vcpkg install halide:x64-windows # or x64-linux/x64-osx\n48:```\n49:\n50:One caveat: vcpkg installs only the minimum Halide backends required to compile\n51:code for the active platform. If you want to include all the backends, you\n52:should install `halide[target-all]:x64-windows` instead. Note that since this\n53:will build LLVM, it will take a _lot_ of disk space (up to 100GB).\n54:\n55:## Homebrew\n56:\n57:Alternatively, if you use macOS, you can install Halide via\n58:[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) like so:\n59:\n60:```\n61:$ brew install halide\n62:```\n63:\n64:## Other package managers\n65:\n66:We are interested in bringing Halide to other popular package managers and\n67:Linux distribution repositories including, but not limited to, Conan,\n68:Debian, [Ubuntu (or PPA)](https://github.com/halide/Halide/issues/5285),\n69:CentOS/Fedora, and Arch. If you have experience publishing packages we would be\n70:happy to work with you!\n71:\n72:If you are a maintainer of any other package distribution platform, we would be\n73:excited to work with you, too.\n74:\n75:# Platform Support\n76:\n77:There are two sets of platform requirements relevant to Halide: those required\n78:to run the compiler library in either JIT or AOT mode, and those required to run\n79:the _binary outputs_ of the AOT compiler.\n80:\n81:These are the **tested** host toolchain and platform combinations for building\n82:and running the Halide compiler library.\n83:\n84:| Compiler   | Version      | OS                     | Architectures   |\n85:|------------|--------------|------------------------|-----------------|\n86:| GCC        | 7.5          | Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS | x86, x64, ARM32 |\n87:| GCC        | 7.5          | Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS | ARM32, ARM64    |\n88:| MSVC       | 2019 (19.28) | Windows 10 (20H2)      | x86, x64        |\n89:| AppleClang | 12.0.0       | macOS 10.15            | x86_64          |\n90:| AppleClang | 12.0.0       | macOS 11.1             | ARM64           |\n91:\n92:Some users have successfully built Halide for Linux using Clang 9.0.0+, for\n93:Windows using ClangCL 11.0.0+, and for Windows ARM64 by cross-compiling with\n94:MSVC. We do not actively test these scenarios, however, so your mileage may\n95:vary.\n96:\n97:Beyond these, we are willing to support (by accepting PRs for) platform and\n98:toolchain combinations that still receive _active, first-party, public support_\n99:from their original vendors. For instance, at time of writing, this excludes\n100:Windows 7 and includes Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.\n(346 more lines below)\n\n(Open file: /testbed/README.md)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- cmake\n- Ninja\nlanguage:\n  name: C++\n  version_constraint: C++17 or later\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: 'vcpkg install halide:x64-windows # or x64-linux/x64-osx'\n  name: vcpkg\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - clang\n  - lld\n  - clang-tools-extra\n  - libpng\n  - libjpeg-turbo\n  likely_required:\n  - llvm\n  - python3\n  - libc++\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed LLVM version was incompatible with project requirements\n    - Solution: The default LLVM package version (3.8) did not match the project's supported versions (3.9.1+). The root cause was a version mismatch in the package repository. The solution was to uninstall the incompatible version and install the specific required version (LLVM 3.9) using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get remove -y llvm llvm-dev && apt-get install -y llvm-3.9-dev\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Persistent build failures during make libs due to compiler/environment incompatibilities\n    - Solution: Source builds failed with lseek64 and std::max errors indicating toolchain mismatches. The root cause was unsupported configurations in Alpine 3.22. The solution was installing ponyc via ponyup to bypass source compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add curl && sh -c \"$(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponylang/ponyup/latest-release/ponyup-init.sh)\" && ponyup update ponyc release\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The build system failed to locate the LLVM configuration tool\n    - Solution: The build process required the LLVM_CONFIG environment variable to point to the llvm-config binary. The root cause was an unset environment variable after installing LLVM 3.9. The solution was to explicitly set LLVM_CONFIG to the correct binary path before building.\n    - Action: export LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/bin/llvm-config-3.9\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Conan version incompatibility with the project's conanfile.py\n    - Solution: The installed Conan version (2.x) used a different API than the project's conanfile.py expected (v1 syntax with 'from conans import...'). The root cause was API deprecation between Conan versions. The solution was to downgrade to a compatible Conan version (1.39.0).\n    - Action: pip uninstall -y conan && pip install conan==1.39.0\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The Python interpreter was not available, causing CMake configuration to fail when Python-dependent scripts were required\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Python, which was needed for test-related scripts and CMake configuration steps in the project. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

This suggests that the project requires LLVM 14, Clang 14, and Ninja for building.\n\nNext, I will check the `pip.yml` file to see if it provides additional insights into the build and test setup.",

Halide\n5:currently targets:\n6:\n7:- CPU architectures: X86, ARM, Hexagon, PowerPC, RISC-V\n8:- Operating systems: Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Qualcomm QuRT\n9:- GPU Compute APIs: CUDA, OpenCL, OpenGL Compute Shaders, Apple Metal, Microsoft\n10:  Direct X 12\n11:\n12:Rather than being a standalone programming language, Halide is embedded in C++.\n13:This means you write C++ code that builds an in-memory representation of a\n14:Halide pipeline using Halide's C++ API. You can then compile this representation\n15:to an object file, or JIT-compile it and run it in the same process. Halide also\n16:provides a Python binding that provides full support for writing Halide embedded\n17:in Python without C++.\n18:\n19:Halide requires C++17 (or later) to use.\n20:\n21:For more detail about what Halide is, see http://halide-lang.org.\n22:\n23:For API documentation see http://halide-lang.org/docs\n24:\n25:To see some example code, look in the tutorials directory.\n26:\n27:If you've acquired a full source distribution and want to build Halide, see the\n28:[notes below](#building-halide-with-cmake).\n29:\n30:# Getting Halide\n31:\n32:## Binary tarballs\n33:\n34:The latest version of Halide can always be found on GitHub\n35:at https://github.com/halide/Halide/releases\n36:\n37:We provide binary releases for many popular platforms and architectures, \n38:including 32/64-bit x86 Windows, 64-bit macOS, and 32/64-bit x86/ARM\n39:Ubuntu Linux.\n40:\n41:## Vcpkg\n42:\n43:If you use [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to manage dependencies,\n44:you can install Halide via:\n45:\n46:```\n47:$ vcpkg install halide:x64-windows # or x64-linux/x64-osx\n48:```\n49:\n50:One caveat: vcpkg installs only the minimum Halide backends required to compile\n51:code for the active platform.

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- cmake\n- Ninja\nlanguage:\n  name: C++\n  version_constraint: C++17 or later\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: 'vcpkg install halide:x64-windows # or x64-linux/x64-osx'\n  name: vcpkg\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - clang\n  - lld\n  - clang-tools-extra\n  - libpng\n  - libjpeg-turbo\n  likely_required:\n  - llvm\n  - python3\n  - libc++\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed LLVM version was incompatible with project requirements\n    - Solution: The default LLVM package version (3.8) did not match the project's supported versions (3.9.1+). The root cause was a version mismatch in the package repository. The solution was to uninstall the incompatible version and install the specific required version (LLVM 3.9) using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get remove -y llvm llvm-dev && apt-get install -y llvm-3.9-dev\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Persistent build failures during make libs due to compiler/environment incompatibilities\n    - Solution: Source builds failed with lseek64 and std::max errors indicating toolchain mismatches. The root cause was unsupported configurations in Alpine 3.22. The solution was installing ponyc via ponyup to bypass source compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add curl && sh -c \"$(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponylang/ponyup/latest-release/ponyup-init.sh)\" && ponyup update ponyc release\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The build system failed to locate the LLVM configuration tool\n    - Solution: The build process required the LLVM_CONFIG environment variable to point to the llvm-config binary. The root cause was an unset environment variable after installing LLVM 3.9. The solution was to explicitly set LLVM_CONFIG to the correct binary path before building.\n    - Action: export LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/bin/llvm-config-3.9\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Conan version incompatibility with the project's conanfile.py\n    - Solution: The installed Conan version (2.x) used a different API than the project's conanfile.py expected (v1 syntax with 'from conans import...'). The root cause was API deprecation between Conan versions. The solution was to downgrade to a compatible Conan version (1.39.0).\n    - Action: pip uninstall -y conan && pip install conan==1.39.0\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The Python interpreter was not available, causing CMake configuration to fail when Python-dependent scripts were required\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Python, which was needed for test-related scripts and CMake configuration steps in the project. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Halide\n5:currently targets:\n6:\n7:- CPU architectures: X86, ARM, Hexagon, PowerPC, RISC-V\n8:- Operating systems: Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Qualcomm QuRT\n9:- GPU Compute APIs: CUDA, OpenCL, OpenGL Compute Shaders, Apple Metal, Microsoft\n10:  Direct X 12\n11:\n12:Rather than being a standalone programming language, Halide is embedded in C++.\n13:This means you write C++ code that builds an in-memory representation of a\n14:Halide pipeline using Halide's C++ API. You can then compile this representation\n15:to an object file, or JIT-compile it and run it in the same process. Halide also\n16:provides a Python binding that provides full support for writing Halide embedded\n17:in Python without C++.\n18:\n19:Halide requires C++17 (or later) to use.\n20:\n21:For more detail about what Halide is, see http://halide-lang.org.\n22:\n23:For API documentation see http://halide-lang.org/docs\n24:\n25:To see some example code, look in the tutorials directory.\n26:\n27:If you've acquired a full source distribution and want to build Halide, see the\n28:[notes below](#building-halide-with-cmake).\n29:\n30:# Getting Halide\n31:\n32:## Binary tarballs\n33:\n34:The latest version of Halide can always be found on GitHub\n35:at https://github.com/halide/Halide/releases\n36:\n37:We provide binary releases for many popular platforms and architectures, \n38:including 32/64-bit x86 Windows, 64-bit macOS, and 32/64-bit x86/ARM\n39:Ubuntu Linux.\n40:\n41:## Vcpkg\n42:\n43:If you use [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to manage dependencies,\n44:you can install Halide via:\n45:\n46:```\n47:$ vcpkg install halide:x64-windows # or x64-linux/x64-osx\n48:```\n49:\n50:One caveat: vcpkg installs only the minimum Halide backends required to compile\n51:code for the active platform. If you want to include all the backends, you\n52:should install `halide[target-all]:x64-windows` instead. Note that since this\n53:will build LLVM, it will take a _lot_ of disk space (up to 100GB).\n54:\n55:## Homebrew\n56:\n57:Alternatively, if you use macOS, you can install Halide via\n58:[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) like so:\n59:\n60:```\n61:$ brew install halide\n62:```\n63:\n64:## Other package managers\n65:\n66:We are interested in bringing Halide to other popular package managers and\n67:Linux distribution repositories including, but not limited to, Conan,\n68:Debian, [Ubuntu (or PPA)](https://github.com/halide/Halide/issues/5285),\n69:CentOS/Fedora, and Arch. If you have experience publishing packages we would be\n70:happy to work with you!\n71:\n72:If you are a maintainer of any other package distribution platform, we would be\n73:excited to work with you, too.\n74:\n75:# Platform Support\n76:\n77:There are two sets of platform requirements relevant to Halide: those required\n78:to run the compiler library in either JIT or AOT mode, and those required to run\n79:the _binary outputs_ of the AOT compiler.\n80:\n81:These are the **tested** host toolchain and platform combinations for building\n82:and running the Halide compiler library.\n83:\n84:| Compiler   | Version      | OS                     | Architectures   |\n85:|------------|--------------|------------------------|-----------------|\n86:| GCC        | 7.5          | Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS | x86, x64, ARM32 |\n87:| GCC        | 7.5          | Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS | ARM32, ARM64    |\n88:| MSVC       | 2019 (19.28) | Windows 10 (20H2)      | x86, x64        |\n89:| AppleClang | 12.0.0       | macOS 10.15            | x86_64          |\n90:| AppleClang | 12.0.0       | macOS 11.1             | ARM64           |\n91:\n92:Some users have successfully built Halide for Linux using Clang 9.0.0+, for\n93:Windows using ClangCL 11.0.0+, and for Windows ARM64 by cross-compiling with\n94:MSVC. We do not actively test these scenarios, however, so your mileage may\n95:vary.\n96:\n97:Beyond these, we are willing to support (by accepting PRs for) platform and\n98:toolchain combinations that still receive _active, first-party, public support_\n99:from their original vendors. For instance, at time of writing, this excludes\n100:Windows 7 and includes Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.\n(346 more lines below)\n\n(Open file: /testbed/README.md)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- cmake\n- Ninja\nlanguage:\n  name: C++\n  version_constraint: C++17 or later\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: 'vcpkg install halide:x64-windows # or x64-linux/x64-osx'\n  name: vcpkg\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - clang\n  - lld\n  - clang-tools-extra\n  - libpng\n  - libjpeg-turbo\n  likely_required:\n  - llvm\n  - python3\n  - libc++\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed LLVM version was incompatible with project requirements\n    - Solution: The default LLVM package version (3.8) did not match the project's supported versions (3.9.1+). The root cause was a version mismatch in the package repository. The solution was to uninstall the incompatible version and install the specific required version (LLVM 3.9) using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get remove -y llvm llvm-dev && apt-get install -y llvm-3.9-dev\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Persistent build failures during make libs due to compiler/environment incompatibilities\n    - Solution: Source builds failed with lseek64 and std::max errors indicating toolchain mismatches. The root cause was unsupported configurations in Alpine 3.22. The solution was installing ponyc via ponyup to bypass source compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add curl && sh -c \"$(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponylang/ponyup/latest-release/ponyup-init.sh)\" && ponyup update ponyc release\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The build system failed to locate the LLVM configuration tool\n    - Solution: The build process required the LLVM_CONFIG environment variable to point to the llvm-config binary. The root cause was an unset environment variable after installing LLVM 3.9. The solution was to explicitly set LLVM_CONFIG to the correct binary path before building.\n    - Action: export LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/bin/llvm-config-3.9\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Conan version incompatibility with the project's conanfile.py\n    - Solution: The installed Conan version (2.x) used a different API than the project's conanfile.py expected (v1 syntax with 'from conans import...'). The root cause was API deprecation between Conan versions. The solution was to downgrade to a compatible Conan version (1.39.0).\n    - Action: pip uninstall -y conan && pip install conan==1.39.0\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The Python interpreter was not available, causing CMake configuration to fail when Python-dependent scripts were required\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Python, which was needed for test-related scripts and CMake configuration steps in the project. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Halide\n5:currently targets:\n6:\n7:- CPU architectures: X86, ARM, Hexagon, PowerPC, RISC-V\n8:- Operating systems: Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Qualcomm QuRT\n9:- GPU Compute APIs: CUDA, OpenCL, OpenGL Compute Shaders, Apple Metal, Microsoft\n10:  Direct X 12\n11:\n12:Rather than being a standalone programming language, Halide is embedded in C++.\n13:This means you write C++ code that builds an in-memory representation of a\n14:Halide pipeline using Halide's C++ API. You can then compile this representation\n15:to an object file, or JIT-compile it and run it in the same process. Halide also\n16:provides a Python binding that provides full support for writing Halide embedded\n17:in Python without C++.\n18:\n19:Halide requires C++17 (or later) to use.\n20:\n21:For more detail about what Halide is, see http://halide-lang.org.\n22:\n23:For API documentation see http://halide-lang.org/docs\n24:\n25:To see some example code, look in the tutorials directory.\n26:\n27:If you've acquired a full source distribution and want to build Halide, see the\n28:[notes below](#building-halide-with-cmake).\n29:\n30:# Getting Halide\n31:\n32:## Binary tarballs\n33:\n34:The latest version of Halide can always be found on GitHub\n35:at https://github.com/halide/Halide/releases\n36:\n37:We provide binary releases for many popular platforms and architectures, \n38:including 32/64-bit x86 Windows, 64-bit macOS, and 32/64-bit x86/ARM\n39:Ubuntu Linux.\n40:\n41:## Vcpkg\n42:\n43:If you use [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to manage dependencies,\n44:you can install Halide via:\n45:\n46:```\n47:$ vcpkg install halide:x64-windows # or x64-linux/x64-osx\n48:```\n49:\n50:One caveat: vcpkg installs only the minimum Halide backends required to compile\n51:code for the active platform. If you want to include all the backends, you\n52:should install `halide[target-all]:x64-windows` instead. Note that since this\n53:will build LLVM, it will take a _lot_ of disk space (up to 100GB).\n54:\n55:## Homebrew\n56:\n57:Alternatively, if you use macOS, you can install Halide via\n58:[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) like so:\n59:\n60:```\n61:$ brew install halide\n62:```\n63:\n64:## Other package managers\n65:\n66:We are interested in bringing Halide to other popular package managers and\n67:Linux distribution repositories including, but not limited to, Conan,\n68:Debian, [Ubuntu (or PPA)](https://github.com/halide/Halide/issues/5285),\n69:CentOS/Fedora, and Arch. If you have experience publishing packages we would be\n70:happy to work with you!\n71:\n72:If you are a maintainer of any other package distribution platform, we would be\n73:excited to work with you, too.\n74:\n75:# Platform Support\n76:\n77:There are two sets of platform requirements relevant to Halide: those required\n78:to run the compiler library in either JIT or AOT mode, and those required to run\n79:the _binary outputs_ of the AOT compiler.\n80:\n81:These are the **tested** host toolchain and platform combinations for building\n82:and running the Halide compiler library.\n83:\n84:| Compiler   | Version      | OS                     | Architectures   |\n85:|------------|--------------|------------------------|-----------------|\n86:| GCC        | 7.5          | Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS | x86, x64, ARM32 |\n87:| GCC        | 7.5          | Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS | ARM32, ARM64    |\n88:| MSVC       | 2019 (19.28) | Windows 10 (20H2)      | x86, x64        |\n89:| AppleClang | 12.0.0       | macOS 10.15            | x86_64          |\n90:| AppleClang | 12.0.0       | macOS 11.1             | ARM64           |\n91:\n92:Some users have successfully built Halide for Linux using Clang 9.0.0+, for\n93:Windows using ClangCL 11.0.0+, and for Windows ARM64 by cross-compiling with\n94:MSVC. We do not actively test these scenarios, however, so your mileage may\n95:vary.\n96:\n97:Beyond these, we are willing to support (by accepting PRs for) platform and\n98:toolchain combinations that still receive _active, first-party, public support_\n99:from their original vendors. For instance, at time of writing, this excludes\n100:Windows 7 and includes Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.\n(346 more lines below)\n\n(Open file: /testbed/README.md)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed LLVM version was incompatible with project requirements\n    - Solution: The default LLVM package version (3.8) did not match the project's supported versions (3.9.1+). The root cause was a version mismatch in the package repository. The solution was to uninstall the incompatible version and install the specific required version (LLVM 3.9) using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get remove -y llvm llvm-dev && apt-get install -y llvm-3.9-dev\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Persistent build failures during make libs due to compiler/environment incompatibilities\n    - Solution: Source builds failed with lseek64 and std::max errors indicating toolchain mismatches. The root cause was unsupported configurations in Alpine 3.22. The solution was installing ponyc via ponyup to bypass source compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add curl && sh -c \"$(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponylang/ponyup/latest-release/ponyup-init.sh)\" && ponyup update ponyc release\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The build system failed to locate the LLVM configuration tool\n    - Solution: The build process required the LLVM_CONFIG environment variable to point to the llvm-config binary. The root cause was an unset environment variable after installing LLVM 3.9. The solution was to explicitly set LLVM_CONFIG to the correct binary path before building.\n    - Action: export LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/bin/llvm-config-3.9\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Conan version incompatibility with the project's conanfile.py\n    - Solution: The installed Conan version (2.x) used a different API than the project's conanfile.py expected (v1 syntax with 'from conans import...'). The root cause was API deprecation between Conan versions. The solution was to downgrade to a compatible Conan version (1.39.0).\n    - Action: pip uninstall -y conan && pip install conan==1.39.0\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The Python interpreter was not available, causing CMake configuration to fail when Python-dependent scripts were required\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Python, which was needed for test-related scripts and CMake configuration steps in the project. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Halide\n5:currently targets:\n6:\n7:- CPU architectures: X86, ARM, Hexagon, PowerPC, RISC-V\n8:- Operating systems: Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Qualcomm QuRT\n9:- GPU Compute APIs: CUDA, OpenCL, OpenGL Compute Shaders, Apple Metal, Microsoft\n10:  Direct X 12\n11:\n12:Rather than being a standalone programming language, Halide is embedded in C++.\n13:This means you write C++ code that builds an in-memory representation of a\n14:Halide pipeline using Halide's C++ API. You can then compile this representation\n15:to an object file, or JIT-compile it and run it in the same process. Halide also\n16:provides a Python binding that provides full support for writing Halide embedded\n17:in Python without C++.\n18:\n19:Halide requires C++17 (or later) to use.\n20:\n21:For more detail about what Halide is, see http://halide-lang.org.\n22:\n23:For API documentation see http://halide-lang.org/docs\n24:\n25:To see some example code, look in the tutorials directory.\n26:\n27:If you've acquired a full source distribution and want to build Halide, see the\n28:[notes below](#building-halide-with-cmake).\n29:\n30:# Getting Halide\n31:\n32:## Binary tarballs\n33:\n34:The latest version of Halide can always be found on GitHub\n35:at https://github.com/halide/Halide/releases\n36:\n37:We provide binary releases for many popular platforms and architectures, \n38:including 32/64-bit x86 Windows, 64-bit macOS, and 32/64-bit x86/ARM\n39:Ubuntu Linux.\n40:\n41:## Vcpkg\n42:\n43:If you use [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to manage dependencies,\n44:you can install Halide via:\n45:\n46:```\n47:$ vcpkg install halide:x64-windows # or x64-linux/x64-osx\n48:```\n49:\n50:One caveat: vcpkg installs only the minimum Halide backends required to compile\n51:code for the active platform. If you want to include all the backends, you\n52:should install `halide[target-all]:x64-windows` instead. Note that since this\n53:will build LLVM, it will take a _lot_ of disk space (up to 100GB).\n54:\n55:## Homebrew\n56:\n57:Alternatively, if you use macOS, you can install Halide via\n58:[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) like so:\n59:\n60:```\n61:$ brew install halide\n62:```\n63:\n64:## Other package managers\n65:\n66:We are interested in bringing Halide to other popular package managers and\n67:Linux distribution repositories including, but not limited to, Conan,\n68:Debian, [Ubuntu (or PPA)](https://github.com/halide/Halide/issues/5285),\n69:CentOS/Fedora, and Arch. If you have experience publishing packages we would be\n70:happy to work with you!\n71:\n72:If you are a maintainer of any other package distribution platform, we would be\n73:excited to work with you, too.\n74:\n75:# Platform Support\n76:\n77:There are two sets of platform requirements relevant to Halide: those required\n78:to run the compiler library in either JIT or AOT mode, and those required to run\n79:the _binary outputs_ of the AOT compiler.\n80:\n81:These are the **tested** host toolchain and platform combinations for building\n82:and running the Halide compiler library.\n83:\n84:| Compiler   | Version      | OS                     | Architectures   |\n85:|------------|--------------|------------------------|-----------------|\n86:| GCC        | 7.5          | Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS | x86, x64, ARM32 |\n87:| GCC        | 7.5          | Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS | ARM32, ARM64    |\n88:| MSVC       | 2019 (19.28) | Windows 10 (20H2)      | x86, x64        |\n89:| AppleClang | 12.0.0       | macOS 10.15            | x86_64          |\n90:| AppleClang | 12.0.0       | macOS 11.1             | ARM64           |\n91:\n92:Some users have successfully built Halide for Linux using Clang 9.0.0+, for\n93:Windows using ClangCL 11.0.0+, and for Windows ARM64 by cross-compiling with\n94:MSVC. We do not actively test these scenarios, however, so your mileage may\n95:vary.\n96:\n97:Beyond these, we are willing to support (by accepting PRs for) platform and\n98:toolchain combinations that still receive _active, first-party, public support_\n99:from their original vendors. For instance, at time of writing, this excludes\n100:Windows 7 and includes Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.\n(346 more lines below)\n\n(Open file: /testbed/README.md)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- cmake\n- Ninja\nlanguage:\n  name: C++\n  version_constraint: C++17 or later\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: 'vcpkg install halide:x64-windows # or x64-linux/x64-osx'\n  name: vcpkg\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - clang\n  - lld\n  - clang-tools-extra\n  - libpng\n  - libjpeg-turbo\n  likely_required:\n  - llvm\n  - python3\n  - libc++\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed LLVM version was incompatible with project requirements\n    - Solution: The default LLVM package version (3.8) did not match the project's supported versions (3.9.1+). The root cause was a version mismatch in the package repository. The solution was to uninstall the incompatible version and install the specific required version (LLVM 3.9) using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get remove -y llvm llvm-dev && apt-get install -y llvm-3.9-dev\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Persistent build failures during make libs due to compiler/environment incompatibilities\n    - Solution: Source builds failed with lseek64 and std::max errors indicating toolchain mismatches. The root cause was unsupported configurations in Alpine 3.22. The solution was installing ponyc via ponyup to bypass source compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add curl && sh -c \"$(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponylang/ponyup/latest-release/ponyup-init.sh)\" && ponyup update ponyc release\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The build system failed to locate the LLVM configuration tool\n    - Solution: The build process required the LLVM_CONFIG environment variable to point to the llvm-config binary. The root cause was an unset environment variable after installing LLVM 3.9. The solution was to explicitly set LLVM_CONFIG to the correct binary path before building.\n    - Action: export LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/bin/llvm-config-3.9\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Conan version incompatibility with the project's conanfile.py\n    - Solution: The installed Conan version (2.x) used a different API than the project's conanfile.py expected (v1 syntax with 'from conans import...'). The root cause was API deprecation between Conan versions. The solution was to downgrade to a compatible Conan version (1.39.0).\n    - Action: pip uninstall -y conan && pip install conan==1.39.0\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The Python interpreter was not available, causing CMake configuration to fail when Python-dependent scripts were required\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Python, which was needed for test-related scripts and CMake configuration steps in the project. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- cmake\n- Ninja\nlanguage:\n  name: C++\n  version_constraint: C++17 or later\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: 'vcpkg install halide:x64-windows # or x64-linux/x64-osx'\n  name: vcpkg\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - clang\n  - lld\n  - clang-tools-extra\n  - libpng\n  - libjpeg-turbo\n  likely_required:\n  - llvm\n  - python3\n  - libc++\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed LLVM version was incompatible with project requirements\n    - Solution: The default LLVM package version (3.8) did not match the project's supported versions (3.9.1+). The root cause was a version mismatch in the package repository. The solution was to uninstall the incompatible version and install the specific required version (LLVM 3.9) using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get remove -y llvm llvm-dev && apt-get install -y llvm-3.9-dev\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Persistent build failures during make libs due to compiler/environment incompatibilities\n    - Solution: Source builds failed with lseek64 and std::max errors indicating toolchain mismatches. The root cause was unsupported configurations in Alpine 3.22. The solution was installing ponyc via ponyup to bypass source compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add curl && sh -c \"$(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponylang/ponyup/latest-release/ponyup-init.sh)\" && ponyup update ponyc release\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The build system failed to locate the LLVM configuration tool\n    - Solution: The build process required the LLVM_CONFIG environment variable to point to the llvm-config binary. The root cause was an unset environment variable after installing LLVM 3.9. The solution was to explicitly set LLVM_CONFIG to the correct binary path before building.\n    - Action: export LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/bin/llvm-config-3.9\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Conan version incompatibility with the project's conanfile.py\n    - Solution: The installed Conan version (2.x) used a different API than the project's conanfile.py expected (v1 syntax with 'from conans import...'). The root cause was API deprecation between Conan versions. The solution was to downgrade to a compatible Conan version (1.39.0).\n    - Action: pip uninstall -y conan && pip install conan==1.39.0\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The Python interpreter was not available, causing CMake configuration to fail when Python-dependent scripts were required\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Python, which was needed for test-related scripts and CMake configuration steps in the project. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed LLVM version was incompatible with project requirements\n    - Solution: The default LLVM package version (3.8) did not match the project's supported versions (3.9.1+). The root cause was a version mismatch in the package repository. The solution was to uninstall the incompatible version and install the specific required version (LLVM 3.9) using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get remove -y llvm llvm-dev && apt-get install -y llvm-3.9-dev\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Persistent build failures during make libs due to compiler/environment incompatibilities\n    - Solution: Source builds failed with lseek64 and std::max errors indicating toolchain mismatches. The root cause was unsupported configurations in Alpine 3.22. The solution was installing ponyc via ponyup to bypass source compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add curl && sh -c \"$(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponylang/ponyup/latest-release/ponyup-init.sh)\" && ponyup update ponyc release\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The build system failed to locate the LLVM configuration tool\n    - Solution: The build process required the LLVM_CONFIG environment variable to point to the llvm-config binary. The root cause was an unset environment variable after installing LLVM 3.9. The solution was to explicitly set LLVM_CONFIG to the correct binary path before building.\n    - Action: export LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/bin/llvm-config-3.9\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Conan version incompatibility with the project's conanfile.py\n    - Solution: The installed Conan version (2.x) used a different API than the project's conanfile.py expected (v1 syntax with 'from conans import...'). The root cause was API deprecation between Conan versions. The solution was to downgrade to a compatible Conan version (1.39.0).\n    - Action: pip uninstall -y conan && pip install conan==1.39.0\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The Python interpreter was not available, causing CMake configuration to fail when Python-dependent scripts were required\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Python, which was needed for test-related scripts and CMake configuration steps in the project. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

      "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- make\n- cmake\n- Ninja\nlanguage:\n  name: C++\n  version_constraint: C++17 or later\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: 'vcpkg install halide:x64-windows # or x64-linux/x64-osx'\n  name: vcpkg\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - clang\n  - lld\n  - clang-tools-extra\n  - libpng\n  - libjpeg-turbo\n  likely_required:\n  - llvm\n  - python3\n  - libc++\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: Building project dependencies failed due to C++ standard compatibility issues\n    - Solution: The root cause was compiler version incompatibility with the project's dependencies. The solution was to install and use an older GCC version (g++-9) that supported the required C++ standard.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++-9; make libs CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The system lacked essential build tools required for compiling C++ projects\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of build-essential (which includes compilers like g++), CMake, and Ninja on the Ubuntu system, as these tools are necessary for building projects that use CMake and Ninja build systems. The solution was to install these packages using the apt package manager to ensure the environment could compile and build the project successfully.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The installed LLVM version was incompatible with project requirements\n    - Solution: The default LLVM package version (3.8) did not match the project's supported versions (3.9.1+). The root cause was a version mismatch in the package repository. The solution was to uninstall the incompatible version and install the specific required version (LLVM 3.9) using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get remove -y llvm llvm-dev && apt-get install -y llvm-3.9-dev\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: CMake configuration failed due to missing LLVM development files\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of LLVM development packages required for building the project. The BUILD.md documentation specified LLVM as a dependency, but the system lacked the necessary headers and configuration files. Installing llvm-dev provided the missing components.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get -y install llvm-dev\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Essential build tools (clang, cmake, make) were missing in the Ubuntu environment.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of required compilers and build utilities needed to compile the project from source. The solution was to install these tools using the system package manager to meet the build dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang cmake make\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Persistent build failures during make libs due to compiler/environment incompatibilities\n    - Solution: Source builds failed with lseek64 and std::max errors indicating toolchain mismatches. The root cause was unsupported configurations in Alpine 3.22. The solution was installing ponyc via ponyup to bypass source compilation issues.\n    - Action: apk add curl && sh -c \"$(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponylang/ponyup/latest-release/ponyup-init.sh)\" && ponyup update ponyc release\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The build system failed to locate the LLVM configuration tool\n    - Solution: The build process required the LLVM_CONFIG environment variable to point to the llvm-config binary. The root cause was an unset environment variable after installing LLVM 3.9. The solution was to explicitly set LLVM_CONFIG to the correct binary path before building.\n    - Action: export LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/bin/llvm-config-3.9\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Build failure due to missing Python 3 dependency\n    - Solution: Python 3 is required for building LLVM in this project, and its absence caused the build to fail. The root cause was Python 3 not being installed in the environment. Installing Python 3 addressed the dependency requirement.\n    - Action: apk add python3\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Conan version incompatibility with the project's conanfile.py\n    - Solution: The installed Conan version (2.x) used a different API than the project's conanfile.py expected (v1 syntax with 'from conans import...'). The root cause was API deprecation between Conan versions. The solution was to downgrade to a compatible Conan version (1.39.0).\n    - Action: pip uninstall -y conan && pip install conan==1.39.0\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The C++ compiler was missing, preventing CMake from identifying a valid compiler during project configuration\n    - Solution: The root cause was the lack of a C++ compiler in the environment, which is essential for compiling C++ projects. The solution was to install the g++ package using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The Python interpreter was not available, causing CMake configuration to fail when Python-dependent scripts were required\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Python, which was needed for test-related scripts and CMake configuration steps in the project. The solution was to install Python 3 using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Required build tools (g++, cmake, make) were missing for project compilation\n    - Solution: The root cause was insufficient build dependencies as specified in the project documentation. The solution was to install the missing tools using the package manager to satisfy the build requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y g++ cmake make\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Halide\n5:currently targets:\n6:\n7:- CPU architectures: X86, ARM, Hexagon, PowerPC, RISC-V\n8:- Operating systems: Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Qualcomm QuRT\n9:- GPU Compute APIs: CUDA, OpenCL, OpenGL Compute Shaders, Apple Metal, Microsoft\n10:  Direct X 12\n11:\n12:Rather than being a standalone programming language, Halide is embedded in C++.\n13:This means you write C++ code that builds an in-memory representation of a\n14:Halide pipeline using Halide's C++ API. You can then compile this representation\n15:to an object file, or JIT-compile it and run it in the same process. Halide also\n16:provides a Python binding that provides full support for writing Halide embedded\n17:in Python without C++.\n18:\n19:Halide requires C++17 (or later) to use.\n20:\n21:For more detail about what Halide is, see http://halide-lang.org.\n22:\n23:For API documentation see http://halide-lang.org/docs\n24:\n25:To see some example code, look in the tutorials directory.\n26:\n27:If you've acquired a full source distribution and want to build Halide, see the\n28:[notes below](#building-halide-with-cmake).\n29:\n30:# Getting Halide\n31:\n32:## Binary tarballs\n33:\n34:The latest version of Halide can always be found on GitHub\n35:at https://github.com/halide/Halide/releases\n36:\n37:We provide binary releases for many popular platforms and architectures, \n38:including 32/64-bit x86 Windows, 64-bit macOS, and 32/64-bit x86/ARM\n39:Ubuntu Linux.\n40:\n41:## Vcpkg\n42:\n43:If you use [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to manage dependencies,\n44:you can install Halide via:\n45:\n46:```\n47:$ vcpkg install halide:x64-windows # or x64-linux/x64-osx\n48:```\n49:\n50:One caveat: vcpkg installs only the minimum Halide backends required to compile\n51:code for the active platform. If you want to include all the backends, you\n52:should install `halide[target-all]:x64-windows` instead. Note that since this\n53:will build LLVM, it will take a _lot_ of disk space (up to 100GB).\n54:\n55:## Homebrew\n56:\n57:Alternatively, if you use macOS, you can install Halide via\n58:[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) like so:\n59:\n60:```\n61:$ brew install halide\n62:```\n63:\n64:## Other package managers\n65:\n66:We are interested in bringing Halide to other popular package managers and\n67:Linux distribution repositories including, but not limited to, Conan,\n68:Debian, [Ubuntu (or PPA)](https://github.com/halide/Halide/issues/5285),\n69:CentOS/Fedora, and Arch. If you have experience publishing packages we would be\n70:happy to work with you!\n71:\n72:If you are a maintainer of any other package distribution platform, we would be\n73:excited to work with you, too.\n74:\n75:# Platform Support\n76:\n77:There are two sets of platform requirements relevant to Halide: those required\n78:to run the compiler library in either JIT or AOT mode, and those required to run\n79:the _binary outputs_ of the AOT compiler.\n80:\n81:These are the **tested** host toolchain and platform combinations for building\n82:and running the Halide compiler library.\n83:\n84:| Compiler   | Version      | OS                     | Architectures   |\n85:|------------|--------------|------------------------|-----------------|\n86:| GCC        | 7.5          | Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS | x86, x64, ARM32 |\n87:| GCC        | 7.5          | Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS | ARM32, ARM64    |\n88:| MSVC       | 2019 (19.28) | Windows 10 (20H2)      | x86, x64        |\n89:| AppleClang | 12.0.0       | macOS 10.15            | x86_64          |\n90:| AppleClang | 12.0.0       | macOS 11.1             | ARM64           |\n91:\n92:Some users have successfully built Halide for Linux using Clang 9.0.0+, for\n93:Windows using ClangCL 11.0.0+, and for Windows ARM64 by cross-compiling with\n94:MSVC. We do not actively test these scenarios, however, so your mileage may\n95:vary.\n96:\n97:Beyond these, we are willing to support (by accepting PRs for) platform and\n98:toolchain combinations that still receive _active, first-party, public support_\n99:from their original vendors. For instance, at time of writing, this excludes\n100:Windows 7 and includes Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.\n(346 more lines below)\n\n(Open file: /testbed/README.md)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\",\"instance_template\":\"We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\\n\\n{{repo_related_info}}\\n\\n{{cross_repo_knowledge}}\\n\\nTASK TIPS:\\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.\",\"next_step_template\":\"{{observation}}\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"next_step_no_output_template\":\"Your command ran successfully and did not produce any output.\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"strategy_template\":null,\"demonstration_template\":null,\"success_reflection_template\":\"You are an expert code assistant who just successfully repaired a software project in an automated programming session.
