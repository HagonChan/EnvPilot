          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '>=7.4'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nikic/php-parser\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - php\n  - composer\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency lock file incompatibility with the older toolchain\n    - Solution: The `Cargo.lock` file was generated by a newer version of Cargo and was incompatible with the older Rust toolchain (1.26.0). The root cause was a version mismatch in the lock file serialization format. The solution was to remove the lock file to allow Cargo to regenerate it with a compatible format for the toolchain.\n    - Action: rm -f Cargo.lock\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed when cloning a Git repository\n    - Solution: The Git protocol (git://) was blocked or unsupported in the environment, causing connection timeouts during repository cloning. The root cause was network configuration restrictions. The solution was to modify the dependency URL to use HTTPS protocol instead.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|git://github.com|https://github.com|g' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial apt-get update command failed due to missing HTTPS transport support\n    - Solution: The system lacked the apt-transport-https package required for accessing HTTPS repositories during package updates. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for secure repository access. The solution was to install apt-transport-https using apt-get install apt-transport-https, which enabled successful HTTPS connections for subsequent package operations.\n    - Action: apt-get install apt-transport-https\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The curl command was not available for downloading dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing essential network utilities in the Ubuntu environment. The solution was to install curl using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Dependency resolution selected incompatible libc version\n    - Solution: The root cause was Cargo selecting a libc crate version requiring Rust 2021 edition, incompatible with Rust 1.36.0. The solution was to explicitly pin libc to version 0.2.54 in Cargo.toml, satisfying dependency constraints while maintaining compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i '/byteorder = \"=1.0.0\"/a libc = \"=0.2.54\"' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case13**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Dependency resolution selected incompatible libc version\n    - Solution: The root cause was Cargo selecting a libc crate version requiring Rust 2021 edition, incompatible with Rust 1.36.0. The solution was to explicitly pin libc to version 0.2.54 in Cargo.toml, satisfying dependency constraints while maintaining compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i '/byteorder = \"=1.0.0\"/a libc = \"=0.2.54\"' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case13**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '>=7.4'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nikic/php-parser\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - php\n  - composer\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency lock file incompatibility with the older toolchain\n    - Solution: The `Cargo.lock` file was generated by a newer version of Cargo and was incompatible with the older Rust toolchain (1.26.0). The root cause was a version mismatch in the lock file serialization format. The solution was to remove the lock file to allow Cargo to regenerate it with a compatible format for the toolchain.\n    - Action: rm -f Cargo.lock\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed when cloning a Git repository\n    - Solution: The Git protocol (git://) was blocked or unsupported in the environment, causing connection timeouts during repository cloning. The root cause was network configuration restrictions. The solution was to modify the dependency URL to use HTTPS protocol instead.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|git://github.com|https://github.com|g' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial apt-get update command failed due to missing HTTPS transport support\n    - Solution: The system lacked the apt-transport-https package required for accessing HTTPS repositories during package updates. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for secure repository access. The solution was to install apt-transport-https using apt-get install apt-transport-https, which enabled successful HTTPS connections for subsequent package operations.\n    - Action: apt-get install apt-transport-https\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The curl command was not available for downloading dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing essential network utilities in the Ubuntu environment. The solution was to install curl using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Dependency resolution selected incompatible libc version\n    - Solution: The root cause was Cargo selecting a libc crate version requiring Rust 2021 edition, incompatible with Rust 1.36.0. The solution was to explicitly pin libc to version 0.2.54 in Cargo.toml, satisfying dependency constraints while maintaining compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i '/byteorder = \"=1.0.0\"/a libc = \"=0.2.54\"' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case13**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '>=7.4'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nikic/php-parser\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - php\n  - composer\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency lock file incompatibility with the older toolchain\n    - Solution: The `Cargo.lock` file was generated by a newer version of Cargo and was incompatible with the older Rust toolchain (1.26.0). The root cause was a version mismatch in the lock file serialization format. The solution was to remove the lock file to allow Cargo to regenerate it with a compatible format for the toolchain.\n    - Action: rm -f Cargo.lock\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed when cloning a Git repository\n    - Solution: The Git protocol (git://) was blocked or unsupported in the environment, causing connection timeouts during repository cloning. The root cause was network configuration restrictions. The solution was to modify the dependency URL to use HTTPS protocol instead.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|git://github.com|https://github.com|g' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial apt-get update command failed due to missing HTTPS transport support\n    - Solution: The system lacked the apt-transport-https package required for accessing HTTPS repositories during package updates. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for secure repository access. The solution was to install apt-transport-https using apt-get install apt-transport-https, which enabled successful HTTPS connections for subsequent package operations.\n    - Action: apt-get install apt-transport-https\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The curl command was not available for downloading dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing essential network utilities in the Ubuntu environment. The solution was to install curl using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Dependency resolution selected incompatible libc version\n    - Solution: The root cause was Cargo selecting a libc crate version requiring Rust 2021 edition, incompatible with Rust 1.36.0. The solution was to explicitly pin libc to version 0.2.54 in Cargo.toml, satisfying dependency constraints while maintaining compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i '/byteorder = \"=1.0.0\"/a libc = \"=0.2.54\"' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case13**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '>=7.4'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nikic/php-parser\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - php\n  - composer\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency lock file incompatibility with the older toolchain\n    - Solution: The `Cargo.lock` file was generated by a newer version of Cargo and was incompatible with the older Rust toolchain (1.26.0). The root cause was a version mismatch in the lock file serialization format. The solution was to remove the lock file to allow Cargo to regenerate it with a compatible format for the toolchain.\n    - Action: rm -f Cargo.lock\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed when cloning a Git repository\n    - Solution: The Git protocol (git://) was blocked or unsupported in the environment, causing connection timeouts during repository cloning. The root cause was network configuration restrictions. The solution was to modify the dependency URL to use HTTPS protocol instead.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|git://github.com|https://github.com|g' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial apt-get update command failed due to missing HTTPS transport support\n    - Solution: The system lacked the apt-transport-https package required for accessing HTTPS repositories during package updates. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for secure repository access. The solution was to install apt-transport-https using apt-get install apt-transport-https, which enabled successful HTTPS connections for subsequent package operations.\n    - Action: apt-get install apt-transport-https\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The curl command was not available for downloading dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing essential network utilities in the Ubuntu environment. The solution was to install curl using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Dependency resolution selected incompatible libc version\n    - Solution: The root cause was Cargo selecting a libc crate version requiring Rust 2021 edition, incompatible with Rust 1.36.0. The solution was to explicitly pin libc to version 0.2.54 in Cargo.toml, satisfying dependency constraints while maintaining compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i '/byteorder = \"=1.0.0\"/a libc = \"=0.2.54\"' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case13**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '>=7.4'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nikic/php-parser\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - php\n  - composer\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency lock file incompatibility with the older toolchain\n    - Solution: The `Cargo.lock` file was generated by a newer version of Cargo and was incompatible with the older Rust toolchain (1.26.0). The root cause was a version mismatch in the lock file serialization format. The solution was to remove the lock file to allow Cargo to regenerate it with a compatible format for the toolchain.\n    - Action: rm -f Cargo.lock\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed when cloning a Git repository\n    - Solution: The Git protocol (git://) was blocked or unsupported in the environment, causing connection timeouts during repository cloning. The root cause was network configuration restrictions. The solution was to modify the dependency URL to use HTTPS protocol instead.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|git://github.com|https://github.com|g' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial apt-get update command failed due to missing HTTPS transport support\n    - Solution: The system lacked the apt-transport-https package required for accessing HTTPS repositories during package updates. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for secure repository access. The solution was to install apt-transport-https using apt-get install apt-transport-https, which enabled successful HTTPS connections for subsequent package operations.\n    - Action: apt-get install apt-transport-https\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The curl command was not available for downloading dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing essential network utilities in the Ubuntu environment. The solution was to install curl using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Dependency resolution selected incompatible libc version\n    - Solution: The root cause was Cargo selecting a libc crate version requiring Rust 2021 edition, incompatible with Rust 1.36.0. The solution was to explicitly pin libc to version 0.2.54 in Cargo.toml, satisfying dependency constraints while maintaining compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i '/byteorder = \"=1.0.0\"/a libc = \"=0.2.54\"' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case13**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '>=7.4'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nikic/php-parser\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - php\n  - composer\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency lock file incompatibility with the older toolchain\n    - Solution: The `Cargo.lock` file was generated by a newer version of Cargo and was incompatible with the older Rust toolchain (1.26.0). The root cause was a version mismatch in the lock file serialization format. The solution was to remove the lock file to allow Cargo to regenerate it with a compatible format for the toolchain.\n    - Action: rm -f Cargo.lock\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed when cloning a Git repository\n    - Solution: The Git protocol (git://) was blocked or unsupported in the environment, causing connection timeouts during repository cloning. The root cause was network configuration restrictions. The solution was to modify the dependency URL to use HTTPS protocol instead.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|git://github.com|https://github.com|g' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial apt-get update command failed due to missing HTTPS transport support\n    - Solution: The system lacked the apt-transport-https package required for accessing HTTPS repositories during package updates. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for secure repository access. The solution was to install apt-transport-https using apt-get install apt-transport-https, which enabled successful HTTPS connections for subsequent package operations.\n    - Action: apt-get install apt-transport-https\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The curl command was not available for downloading dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing essential network utilities in the Ubuntu environment. The solution was to install curl using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Dependency resolution selected incompatible libc version\n    - Solution: The root cause was Cargo selecting a libc crate version requiring Rust 2021 edition, incompatible with Rust 1.36.0. The solution was to explicitly pin libc to version 0.2.54 in Cargo.toml, satisfying dependency constraints while maintaining compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i '/byteorder = \"=1.0.0\"/a libc = \"=0.2.54\"' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case13**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '>=7.4'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nikic/php-parser\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - php\n  - composer\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency lock file incompatibility with the older toolchain\n    - Solution: The `Cargo.lock` file was generated by a newer version of Cargo and was incompatible with the older Rust toolchain (1.26.0). The root cause was a version mismatch in the lock file serialization format. The solution was to remove the lock file to allow Cargo to regenerate it with a compatible format for the toolchain.\n    - Action: rm -f Cargo.lock\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed when cloning a Git repository\n    - Solution: The Git protocol (git://) was blocked or unsupported in the environment, causing connection timeouts during repository cloning. The root cause was network configuration restrictions. The solution was to modify the dependency URL to use HTTPS protocol instead.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|git://github.com|https://github.com|g' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial apt-get update command failed due to missing HTTPS transport support\n    - Solution: The system lacked the apt-transport-https package required for accessing HTTPS repositories during package updates. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for secure repository access. The solution was to install apt-transport-https using apt-get install apt-transport-https, which enabled successful HTTPS connections for subsequent package operations.\n    - Action: apt-get install apt-transport-https\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The curl command was not available for downloading dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing essential network utilities in the Ubuntu environment. The solution was to install curl using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Dependency resolution selected incompatible libc version\n    - Solution: The root cause was Cargo selecting a libc crate version requiring Rust 2021 edition, incompatible with Rust 1.36.0. The solution was to explicitly pin libc to version 0.2.54 in Cargo.toml, satisfying dependency constraints while maintaining compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i '/byteorder = \"=1.0.0\"/a libc = \"=0.2.54\"' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case13**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '>=7.4'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nikic/php-parser\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - php\n  - composer\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency lock file incompatibility with the older toolchain\n    - Solution: The `Cargo.lock` file was generated by a newer version of Cargo and was incompatible with the older Rust toolchain (1.26.0). The root cause was a version mismatch in the lock file serialization format. The solution was to remove the lock file to allow Cargo to regenerate it with a compatible format for the toolchain.\n    - Action: rm -f Cargo.lock\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed when cloning a Git repository\n    - Solution: The Git protocol (git://) was blocked or unsupported in the environment, causing connection timeouts during repository cloning. The root cause was network configuration restrictions. The solution was to modify the dependency URL to use HTTPS protocol instead.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|git://github.com|https://github.com|g' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial apt-get update command failed due to missing HTTPS transport support\n    - Solution: The system lacked the apt-transport-https package required for accessing HTTPS repositories during package updates. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for secure repository access. The solution was to install apt-transport-https using apt-get install apt-transport-https, which enabled successful HTTPS connections for subsequent package operations.\n    - Action: apt-get install apt-transport-https\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The curl command was not available for downloading dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing essential network utilities in the Ubuntu environment. The solution was to install curl using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Dependency resolution selected incompatible libc version\n    - Solution: The root cause was Cargo selecting a libc crate version requiring Rust 2021 edition, incompatible with Rust 1.36.0. The solution was to explicitly pin libc to version 0.2.54 in Cargo.toml, satisfying dependency constraints while maintaining compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i '/byteorder = \"=1.0.0\"/a libc = \"=0.2.54\"' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case13**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '>=7.4'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nikic/php-parser\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - php\n  - composer\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency lock file incompatibility with the older toolchain\n    - Solution: The `Cargo.lock` file was generated by a newer version of Cargo and was incompatible with the older Rust toolchain (1.26.0). The root cause was a version mismatch in the lock file serialization format. The solution was to remove the lock file to allow Cargo to regenerate it with a compatible format for the toolchain.\n    - Action: rm -f Cargo.lock\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed when cloning a Git repository\n    - Solution: The Git protocol (git://) was blocked or unsupported in the environment, causing connection timeouts during repository cloning. The root cause was network configuration restrictions. The solution was to modify the dependency URL to use HTTPS protocol instead.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|git://github.com|https://github.com|g' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial apt-get update command failed due to missing HTTPS transport support\n    - Solution: The system lacked the apt-transport-https package required for accessing HTTPS repositories during package updates. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for secure repository access. The solution was to install apt-transport-https using apt-get install apt-transport-https, which enabled successful HTTPS connections for subsequent package operations.\n    - Action: apt-get install apt-transport-https\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The curl command was not available for downloading dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing essential network utilities in the Ubuntu environment. The solution was to install curl using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Dependency resolution selected incompatible libc version\n    - Solution: The root cause was Cargo selecting a libc crate version requiring Rust 2021 edition, incompatible with Rust 1.36.0. The solution was to explicitly pin libc to version 0.2.54 in Cargo.toml, satisfying dependency constraints while maintaining compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i '/byteorder = \"=1.0.0\"/a libc = \"=0.2.54\"' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case13**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '>=7.4'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nikic/php-parser\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - php\n  - composer\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency lock file incompatibility with the older toolchain\n    - Solution: The `Cargo.lock` file was generated by a newer version of Cargo and was incompatible with the older Rust toolchain (1.26.0). The root cause was a version mismatch in the lock file serialization format. The solution was to remove the lock file to allow Cargo to regenerate it with a compatible format for the toolchain.\n    - Action: rm -f Cargo.lock\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed when cloning a Git repository\n    - Solution: The Git protocol (git://) was blocked or unsupported in the environment, causing connection timeouts during repository cloning. The root cause was network configuration restrictions. The solution was to modify the dependency URL to use HTTPS protocol instead.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|git://github.com|https://github.com|g' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial apt-get update command failed due to missing HTTPS transport support\n    - Solution: The system lacked the apt-transport-https package required for accessing HTTPS repositories during package updates. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for secure repository access. The solution was to install apt-transport-https using apt-get install apt-transport-https, which enabled successful HTTPS connections for subsequent package operations.\n    - Action: apt-get install apt-transport-https\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The curl command was not available for downloading dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing essential network utilities in the Ubuntu environment. The solution was to install curl using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Dependency resolution selected incompatible libc version\n    - Solution: The root cause was Cargo selecting a libc crate version requiring Rust 2021 edition, incompatible with Rust 1.36.0. The solution was to explicitly pin libc to version 0.2.54 in Cargo.toml, satisfying dependency constraints while maintaining compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i '/byteorder = \"=1.0.0\"/a libc = \"=0.2.54\"' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case13**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency lock file incompatibility with the older toolchain\n    - Solution: The `Cargo.lock` file was generated by a newer version of Cargo and was incompatible with the older Rust toolchain (1.26.0). The root cause was a version mismatch in the lock file serialization format. The solution was to remove the lock file to allow Cargo to regenerate it with a compatible format for the toolchain.\n    - Action: rm -f Cargo.lock\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed when cloning a Git repository\n    - Solution: The Git protocol (git://) was blocked or unsupported in the environment, causing connection timeouts during repository cloning. The root cause was network configuration restrictions. The solution was to modify the dependency URL to use HTTPS protocol instead.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|git://github.com|https://github.com|g' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial apt-get update command failed due to missing HTTPS transport support\n    - Solution: The system lacked the apt-transport-https package required for accessing HTTPS repositories during package updates. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for secure repository access. The solution was to install apt-transport-https using apt-get install apt-transport-https, which enabled successful HTTPS connections for subsequent package operations.\n    - Action: apt-get install apt-transport-https\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The curl command was not available for downloading dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing essential network utilities in the Ubuntu environment. The solution was to install curl using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Dependency resolution selected incompatible libc version\n    - Solution: The root cause was Cargo selecting a libc crate version requiring Rust 2021 edition, incompatible with Rust 1.36.0. The solution was to explicitly pin libc to version 0.2.54 in Cargo.toml, satisfying dependency constraints while maintaining compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i '/byteorder = \"=1.0.0\"/a libc = \"=0.2.54\"' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case13**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '>=7.4'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nikic/php-parser\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - php\n  - composer\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency lock file incompatibility with the older toolchain\n    - Solution: The `Cargo.lock` file was generated by a newer version of Cargo and was incompatible with the older Rust toolchain (1.26.0). The root cause was a version mismatch in the lock file serialization format. The solution was to remove the lock file to allow Cargo to regenerate it with a compatible format for the toolchain.\n    - Action: rm -f Cargo.lock\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed when cloning a Git repository\n    - Solution: The Git protocol (git://) was blocked or unsupported in the environment, causing connection timeouts during repository cloning. The root cause was network configuration restrictions. The solution was to modify the dependency URL to use HTTPS protocol instead.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|git://github.com|https://github.com|g' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial apt-get update command failed due to missing HTTPS transport support\n    - Solution: The system lacked the apt-transport-https package required for accessing HTTPS repositories during package updates. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for secure repository access. The solution was to install apt-transport-https using apt-get install apt-transport-https, which enabled successful HTTPS connections for subsequent package operations.\n    - Action: apt-get install apt-transport-https\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The curl command was not available for downloading dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing essential network utilities in the Ubuntu environment. The solution was to install curl using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Dependency resolution selected incompatible libc version\n    - Solution: The root cause was Cargo selecting a libc crate version requiring Rust 2021 edition, incompatible with Rust 1.36.0. The solution was to explicitly pin libc to version 0.2.54 in Cargo.toml, satisfying dependency constraints while maintaining compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i '/byteorder = \"=1.0.0\"/a libc = \"=0.2.54\"' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case13**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '>=7.4'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nikic/php-parser\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - php\n  - composer\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency lock file incompatibility with the older toolchain\n    - Solution: The `Cargo.lock` file was generated by a newer version of Cargo and was incompatible with the older Rust toolchain (1.26.0). The root cause was a version mismatch in the lock file serialization format. The solution was to remove the lock file to allow Cargo to regenerate it with a compatible format for the toolchain.\n    - Action: rm -f Cargo.lock\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed when cloning a Git repository\n    - Solution: The Git protocol (git://) was blocked or unsupported in the environment, causing connection timeouts during repository cloning. The root cause was network configuration restrictions. The solution was to modify the dependency URL to use HTTPS protocol instead.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|git://github.com|https://github.com|g' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial apt-get update command failed due to missing HTTPS transport support\n    - Solution: The system lacked the apt-transport-https package required for accessing HTTPS repositories during package updates. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for secure repository access. The solution was to install apt-transport-https using apt-get install apt-transport-https, which enabled successful HTTPS connections for subsequent package operations.\n    - Action: apt-get install apt-transport-https\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The curl command was not available for downloading dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing essential network utilities in the Ubuntu environment. The solution was to install curl using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Dependency resolution selected incompatible libc version\n    - Solution: The root cause was Cargo selecting a libc crate version requiring Rust 2021 edition, incompatible with Rust 1.36.0. The solution was to explicitly pin libc to version 0.2.54 in Cargo.toml, satisfying dependency constraints while maintaining compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i '/byteorder = \"=1.0.0\"/a libc = \"=0.2.54\"' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case13**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '>=7.4'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nikic/php-parser\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - php\n  - composer\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency lock file incompatibility with the older toolchain\n    - Solution: The `Cargo.lock` file was generated by a newer version of Cargo and was incompatible with the older Rust toolchain (1.26.0). The root cause was a version mismatch in the lock file serialization format. The solution was to remove the lock file to allow Cargo to regenerate it with a compatible format for the toolchain.\n    - Action: rm -f Cargo.lock\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed when cloning a Git repository\n    - Solution: The Git protocol (git://) was blocked or unsupported in the environment, causing connection timeouts during repository cloning. The root cause was network configuration restrictions. The solution was to modify the dependency URL to use HTTPS protocol instead.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|git://github.com|https://github.com|g' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial apt-get update command failed due to missing HTTPS transport support\n    - Solution: The system lacked the apt-transport-https package required for accessing HTTPS repositories during package updates. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for secure repository access. The solution was to install apt-transport-https using apt-get install apt-transport-https, which enabled successful HTTPS connections for subsequent package operations.\n    - Action: apt-get install apt-transport-https\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The curl command was not available for downloading dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing essential network utilities in the Ubuntu environment. The solution was to install curl using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Dependency resolution selected incompatible libc version\n    - Solution: The root cause was Cargo selecting a libc crate version requiring Rust 2021 edition, incompatible with Rust 1.36.0. The solution was to explicitly pin libc to version 0.2.54 in Cargo.toml, satisfying dependency constraints while maintaining compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i '/byteorder = \"=1.0.0\"/a libc = \"=0.2.54\"' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case13**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '>=7.4'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nikic/php-parser\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - php\n  - composer\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency lock file incompatibility with the older toolchain\n    - Solution: The `Cargo.lock` file was generated by a newer version of Cargo and was incompatible with the older Rust toolchain (1.26.0). The root cause was a version mismatch in the lock file serialization format. The solution was to remove the lock file to allow Cargo to regenerate it with a compatible format for the toolchain.\n    - Action: rm -f Cargo.lock\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed when cloning a Git repository\n    - Solution: The Git protocol (git://) was blocked or unsupported in the environment, causing connection timeouts during repository cloning. The root cause was network configuration restrictions. The solution was to modify the dependency URL to use HTTPS protocol instead.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|git://github.com|https://github.com|g' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial apt-get update command failed due to missing HTTPS transport support\n    - Solution: The system lacked the apt-transport-https package required for accessing HTTPS repositories during package updates. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for secure repository access. The solution was to install apt-transport-https using apt-get install apt-transport-https, which enabled successful HTTPS connections for subsequent package operations.\n    - Action: apt-get install apt-transport-https\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The curl command was not available for downloading dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing essential network utilities in the Ubuntu environment. The solution was to install curl using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Dependency resolution selected incompatible libc version\n    - Solution: The root cause was Cargo selecting a libc crate version requiring Rust 2021 edition, incompatible with Rust 1.36.0. The solution was to explicitly pin libc to version 0.2.54 in Cargo.toml, satisfying dependency constraints while maintaining compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i '/byteorder = \"=1.0.0\"/a libc = \"=0.2.54\"' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case13**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '>=7.4'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nikic/php-parser\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - php\n  - composer\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency lock file incompatibility with the older toolchain\n    - Solution: The `Cargo.lock` file was generated by a newer version of Cargo and was incompatible with the older Rust toolchain (1.26.0). The root cause was a version mismatch in the lock file serialization format. The solution was to remove the lock file to allow Cargo to regenerate it with a compatible format for the toolchain.\n    - Action: rm -f Cargo.lock\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed when cloning a Git repository\n    - Solution: The Git protocol (git://) was blocked or unsupported in the environment, causing connection timeouts during repository cloning. The root cause was network configuration restrictions. The solution was to modify the dependency URL to use HTTPS protocol instead.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|git://github.com|https://github.com|g' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial apt-get update command failed due to missing HTTPS transport support\n    - Solution: The system lacked the apt-transport-https package required for accessing HTTPS repositories during package updates. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for secure repository access. The solution was to install apt-transport-https using apt-get install apt-transport-https, which enabled successful HTTPS connections for subsequent package operations.\n    - Action: apt-get install apt-transport-https\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The curl command was not available for downloading dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing essential network utilities in the Ubuntu environment. The solution was to install curl using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Dependency resolution selected incompatible libc version\n    - Solution: The root cause was Cargo selecting a libc crate version requiring Rust 2021 edition, incompatible with Rust 1.36.0. The solution was to explicitly pin libc to version 0.2.54 in Cargo.toml, satisfying dependency constraints while maintaining compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i '/byteorder = \"=1.0.0\"/a libc = \"=0.2.54\"' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case13**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '>=7.4'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nikic/php-parser\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - php\n  - composer\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency lock file incompatibility with the older toolchain\n    - Solution: The `Cargo.lock` file was generated by a newer version of Cargo and was incompatible with the older Rust toolchain (1.26.0). The root cause was a version mismatch in the lock file serialization format. The solution was to remove the lock file to allow Cargo to regenerate it with a compatible format for the toolchain.\n    - Action: rm -f Cargo.lock\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed when cloning a Git repository\n    - Solution: The Git protocol (git://) was blocked or unsupported in the environment, causing connection timeouts during repository cloning. The root cause was network configuration restrictions. The solution was to modify the dependency URL to use HTTPS protocol instead.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|git://github.com|https://github.com|g' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial apt-get update command failed due to missing HTTPS transport support\n    - Solution: The system lacked the apt-transport-https package required for accessing HTTPS repositories during package updates. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for secure repository access. The solution was to install apt-transport-https using apt-get install apt-transport-https, which enabled successful HTTPS connections for subsequent package operations.\n    - Action: apt-get install apt-transport-https\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The curl command was not available for downloading dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing essential network utilities in the Ubuntu environment. The solution was to install curl using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Dependency resolution selected incompatible libc version\n    - Solution: The root cause was Cargo selecting a libc crate version requiring Rust 2021 edition, incompatible with Rust 1.36.0. The solution was to explicitly pin libc to version 0.2.54 in Cargo.toml, satisfying dependency constraints while maintaining compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i '/byteorder = \"=1.0.0\"/a libc = \"=0.2.54\"' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case13**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '>=7.4'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nikic/php-parser\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - php\n  - composer\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency lock file incompatibility with the older toolchain\n    - Solution: The `Cargo.lock` file was generated by a newer version of Cargo and was incompatible with the older Rust toolchain (1.26.0). The root cause was a version mismatch in the lock file serialization format. The solution was to remove the lock file to allow Cargo to regenerate it with a compatible format for the toolchain.\n    - Action: rm -f Cargo.lock\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed when cloning a Git repository\n    - Solution: The Git protocol (git://) was blocked or unsupported in the environment, causing connection timeouts during repository cloning. The root cause was network configuration restrictions. The solution was to modify the dependency URL to use HTTPS protocol instead.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|git://github.com|https://github.com|g' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial apt-get update command failed due to missing HTTPS transport support\n    - Solution: The system lacked the apt-transport-https package required for accessing HTTPS repositories during package updates. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for secure repository access. The solution was to install apt-transport-https using apt-get install apt-transport-https, which enabled successful HTTPS connections for subsequent package operations.\n    - Action: apt-get install apt-transport-https\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The curl command was not available for downloading dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing essential network utilities in the Ubuntu environment. The solution was to install curl using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Dependency resolution selected incompatible libc version\n    - Solution: The root cause was Cargo selecting a libc crate version requiring Rust 2021 edition, incompatible with Rust 1.36.0. The solution was to explicitly pin libc to version 0.2.54 in Cargo.toml, satisfying dependency constraints while maintaining compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i '/byteorder = \"=1.0.0\"/a libc = \"=0.2.54\"' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case13**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '>=7.4'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nikic/php-parser\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - php\n  - composer\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency lock file incompatibility with the older toolchain\n    - Solution: The `Cargo.lock` file was generated by a newer version of Cargo and was incompatible with the older Rust toolchain (1.26.0). The root cause was a version mismatch in the lock file serialization format. The solution was to remove the lock file to allow Cargo to regenerate it with a compatible format for the toolchain.\n    - Action: rm -f Cargo.lock\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed when cloning a Git repository\n    - Solution: The Git protocol (git://) was blocked or unsupported in the environment, causing connection timeouts during repository cloning. The root cause was network configuration restrictions. The solution was to modify the dependency URL to use HTTPS protocol instead.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|git://github.com|https://github.com|g' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial apt-get update command failed due to missing HTTPS transport support\n    - Solution: The system lacked the apt-transport-https package required for accessing HTTPS repositories during package updates. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for secure repository access. The solution was to install apt-transport-https using apt-get install apt-transport-https, which enabled successful HTTPS connections for subsequent package operations.\n    - Action: apt-get install apt-transport-https\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The curl command was not available for downloading dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing essential network utilities in the Ubuntu environment. The solution was to install curl using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Dependency resolution selected incompatible libc version\n    - Solution: The root cause was Cargo selecting a libc crate version requiring Rust 2021 edition, incompatible with Rust 1.36.0. The solution was to explicitly pin libc to version 0.2.54 in Cargo.toml, satisfying dependency constraints while maintaining compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i '/byteorder = \"=1.0.0\"/a libc = \"=0.2.54\"' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case13**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

      "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: '>=7.4'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nikic/php-parser\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - php\n  - composer\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The initial attempt to install dependencies using apt-get failed due to unsupported package manager on Alpine Linux\n    - Solution: The Alpine Linux distribution uses apk instead of apt-get or yum for package management. The root cause was incorrect package manager selection for the environment. The solution was to identify the OS via /etc/os-release and use apk for dependency installation.\n    - Action: apk add cmake g++ make\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The required Rust toolchain version 1.70.0 was not installed in the Ubuntu environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the specified Rust version needed to build and test the Rust project. The solution involved automatically installing the missing toolchain through rustup when executing 'cargo test', as triggered by the project's rust-toolchain.toml configuration. This resolved the environment gap by fetching and installing components including cargo, rustc, and dependencies.\n    - Action: cargo test\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency lock file incompatibility with the older toolchain\n    - Solution: The `Cargo.lock` file was generated by a newer version of Cargo and was incompatible with the older Rust toolchain (1.26.0). The root cause was a version mismatch in the lock file serialization format. The solution was to remove the lock file to allow Cargo to regenerate it with a compatible format for the toolchain.\n    - Action: rm -f Cargo.lock\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Multiple Python dependencies required for testing were missing in the environment\n    - Solution: The root cause was incomplete installation of test-specific dependencies. The solution was to install all required packages (six, mock, webtest, nose) with version constraints matching the project's requirements.\n    - Action: pip install 'six>=1.10.0,<=1.14.0' && pip install 'mock>=1.3.0,<1.4.0' && pip install 'webtest>=2.0.18,<2.1.0' 'nose>=1.3.7,<1.4.0'\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed when cloning a Git repository\n    - Solution: The Git protocol (git://) was blocked or unsupported in the environment, causing connection timeouts during repository cloning. The root cause was network configuration restrictions. The solution was to modify the dependency URL to use HTTPS protocol instead.\n    - Action: sed -i 's|git://github.com|https://github.com|g' requirements/dev.txt\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The initial apt-get update command failed due to missing HTTPS transport support\n    - Solution: The system lacked the apt-transport-https package required for accessing HTTPS repositories during package updates. The root cause was an incomplete base environment configuration for secure repository access. The solution was to install apt-transport-https using apt-get install apt-transport-https, which enabled successful HTTPS connections for subsequent package operations.\n    - Action: apt-get install apt-transport-https\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Python was required but not installed for building and running project tests\n    - Solution: The project's CMake configuration explicitly required Python for test execution, but it was absent in the environment. The root cause was a missing runtime dependency specified in the build system. The solution was to install Python 3 using the package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The curl command was not available for downloading dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing essential network utilities in the Ubuntu environment. The solution was to install curl using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: The required package manager pnpm was not installed on the system, preventing dependency installation for projects using it.\n    - Solution: The root cause was that pnpm, essential for managing dependencies in monorepo or pnpm-based projects, was missing from the Ubuntu environment configuration. The solution involved updating the local package index to ensure access to the latest packages, installing curl to fetch the pnpm installation script, and then executing the official pnpm install script to set up pnpm and configure the PATH.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Dependency resolution selected incompatible libc version\n    - Solution: The root cause was Cargo selecting a libc crate version requiring Rust 2021 edition, incompatible with Rust 1.36.0. The solution was to explicitly pin libc to version 0.2.54 in Cargo.toml, satisfying dependency constraints while maintaining compatibility.\n    - Action: sed -i '/byteorder = \"=1.0.0\"/a libc = \"=0.2.54\"' Cargo.toml\n\n**Case13**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\",\"instance_template\":\"We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\\n\\n{{repo_related_info}}\\n\\n{{cross_repo_knowledge}}\\n\\nTASK TIPS:\\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them.
