The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 using the apt package manager after ensuring the system package index was updated.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Java runtime not installed, causing Maven build failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) in the environment, which is required for compiling and running Java projects. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 using the system package manager, providing the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Java and Maven were not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The build required Java and Maven to compile and run the Maven-based project. The root cause was the absence of these development tools in the environment configuration. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 JDK and Maven using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk maven\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was not installed on the system, causing the 'mvn' command to be unavailable for building the Java project.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Maven in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the unavailability of the build tool.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Maven dependency resolution failure during project build\n    - Solution: The build failed because the required artifact 'org.apache.dubbo:dubbo-build-tools:jar:1.0.0' was unavailable in the Maven central repository. The root cause was missing project dependencies in the local environment. The solution was to install all dependencies locally using the Maven install goal with tests skipped.\n    - Action: ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -Dstyle.color=never\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed during editable mode build due to missing Java dependency\n    - Solution: The build process required Java to run ANTLR for parser generation, but the Java Runtime Environment was not installed. The root cause was a missing build dependency in the environment configuration. The solution was to install the default JRE using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jre\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was missing, causing test failures during project execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Maven package in the environment. Maven is required for running certain integration tests in the project, specifically for the jib-maven-plugin module. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the command not found errors and allowed tests to pass.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A build plugin required a newer Java version than was installed.\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incompatible Java version (11) for a plugin requiring Java 17. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 to meet the dependency requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed Java version is incompatible with the project's build tool.\n    - Solution: The Gradle wrapper version was outdated and incompatible with the newer Java version (e.g., Java 21), causing build failures. The root cause was a version mismatch between the Java runtime and the build tool. The solution was to install an older, compatible Java version (OpenJDK 11).\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The Maven wrapper script failed due to a missing required JAR file\n    - Solution: The Maven wrapper requires maven-wrapper.jar to function, which was missing from the project's .mvn/wrapper directory. The root cause was an incomplete wrapper setup in the environment. The solution was to download the JAR from Maven Central using Python's urllib module, as standard download tools were unavailable.\n    - Action: python3 -c \"import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlretrieve('https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/wrapper/maven-wrapper/3.3.1/maven-wrapper-3.3.1.jar', '.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar')\"\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Java was not installed, causing the java command to fail\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running Java-based applications like Logstash. The solution was to install OpenJDK 11 using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: The mvn command was not found when checking the Maven installation\n    - Solution: The Maven build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is critical for compiling and testing Maven-based projects. The root cause was a missing build tool dependency in the environment setup. The solution was to install Maven via the apt package manager, enabling project builds and test execution.\n    - Action: apt install -y maven\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The root cause was the absence of these development tools in the environment configuration. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 JDK and Maven using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk maven\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was not installed on the system, causing the 'mvn' command to be unavailable for building the Java project.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Maven in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the unavailability of the build tool.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Maven dependency resolution failure during project build\n    - Solution: The build failed because the required artifact 'org.apache.dubbo:dubbo-build-tools:jar:1.0.0' was unavailable in the Maven central repository. The root cause was missing project dependencies in the local environment. The solution was to install all dependencies locally using the Maven install goal with tests skipped.\n    - Action: ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -Dstyle.color=never\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed during editable mode build due to missing Java dependency\n    - Solution: The build process required Java to run ANTLR for parser generation, but the Java Runtime Environment was not installed. The root cause was a missing build dependency in the environment configuration. The solution was to install the default JRE using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jre\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was missing, causing test failures during project execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Maven package in the environment. Maven is required for running certain integration tests in the project, specifically for the jib-maven-plugin module. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the command not found errors and allowed tests to pass.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A build plugin required a newer Java version than was installed.\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incompatible Java version (11) for a plugin requiring Java 17. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 to meet the dependency requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed Java version is incompatible with the project's build tool.\n    - Solution: The Gradle wrapper version was outdated and incompatible with the newer Java version (e.g., Java 21), causing build failures. The root cause was a version mismatch between the Java runtime and the build tool. The solution was to install an older, compatible Java version (OpenJDK 11).\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The Maven wrapper script failed due to a missing required JAR file\n    - Solution: The Maven wrapper requires maven-wrapper.jar to function, which was missing from the project's .mvn/wrapper directory. The root cause was an incomplete wrapper setup in the environment. The solution was to download the JAR from Maven Central using Python's urllib module, as standard download tools were unavailable.\n    - Action: python3 -c \"import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlretrieve('https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/wrapper/maven-wrapper/3.3.1/maven-wrapper-3.3.1.jar', '.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar')\"\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Java was not installed, causing the java command to fail\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running Java-based applications like Logstash. The solution was to install OpenJDK 11 using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: The mvn command was not found when checking the Maven installation\n    - Solution: The Maven build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is critical for compiling and testing Maven-based projects. The root cause was a missing build tool dependency in the environment setup. The solution was to install Maven via the apt package manager, enabling project builds and test execution.\n    - Action: apt install -y maven\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own.

The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the unavailability of the build tool.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Maven dependency resolution failure during project build\n    - Solution: The build failed because the required artifact 'org.apache.dubbo:dubbo-build-tools:jar:1.0.0' was unavailable in the Maven central repository. The root cause was missing project dependencies in the local environment. The solution was to install all dependencies locally using the Maven install goal with tests skipped.\n    - Action: ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -Dstyle.color=never\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed during editable mode build due to missing Java dependency\n    - Solution: The build process required Java to run ANTLR for parser generation, but the Java Runtime Environment was not installed. The root cause was a missing build dependency in the environment configuration. The solution was to install the default JRE using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jre\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was missing, causing test failures during project execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Maven package in the environment. Maven is required for running certain integration tests in the project, specifically for the jib-maven-plugin module. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the command not found errors and allowed tests to pass.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A build plugin required a newer Java version than was installed.\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incompatible Java version (11) for a plugin requiring Java 17. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 to meet the dependency requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed Java version is incompatible with the project's build tool.\n    - Solution: The Gradle wrapper version was outdated and incompatible with the newer Java version (e.g., Java 21), causing build failures. The root cause was a version mismatch between the Java runtime and the build tool. The solution was to install an older, compatible Java version (OpenJDK 11).\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The Maven wrapper script failed due to a missing required JAR file\n    - Solution: The Maven wrapper requires maven-wrapper.jar to function, which was missing from the project's .mvn/wrapper directory. The root cause was an incomplete wrapper setup in the environment. The solution was to download the JAR from Maven Central using Python's urllib module, as standard download tools were unavailable.\n    - Action: python3 -c \"import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlretrieve('https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/wrapper/maven-wrapper/3.3.1/maven-wrapper-3.3.1.jar', '.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar')\"\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Java was not installed, causing the java command to fail\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running Java-based applications like Logstash. The solution was to install OpenJDK 11 using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: The mvn command was not found when checking the Maven installation\n    - Solution: The Maven build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is critical for compiling and testing Maven-based projects. The root cause was a missing build tool dependency in the environment setup. The solution was to install Maven via the apt package manager, enabling project builds and test execution.\n    - Action: apt install -y maven\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- Maven\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: '>=8'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: pom.xml\n  install_command: mvn clean verify\n  name: Maven\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - temurin\n  - graalvm\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Java runtime was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and running Java-based projects. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 using the apt package manager after ensuring the system package index was updated.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Java runtime not installed, causing Maven build failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) in the environment, which is required for compiling and running Java projects. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 using the system package manager, providing the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Java and Maven were not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The build required Java and Maven to compile and run the Maven-based project. The root cause was the absence of these development tools in the environment configuration. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 JDK and Maven using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk maven\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was not installed on the system, causing the 'mvn' command to be unavailable for building the Java project.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Maven in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the unavailability of the build tool.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Maven dependency resolution failure during project build\n    - Solution: The build failed because the required artifact 'org.apache.dubbo:dubbo-build-tools:jar:1.0.0' was unavailable in the Maven central repository. The root cause was missing project dependencies in the local environment. The solution was to install all dependencies locally using the Maven install goal with tests skipped.\n    - Action: ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -Dstyle.color=never\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed during editable mode build due to missing Java dependency\n    - Solution: The build process required Java to run ANTLR for parser generation, but the Java Runtime Environment was not installed. The root cause was a missing build dependency in the environment configuration. The solution was to install the default JRE using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jre\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was missing, causing test failures during project execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Maven package in the environment. Maven is required for running certain integration tests in the project, specifically for the jib-maven-plugin module. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the command not found errors and allowed tests to pass.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A build plugin required a newer Java version than was installed.\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incompatible Java version (11) for a plugin requiring Java 17. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 to meet the dependency requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed Java version is incompatible with the project's build tool.\n    - Solution: The Gradle wrapper version was outdated and incompatible with the newer Java version (e.g., Java 21), causing build failures. The root cause was a version mismatch between the Java runtime and the build tool. The solution was to install an older, compatible Java version (OpenJDK 11).\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The Maven wrapper script failed due to a missing required JAR file\n    - Solution: The Maven wrapper requires maven-wrapper.jar to function, which was missing from the project's .mvn/wrapper directory. The root cause was an incomplete wrapper setup in the environment. The solution was to download the JAR from Maven Central using Python's urllib module, as standard download tools were unavailable.\n    - Action: python3 -c \"import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlretrieve('https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/wrapper/maven-wrapper/3.3.1/maven-wrapper-3.3.1.jar', '.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar')\"\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Java was not installed, causing the java command to fail\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running Java-based applications like Logstash. The solution was to install OpenJDK 11 using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: The mvn command was not found when checking the Maven installation\n    - Solution: The Maven build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is critical for compiling and testing Maven-based projects. The root cause was a missing build tool dependency in the environment setup. The solution was to install Maven via the apt package manager, enabling project builds and test execution.\n    - Action: apt install -y maven\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- Maven\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: '>=8'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: pom.xml\n  install_command: mvn clean verify\n  name: Maven\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - temurin\n  - graalvm\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Java runtime was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and running Java-based projects. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 using the apt package manager after ensuring the system package index was updated.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Java runtime not installed, causing Maven build failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) in the environment, which is required for compiling and running Java projects. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 using the system package manager, providing the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Java and Maven were not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The build required Java and Maven to compile and run the Maven-based project. The root cause was the absence of these development tools in the environment configuration. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 JDK and Maven using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk maven\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was not installed on the system, causing the 'mvn' command to be unavailable for building the Java project.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Maven in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the unavailability of the build tool.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Maven dependency resolution failure during project build\n    - Solution: The build failed because the required artifact 'org.apache.dubbo:dubbo-build-tools:jar:1.0.0' was unavailable in the Maven central repository. The root cause was missing project dependencies in the local environment. The solution was to install all dependencies locally using the Maven install goal with tests skipped.\n    - Action: ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -Dstyle.color=never\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed during editable mode build due to missing Java dependency\n    - Solution: The build process required Java to run ANTLR for parser generation, but the Java Runtime Environment was not installed. The root cause was a missing build dependency in the environment configuration. The solution was to install the default JRE using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jre\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was missing, causing test failures during project execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Maven package in the environment. Maven is required for running certain integration tests in the project, specifically for the jib-maven-plugin module. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the command not found errors and allowed tests to pass.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A build plugin required a newer Java version than was installed.\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incompatible Java version (11) for a plugin requiring Java 17. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 to meet the dependency requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed Java version is incompatible with the project's build tool.\n    - Solution: The Gradle wrapper version was outdated and incompatible with the newer Java version (e.g., Java 21), causing build failures. The root cause was a version mismatch between the Java runtime and the build tool. The solution was to install an older, compatible Java version (OpenJDK 11).\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The Maven wrapper script failed due to a missing required JAR file\n    - Solution: The Maven wrapper requires maven-wrapper.jar to function, which was missing from the project's .mvn/wrapper directory. The root cause was an incomplete wrapper setup in the environment. The solution was to download the JAR from Maven Central using Python's urllib module, as standard download tools were unavailable.\n    - Action: python3 -c \"import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlretrieve('https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/wrapper/maven-wrapper/3.3.1/maven-wrapper-3.3.1.jar', '.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar')\"\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Java was not installed, causing the java command to fail\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running Java-based applications like Logstash. The solution was to install OpenJDK 11 using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: The mvn command was not found when checking the Maven installation\n    - Solution: The Maven build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is critical for compiling and testing Maven-based projects. The root cause was a missing build tool dependency in the environment setup. The solution was to install Maven via the apt package manager, enabling project builds and test execution.\n    - Action: apt install -y maven\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- Maven\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: '>=8'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: pom.xml\n  install_command: mvn clean verify\n  name: Maven\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - temurin\n  - graalvm\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Java runtime was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and running Java-based projects. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 using the apt package manager after ensuring the system package index was updated.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Java runtime not installed, causing Maven build failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) in the environment, which is required for compiling and running Java projects. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 using the system package manager, providing the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Java and Maven were not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The build required Java and Maven to compile and run the Maven-based project. The root cause was the absence of these development tools in the environment configuration. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 JDK and Maven using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk maven\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was not installed on the system, causing the 'mvn' command to be unavailable for building the Java project.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Maven in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the unavailability of the build tool.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Maven dependency resolution failure during project build\n    - Solution: The build failed because the required artifact 'org.apache.dubbo:dubbo-build-tools:jar:1.0.0' was unavailable in the Maven central repository. The root cause was missing project dependencies in the local environment. The solution was to install all dependencies locally using the Maven install goal with tests skipped.\n    - Action: ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -Dstyle.color=never\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed during editable mode build due to missing Java dependency\n    - Solution: The build process required Java to run ANTLR for parser generation, but the Java Runtime Environment was not installed. The root cause was a missing build dependency in the environment configuration. The solution was to install the default JRE using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jre\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was missing, causing test failures during project execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Maven package in the environment. Maven is required for running certain integration tests in the project, specifically for the jib-maven-plugin module. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the command not found errors and allowed tests to pass.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A build plugin required a newer Java version than was installed.\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incompatible Java version (11) for a plugin requiring Java 17. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 to meet the dependency requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed Java version is incompatible with the project's build tool.\n    - Solution: The Gradle wrapper version was outdated and incompatible with the newer Java version (e.g., Java 21), causing build failures. The root cause was a version mismatch between the Java runtime and the build tool. The solution was to install an older, compatible Java version (OpenJDK 11).\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The Maven wrapper script failed due to a missing required JAR file\n    - Solution: The Maven wrapper requires maven-wrapper.jar to function, which was missing from the project's .mvn/wrapper directory. The root cause was an incomplete wrapper setup in the environment. The solution was to download the JAR from Maven Central using Python's urllib module, as standard download tools were unavailable.\n    - Action: python3 -c \"import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlretrieve('https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/wrapper/maven-wrapper/3.3.1/maven-wrapper-3.3.1.jar', '.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar')\"\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Java was not installed, causing the java command to fail\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running Java-based applications like Logstash. The solution was to install OpenJDK 11 using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: The mvn command was not found when checking the Maven installation\n    - Solution: The Maven build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is critical for compiling and testing Maven-based projects. The root cause was a missing build tool dependency in the environment setup. The solution was to install Maven via the apt package manager, enabling project builds and test execution.\n    - Action: apt install -y maven\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- Maven\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: '>=8'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: pom.xml\n  install_command: mvn clean verify\n  name: Maven\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - temurin\n  - graalvm\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Java runtime was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and running Java-based projects. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 using the apt package manager after ensuring the system package index was updated.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Java runtime not installed, causing Maven build failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) in the environment, which is required for compiling and running Java projects. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 using the system package manager, providing the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Java and Maven were not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The build required Java and Maven to compile and run the Maven-based project. The root cause was the absence of these development tools in the environment configuration. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 JDK and Maven using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk maven\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was not installed on the system, causing the 'mvn' command to be unavailable for building the Java project.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Maven in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the unavailability of the build tool.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Maven dependency resolution failure during project build\n    - Solution: The build failed because the required artifact 'org.apache.dubbo:dubbo-build-tools:jar:1.0.0' was unavailable in the Maven central repository. The root cause was missing project dependencies in the local environment. The solution was to install all dependencies locally using the Maven install goal with tests skipped.\n    - Action: ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -Dstyle.color=never\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed during editable mode build due to missing Java dependency\n    - Solution: The build process required Java to run ANTLR for parser generation, but the Java Runtime Environment was not installed. The root cause was a missing build dependency in the environment configuration. The solution was to install the default JRE using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jre\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was missing, causing test failures during project execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Maven package in the environment. Maven is required for running certain integration tests in the project, specifically for the jib-maven-plugin module. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the command not found errors and allowed tests to pass.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A build plugin required a newer Java version than was installed.\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incompatible Java version (11) for a plugin requiring Java 17. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 to meet the dependency requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed Java version is incompatible with the project's build tool.\n    - Solution: The Gradle wrapper version was outdated and incompatible with the newer Java version (e.g., Java 21), causing build failures. The root cause was a version mismatch between the Java runtime and the build tool. The solution was to install an older, compatible Java version (OpenJDK 11).\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The Maven wrapper script failed due to a missing required JAR file\n    - Solution: The Maven wrapper requires maven-wrapper.jar to function, which was missing from the project's .mvn/wrapper directory. The root cause was an incomplete wrapper setup in the environment. The solution was to download the JAR from Maven Central using Python's urllib module, as standard download tools were unavailable.\n    - Action: python3 -c \"import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlretrieve('https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/wrapper/maven-wrapper/3.3.1/maven-wrapper-3.3.1.jar', '.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar')\"\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Java was not installed, causing the java command to fail\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running Java-based applications like Logstash. The solution was to install OpenJDK 11 using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: The mvn command was not found when checking the Maven installation\n    - Solution: The Maven build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is critical for compiling and testing Maven-based projects. The root cause was a missing build tool dependency in the environment setup. The solution was to install Maven via the apt package manager, enabling project builds and test execution.\n    - Action: apt install -y maven\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- Maven\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: '>=8'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: pom.xml\n  install_command: mvn clean verify\n  name: Maven\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - temurin\n  - graalvm\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Java runtime was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and running Java-based projects. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 using the apt package manager after ensuring the system package index was updated.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Java runtime not installed, causing Maven build failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) in the environment, which is required for compiling and running Java projects. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 using the system package manager, providing the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Java and Maven were not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The build required Java and Maven to compile and run the Maven-based project. The root cause was the absence of these development tools in the environment configuration. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 JDK and Maven using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk maven\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was not installed on the system, causing the 'mvn' command to be unavailable for building the Java project.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Maven in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the unavailability of the build tool.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Maven dependency resolution failure during project build\n    - Solution: The build failed because the required artifact 'org.apache.dubbo:dubbo-build-tools:jar:1.0.0' was unavailable in the Maven central repository. The root cause was missing project dependencies in the local environment. The solution was to install all dependencies locally using the Maven install goal with tests skipped.\n    - Action: ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -Dstyle.color=never\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed during editable mode build due to missing Java dependency\n    - Solution: The build process required Java to run ANTLR for parser generation, but the Java Runtime Environment was not installed. The root cause was a missing build dependency in the environment configuration. The solution was to install the default JRE using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jre\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was missing, causing test failures during project execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Maven package in the environment. Maven is required for running certain integration tests in the project, specifically for the jib-maven-plugin module. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the command not found errors and allowed tests to pass.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A build plugin required a newer Java version than was installed.\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incompatible Java version (11) for a plugin requiring Java 17. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 to meet the dependency requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed Java version is incompatible with the project's build tool.\n    - Solution: The Gradle wrapper version was outdated and incompatible with the newer Java version (e.g., Java 21), causing build failures. The root cause was a version mismatch between the Java runtime and the build tool. The solution was to install an older, compatible Java version (OpenJDK 11).\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The Maven wrapper script failed due to a missing required JAR file\n    - Solution: The Maven wrapper requires maven-wrapper.jar to function, which was missing from the project's .mvn/wrapper directory. The root cause was an incomplete wrapper setup in the environment. The solution was to download the JAR from Maven Central using Python's urllib module, as standard download tools were unavailable.\n    - Action: python3 -c \"import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlretrieve('https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/wrapper/maven-wrapper/3.3.1/maven-wrapper-3.3.1.jar', '.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar')\"\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Java was not installed, causing the java command to fail\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running Java-based applications like Logstash. The solution was to install OpenJDK 11 using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: The mvn command was not found when checking the Maven installation\n    - Solution: The Maven build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is critical for compiling and testing Maven-based projects. The root cause was a missing build tool dependency in the environment setup. The solution was to install Maven via the apt package manager, enabling project builds and test execution.\n    - Action: apt install -y maven\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 using the apt package manager after ensuring the system package index was updated.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Java runtime not installed, causing Maven build failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) in the environment, which is required for compiling and running Java projects. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 using the system package manager, providing the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Java and Maven were not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The build required Java and Maven to compile and run the Maven-based project. The root cause was the absence of these development tools in the environment configuration. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 JDK and Maven using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk maven\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was not installed on the system, causing the 'mvn' command to be unavailable for building the Java project.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Maven in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the unavailability of the build tool.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Maven dependency resolution failure during project build\n    - Solution: The build failed because the required artifact 'org.apache.dubbo:dubbo-build-tools:jar:1.0.0' was unavailable in the Maven central repository. The root cause was missing project dependencies in the local environment. The solution was to install all dependencies locally using the Maven install goal with tests skipped.\n    - Action: ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -Dstyle.color=never\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed during editable mode build due to missing Java dependency\n    - Solution: The build process required Java to run ANTLR for parser generation, but the Java Runtime Environment was not installed. The root cause was a missing build dependency in the environment configuration. The solution was to install the default JRE using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jre\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was missing, causing test failures during project execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Maven package in the environment. Maven is required for running certain integration tests in the project, specifically for the jib-maven-plugin module. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the command not found errors and allowed tests to pass.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A build plugin required a newer Java version than was installed.\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incompatible Java version (11) for a plugin requiring Java 17. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 to meet the dependency requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed Java version is incompatible with the project's build tool.\n    - Solution: The Gradle wrapper version was outdated and incompatible with the newer Java version (e.g., Java 21), causing build failures. The root cause was a version mismatch between the Java runtime and the build tool. The solution was to install an older, compatible Java version (OpenJDK 11).\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The Maven wrapper script failed due to a missing required JAR file\n    - Solution: The Maven wrapper requires maven-wrapper.jar to function, which was missing from the project's .mvn/wrapper directory. The root cause was an incomplete wrapper setup in the environment. The solution was to download the JAR from Maven Central using Python's urllib module, as standard download tools were unavailable.\n    - Action: python3 -c \"import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlretrieve('https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/wrapper/maven-wrapper/3.3.1/maven-wrapper-3.3.1.jar', '.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar')\"\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Java was not installed, causing the java command to fail\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running Java-based applications like Logstash. The solution was to install OpenJDK 11 using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: The mvn command was not found when checking the Maven installation\n    - Solution: The Maven build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is critical for compiling and testing Maven-based projects. The root cause was a missing build tool dependency in the environment setup. The solution was to install Maven via the apt package manager, enabling project builds and test execution.\n    - Action: apt install -y maven\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- Maven\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: '>=8'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: pom.xml\n  install_command: mvn clean verify\n  name: Maven\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - temurin\n  - graalvm\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Java runtime was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and running Java-based projects. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 using the apt package manager after ensuring the system package index was updated.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Java runtime not installed, causing Maven build failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) in the environment, which is required for compiling and running Java projects. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 using the system package manager, providing the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Java and Maven were not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The build required Java and Maven to compile and run the Maven-based project. The root cause was the absence of these development tools in the environment configuration. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 JDK and Maven using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk maven\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was not installed on the system, causing the 'mvn' command to be unavailable for building the Java project.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Maven in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the unavailability of the build tool.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Maven dependency resolution failure during project build\n    - Solution: The build failed because the required artifact 'org.apache.dubbo:dubbo-build-tools:jar:1.0.0' was unavailable in the Maven central repository. The root cause was missing project dependencies in the local environment. The solution was to install all dependencies locally using the Maven install goal with tests skipped.\n    - Action: ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -Dstyle.color=never\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed during editable mode build due to missing Java dependency\n    - Solution: The build process required Java to run ANTLR for parser generation, but the Java Runtime Environment was not installed. The root cause was a missing build dependency in the environment configuration. The solution was to install the default JRE using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jre\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was missing, causing test failures during project execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Maven package in the environment. Maven is required for running certain integration tests in the project, specifically for the jib-maven-plugin module. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the command not found errors and allowed tests to pass.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A build plugin required a newer Java version than was installed.\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incompatible Java version (11) for a plugin requiring Java 17. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 to meet the dependency requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed Java version is incompatible with the project's build tool.\n    - Solution: The Gradle wrapper version was outdated and incompatible with the newer Java version (e.g., Java 21), causing build failures. The root cause was a version mismatch between the Java runtime and the build tool. The solution was to install an older, compatible Java version (OpenJDK 11).\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The Maven wrapper script failed due to a missing required JAR file\n    - Solution: The Maven wrapper requires maven-wrapper.jar to function, which was missing from the project's .mvn/wrapper directory. The root cause was an incomplete wrapper setup in the environment. The solution was to download the JAR from Maven Central using Python's urllib module, as standard download tools were unavailable.\n    - Action: python3 -c \"import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlretrieve('https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/wrapper/maven-wrapper/3.3.1/maven-wrapper-3.3.1.jar', '.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar')\"\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Java was not installed, causing the java command to fail\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running Java-based applications like Logstash. The solution was to install OpenJDK 11 using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: The mvn command was not found when checking the Maven installation\n    - Solution: The Maven build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is critical for compiling and testing Maven-based projects. The root cause was a missing build tool dependency in the environment setup. The solution was to install Maven via the apt package manager, enabling project builds and test execution.\n    - Action: apt install -y maven\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- Maven\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: '>=8'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: pom.xml\n  install_command: mvn clean verify\n  name: Maven\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - temurin\n  - graalvm\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Java runtime was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and running Java-based projects. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 using the apt package manager after ensuring the system package index was updated.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Java runtime not installed, causing Maven build failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) in the environment, which is required for compiling and running Java projects. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 using the system package manager, providing the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Java and Maven were not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The build required Java and Maven to compile and run the Maven-based project. The root cause was the absence of these development tools in the environment configuration. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 JDK and Maven using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk maven\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was not installed on the system, causing the 'mvn' command to be unavailable for building the Java project.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Maven in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the unavailability of the build tool.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Maven dependency resolution failure during project build\n    - Solution: The build failed because the required artifact 'org.apache.dubbo:dubbo-build-tools:jar:1.0.0' was unavailable in the Maven central repository. The root cause was missing project dependencies in the local environment. The solution was to install all dependencies locally using the Maven install goal with tests skipped.\n    - Action: ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -Dstyle.color=never\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed during editable mode build due to missing Java dependency\n    - Solution: The build process required Java to run ANTLR for parser generation, but the Java Runtime Environment was not installed. The root cause was a missing build dependency in the environment configuration. The solution was to install the default JRE using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jre\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was missing, causing test failures during project execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Maven package in the environment. Maven is required for running certain integration tests in the project, specifically for the jib-maven-plugin module. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the command not found errors and allowed tests to pass.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A build plugin required a newer Java version than was installed.\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incompatible Java version (11) for a plugin requiring Java 17. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 to meet the dependency requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed Java version is incompatible with the project's build tool.\n    - Solution: The Gradle wrapper version was outdated and incompatible with the newer Java version (e.g., Java 21), causing build failures. The root cause was a version mismatch between the Java runtime and the build tool. The solution was to install an older, compatible Java version (OpenJDK 11).\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The Maven wrapper script failed due to a missing required JAR file\n    - Solution: The Maven wrapper requires maven-wrapper.jar to function, which was missing from the project's .mvn/wrapper directory. The root cause was an incomplete wrapper setup in the environment. The solution was to download the JAR from Maven Central using Python's urllib module, as standard download tools were unavailable.\n    - Action: python3 -c \"import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlretrieve('https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/wrapper/maven-wrapper/3.3.1/maven-wrapper-3.3.1.jar', '.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar')\"\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Java was not installed, causing the java command to fail\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running Java-based applications like Logstash. The solution was to install OpenJDK 11 using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: The mvn command was not found when checking the Maven installation\n    - Solution: The Maven build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is critical for compiling and testing Maven-based projects. The root cause was a missing build tool dependency in the environment setup. The solution was to install Maven via the apt package manager, enabling project builds and test execution.\n    - Action: apt install -y maven\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- Maven\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: '>=8'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: pom.xml\n  install_command: mvn clean verify\n  name: Maven\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - temurin\n  - graalvm\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Java runtime was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and running Java-based projects. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 using the apt package manager after ensuring the system package index was updated.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Java runtime not installed, causing Maven build failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) in the environment, which is required for compiling and running Java projects. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 using the system package manager, providing the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Java and Maven were not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The build required Java and Maven to compile and run the Maven-based project. The root cause was the absence of these development tools in the environment configuration. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 JDK and Maven using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk maven\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was not installed on the system, causing the 'mvn' command to be unavailable for building the Java project.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Maven in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the unavailability of the build tool.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Maven dependency resolution failure during project build\n    - Solution: The build failed because the required artifact 'org.apache.dubbo:dubbo-build-tools:jar:1.0.0' was unavailable in the Maven central repository. The root cause was missing project dependencies in the local environment. The solution was to install all dependencies locally using the Maven install goal with tests skipped.\n    - Action: ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -Dstyle.color=never\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed during editable mode build due to missing Java dependency\n    - Solution: The build process required Java to run ANTLR for parser generation, but the Java Runtime Environment was not installed. The root cause was a missing build dependency in the environment configuration. The solution was to install the default JRE using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jre\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was missing, causing test failures during project execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Maven package in the environment. Maven is required for running certain integration tests in the project, specifically for the jib-maven-plugin module. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the command not found errors and allowed tests to pass.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A build plugin required a newer Java version than was installed.\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incompatible Java version (11) for a plugin requiring Java 17. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 to meet the dependency requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed Java version is incompatible with the project's build tool.\n    - Solution: The Gradle wrapper version was outdated and incompatible with the newer Java version (e.g., Java 21), causing build failures. The root cause was a version mismatch between the Java runtime and the build tool. The solution was to install an older, compatible Java version (OpenJDK 11).\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The Maven wrapper script failed due to a missing required JAR file\n    - Solution: The Maven wrapper requires maven-wrapper.jar to function, which was missing from the project's .mvn/wrapper directory. The root cause was an incomplete wrapper setup in the environment. The solution was to download the JAR from Maven Central using Python's urllib module, as standard download tools were unavailable.\n    - Action: python3 -c \"import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlretrieve('https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/wrapper/maven-wrapper/3.3.1/maven-wrapper-3.3.1.jar', '.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar')\"\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Java was not installed, causing the java command to fail\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running Java-based applications like Logstash. The solution was to install OpenJDK 11 using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: The mvn command was not found when checking the Maven installation\n    - Solution: The Maven build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is critical for compiling and testing Maven-based projects. The root cause was a missing build tool dependency in the environment setup. The solution was to install Maven via the apt package manager, enabling project builds and test execution.\n    - Action: apt install -y maven\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- Maven\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: '>=8'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: pom.xml\n  install_command: mvn clean verify\n  name: Maven\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - temurin\n  - graalvm\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Java runtime was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and running Java-based projects. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 using the apt package manager after ensuring the system package index was updated.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Java runtime not installed, causing Maven build failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) in the environment, which is required for compiling and running Java projects. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 using the system package manager, providing the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Java and Maven were not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The build required Java and Maven to compile and run the Maven-based project. The root cause was the absence of these development tools in the environment configuration. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 JDK and Maven using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk maven\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was not installed on the system, causing the 'mvn' command to be unavailable for building the Java project.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Maven in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the unavailability of the build tool.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Maven dependency resolution failure during project build\n    - Solution: The build failed because the required artifact 'org.apache.dubbo:dubbo-build-tools:jar:1.0.0' was unavailable in the Maven central repository. The root cause was missing project dependencies in the local environment. The solution was to install all dependencies locally using the Maven install goal with tests skipped.\n    - Action: ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -Dstyle.color=never\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed during editable mode build due to missing Java dependency\n    - Solution: The build process required Java to run ANTLR for parser generation, but the Java Runtime Environment was not installed. The root cause was a missing build dependency in the environment configuration. The solution was to install the default JRE using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jre\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was missing, causing test failures during project execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Maven package in the environment. Maven is required for running certain integration tests in the project, specifically for the jib-maven-plugin module. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the command not found errors and allowed tests to pass.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A build plugin required a newer Java version than was installed.\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incompatible Java version (11) for a plugin requiring Java 17. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 to meet the dependency requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed Java version is incompatible with the project's build tool.\n    - Solution: The Gradle wrapper version was outdated and incompatible with the newer Java version (e.g., Java 21), causing build failures. The root cause was a version mismatch between the Java runtime and the build tool. The solution was to install an older, compatible Java version (OpenJDK 11).\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The Maven wrapper script failed due to a missing required JAR file\n    - Solution: The Maven wrapper requires maven-wrapper.jar to function, which was missing from the project's .mvn/wrapper directory. The root cause was an incomplete wrapper setup in the environment. The solution was to download the JAR from Maven Central using Python's urllib module, as standard download tools were unavailable.\n    - Action: python3 -c \"import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlretrieve('https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/wrapper/maven-wrapper/3.3.1/maven-wrapper-3.3.1.jar', '.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar')\"\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Java was not installed, causing the java command to fail\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running Java-based applications like Logstash. The solution was to install OpenJDK 11 using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: The mvn command was not found when checking the Maven installation\n    - Solution: The Maven build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is critical for compiling and testing Maven-based projects. The root cause was a missing build tool dependency in the environment setup. The solution was to install Maven via the apt package manager, enabling project builds and test execution.\n    - Action: apt install -y maven\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- Maven\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: '>=8'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: pom.xml\n  install_command: mvn clean verify\n  name: Maven\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - temurin\n  - graalvm\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Java runtime was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and running Java-based projects. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 using the apt package manager after ensuring the system package index was updated.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Java runtime not installed, causing Maven build failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) in the environment, which is required for compiling and running Java projects. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 using the system package manager, providing the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Java and Maven were not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The build required Java and Maven to compile and run the Maven-based project. The root cause was the absence of these development tools in the environment configuration. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 JDK and Maven using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk maven\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was not installed on the system, causing the 'mvn' command to be unavailable for building the Java project.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Maven in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the unavailability of the build tool.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Maven dependency resolution failure during project build\n    - Solution: The build failed because the required artifact 'org.apache.dubbo:dubbo-build-tools:jar:1.0.0' was unavailable in the Maven central repository. The root cause was missing project dependencies in the local environment. The solution was to install all dependencies locally using the Maven install goal with tests skipped.\n    - Action: ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -Dstyle.color=never\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed during editable mode build due to missing Java dependency\n    - Solution: The build process required Java to run ANTLR for parser generation, but the Java Runtime Environment was not installed. The root cause was a missing build dependency in the environment configuration. The solution was to install the default JRE using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jre\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was missing, causing test failures during project execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Maven package in the environment. Maven is required for running certain integration tests in the project, specifically for the jib-maven-plugin module. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the command not found errors and allowed tests to pass.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A build plugin required a newer Java version than was installed.\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incompatible Java version (11) for a plugin requiring Java 17. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 to meet the dependency requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed Java version is incompatible with the project's build tool.\n    - Solution: The Gradle wrapper version was outdated and incompatible with the newer Java version (e.g., Java 21), causing build failures. The root cause was a version mismatch between the Java runtime and the build tool. The solution was to install an older, compatible Java version (OpenJDK 11).\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The Maven wrapper script failed due to a missing required JAR file\n    - Solution: The Maven wrapper requires maven-wrapper.jar to function, which was missing from the project's .mvn/wrapper directory. The root cause was an incomplete wrapper setup in the environment. The solution was to download the JAR from Maven Central using Python's urllib module, as standard download tools were unavailable.\n    - Action: python3 -c \"import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlretrieve('https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/wrapper/maven-wrapper/3.3.1/maven-wrapper-3.3.1.jar', '.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar')\"\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Java was not installed, causing the java command to fail\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running Java-based applications like Logstash. The solution was to install OpenJDK 11 using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: The mvn command was not found when checking the Maven installation\n    - Solution: The Maven build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is critical for compiling and testing Maven-based projects. The root cause was a missing build tool dependency in the environment setup. The solution was to install Maven via the apt package manager, enabling project builds and test execution.\n    - Action: apt install -y maven\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- Maven\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: '>=8'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: pom.xml\n  install_command: mvn clean verify\n  name: Maven\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - temurin\n  - graalvm\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Java runtime was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and running Java-based projects. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 using the apt package manager after ensuring the system package index was updated.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Java runtime not installed, causing Maven build failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) in the environment, which is required for compiling and running Java projects. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 using the system package manager, providing the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Java and Maven were not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The build required Java and Maven to compile and run the Maven-based project. The root cause was the absence of these development tools in the environment configuration. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 JDK and Maven using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk maven\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was not installed on the system, causing the 'mvn' command to be unavailable for building the Java project.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Maven in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the unavailability of the build tool.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Maven dependency resolution failure during project build\n    - Solution: The build failed because the required artifact 'org.apache.dubbo:dubbo-build-tools:jar:1.0.0' was unavailable in the Maven central repository. The root cause was missing project dependencies in the local environment. The solution was to install all dependencies locally using the Maven install goal with tests skipped.\n    - Action: ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -Dstyle.color=never\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed during editable mode build due to missing Java dependency\n    - Solution: The build process required Java to run ANTLR for parser generation, but the Java Runtime Environment was not installed. The root cause was a missing build dependency in the environment configuration. The solution was to install the default JRE using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jre\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was missing, causing test failures during project execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Maven package in the environment. Maven is required for running certain integration tests in the project, specifically for the jib-maven-plugin module. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the command not found errors and allowed tests to pass.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A build plugin required a newer Java version than was installed.\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incompatible Java version (11) for a plugin requiring Java 17. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 to meet the dependency requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed Java version is incompatible with the project's build tool.\n    - Solution: The Gradle wrapper version was outdated and incompatible with the newer Java version (e.g., Java 21), causing build failures. The root cause was a version mismatch between the Java runtime and the build tool. The solution was to install an older, compatible Java version (OpenJDK 11).\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The Maven wrapper script failed due to a missing required JAR file\n    - Solution: The Maven wrapper requires maven-wrapper.jar to function, which was missing from the project's .mvn/wrapper directory. The root cause was an incomplete wrapper setup in the environment. The solution was to download the JAR from Maven Central using Python's urllib module, as standard download tools were unavailable.\n    - Action: python3 -c \"import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlretrieve('https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/wrapper/maven-wrapper/3.3.1/maven-wrapper-3.3.1.jar', '.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar')\"\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Java was not installed, causing the java command to fail\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running Java-based applications like Logstash. The solution was to install OpenJDK 11 using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: The mvn command was not found when checking the Maven installation\n    - Solution: The Maven build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is critical for compiling and testing Maven-based projects. The root cause was a missing build tool dependency in the environment setup. The solution was to install Maven via the apt package manager, enabling project builds and test execution.\n    - Action: apt install -y maven\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- Maven\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: '>=8'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: pom.xml\n  install_command: mvn clean verify\n  name: Maven\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - temurin\n  - graalvm\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Java runtime was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and running Java-based projects. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 using the apt package manager after ensuring the system package index was updated.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Java runtime not installed, causing Maven build failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) in the environment, which is required for compiling and running Java projects. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 using the system package manager, providing the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Java and Maven were not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The build required Java and Maven to compile and run the Maven-based project. The root cause was the absence of these development tools in the environment configuration. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 JDK and Maven using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk maven\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was not installed on the system, causing the 'mvn' command to be unavailable for building the Java project.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Maven in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the unavailability of the build tool.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Maven dependency resolution failure during project build\n    - Solution: The build failed because the required artifact 'org.apache.dubbo:dubbo-build-tools:jar:1.0.0' was unavailable in the Maven central repository. The root cause was missing project dependencies in the local environment. The solution was to install all dependencies locally using the Maven install goal with tests skipped.\n    - Action: ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -Dstyle.color=never\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed during editable mode build due to missing Java dependency\n    - Solution: The build process required Java to run ANTLR for parser generation, but the Java Runtime Environment was not installed. The root cause was a missing build dependency in the environment configuration. The solution was to install the default JRE using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jre\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was missing, causing test failures during project execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Maven package in the environment. Maven is required for running certain integration tests in the project, specifically for the jib-maven-plugin module. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the command not found errors and allowed tests to pass.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A build plugin required a newer Java version than was installed.\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incompatible Java version (11) for a plugin requiring Java 17. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 to meet the dependency requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed Java version is incompatible with the project's build tool.\n    - Solution: The Gradle wrapper version was outdated and incompatible with the newer Java version (e.g., Java 21), causing build failures. The root cause was a version mismatch between the Java runtime and the build tool. The solution was to install an older, compatible Java version (OpenJDK 11).\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The Maven wrapper script failed due to a missing required JAR file\n    - Solution: The Maven wrapper requires maven-wrapper.jar to function, which was missing from the project's .mvn/wrapper directory. The root cause was an incomplete wrapper setup in the environment. The solution was to download the JAR from Maven Central using Python's urllib module, as standard download tools were unavailable.\n    - Action: python3 -c \"import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlretrieve('https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/wrapper/maven-wrapper/3.3.1/maven-wrapper-3.3.1.jar', '.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar')\"\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Java was not installed, causing the java command to fail\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running Java-based applications like Logstash. The solution was to install OpenJDK 11 using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: The mvn command was not found when checking the Maven installation\n    - Solution: The Maven build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is critical for compiling and testing Maven-based projects. The root cause was a missing build tool dependency in the environment setup. The solution was to install Maven via the apt package manager, enabling project builds and test execution.\n    - Action: apt install -y maven\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nHere is the repository related information:\nbuild_tools:\n- Maven\nlanguage:\n  name: Java\n  version_constraint: '>=8'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: pom.xml\n  install_command: mvn clean verify\n  name: Maven\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - temurin\n  - graalvm\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework: []\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge to configure the environment:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The Java runtime was not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu environment, which is required for building and running Java-based projects. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 using the apt package manager after ensuring the system package index was updated.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: Java runtime not installed, causing Maven build failures\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of a Java Development Kit (JDK) in the environment, which is required for compiling and running Java projects. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 using the system package manager, providing the necessary Java runtime and development tools.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Java and Maven were not installed on the Ubuntu system\n    - Solution: The build required Java and Maven to compile and run the Maven-based project. The root cause was the absence of these development tools in the environment configuration. The solution was to install OpenJDK 17 JDK and Maven using the apt package manager.\n    - Action: apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk maven\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was not installed on the system, causing the 'mvn' command to be unavailable for building the Java project.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Maven in the environment configuration. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the unavailability of the build tool.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Maven dependency resolution failure during project build\n    - Solution: The build failed because the required artifact 'org.apache.dubbo:dubbo-build-tools:jar:1.0.0' was unavailable in the Maven central repository. The root cause was missing project dependencies in the local environment. The solution was to install all dependencies locally using the Maven install goal with tests skipped.\n    - Action: ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -Dstyle.color=never\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Package installation failed during editable mode build due to missing Java dependency\n    - Solution: The build process required Java to run ANTLR for parser generation, but the Java Runtime Environment was not installed. The root cause was a missing build dependency in the environment configuration. The solution was to install the default JRE using the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jre\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The Maven build tool was missing, causing test failures during project execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Maven package in the environment. Maven is required for running certain integration tests in the project, specifically for the jib-maven-plugin module. The solution was to install Maven using the system package manager, which resolved the command not found errors and allowed tests to pass.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y maven\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: A build plugin required a newer Java version than was installed.\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incompatible Java version (11) for a plugin requiring Java 17. The solution involved installing OpenJDK 17 to meet the dependency requirements.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The installed Java version is incompatible with the project's build tool.\n    - Solution: The Gradle wrapper version was outdated and incompatible with the newer Java version (e.g., Java 21), causing build failures. The root cause was a version mismatch between the Java runtime and the build tool. The solution was to install an older, compatible Java version (OpenJDK 11).\n    - Action: apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: The Maven wrapper script failed due to a missing required JAR file\n    - Solution: The Maven wrapper requires maven-wrapper.jar to function, which was missing from the project's .mvn/wrapper directory. The root cause was an incomplete wrapper setup in the environment. The solution was to download the JAR from Maven Central using Python's urllib module, as standard download tools were unavailable.\n    - Action: python3 -c \"import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlretrieve('https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/wrapper/maven-wrapper/3.3.1/maven-wrapper-3.3.1.jar', '.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar')\"\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Java was not installed, causing the java command to fail\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Ubuntu system, which is required for running Java-based applications like Logstash. The solution was to install OpenJDK 11 using the apt package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: The mvn command was not found when checking the Maven installation\n    - Solution: The Maven build tool was not installed on the Ubuntu system, which is critical for compiling and testing Maven-based projects. The root cause was a missing build tool dependency in the environment setup. The solution was to install Maven via the apt package manager, enabling project builds and test execution.\n    - Action: apt install -y maven\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\",\"instance_template\":\"We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\\n\\n{{repo_related_info}}\\n\\n{{cross_repo_knowledge}}\\n\\nTASK TIPS:\\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them.
