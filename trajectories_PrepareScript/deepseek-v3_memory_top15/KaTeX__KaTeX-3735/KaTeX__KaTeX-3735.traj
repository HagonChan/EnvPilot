Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The ts-jest preset was missing during test execution causing validation errors\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of ts-jest and TypeScript dependencies locally in each workspace package, despite global installation. The project configuration required these dependencies per-package for Jest to process TypeScript tests. The solution was to install ts-jest and @types/jest in every package directory.\n    - Action: cd packages && for d in */; do cd \"$d\" && npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest && cd ..; done\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Running the full test suite with yarn test timed out due to excessive execution time.\n    - Solution: The comprehensive test suite exceeded the environment's timeout threshold, likely due to resource constraints or test volume. The root cause was insufficient time allocation for test execution. The solution was to run targeted subsets of tests to avoid timeouts.\n    - Action: yarn mocha packages/mui-material/test/integration/**/*.test.js\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: npm install failed with an ERESOLVE error due to unresolved dependency conflict.\n    - Solution: The project dependencies had incompatible peer requirements, specifically rollup-plugin-babel required rollup >=0.60.0 but the project specified rollup@0.57.1. The root cause was a version mismatch in peer dependencies. The solution was to use the --legacy-peer-deps option to bypass peer dependency checks and allow installation to proceed.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The ts-jest preset was missing during test execution causing validation errors\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of ts-jest and TypeScript dependencies locally in each workspace package, despite global installation. The project configuration required these dependencies per-package for Jest to process TypeScript tests. The solution was to install ts-jest and @types/jest in every package directory.\n    - Action: cd packages && for d in */; do cd \"$d\" && npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest && cd ..; done\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Running the full test suite with yarn test timed out due to excessive execution time.\n    - Solution: The comprehensive test suite exceeded the environment's timeout threshold, likely due to resource constraints or test volume. The root cause was insufficient time allocation for test execution. The solution was to run targeted subsets of tests to avoid timeouts.\n    - Action: yarn mocha packages/mui-material/test/integration/**/*.test.js\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: npm install failed with an ERESOLVE error due to unresolved dependency conflict.\n    - Solution: The project dependencies had incompatible peer requirements, specifically rollup-plugin-babel required rollup >=0.60.0 but the project specified rollup@0.57.1. The root cause was a version mismatch in peer dependencies. The solution was to use the --legacy-peer-deps option to bypass peer dependency checks and allow installation to proceed.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The ts-jest preset was missing during test execution causing validation errors\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of ts-jest and TypeScript dependencies locally in each workspace package, despite global installation. The project configuration required these dependencies per-package for Jest to process TypeScript tests. The solution was to install ts-jest and @types/jest in every package directory.\n    - Action: cd packages && for d in */; do cd \"$d\" && npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest && cd ..; done\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Running the full test suite with yarn test timed out due to excessive execution time.\n    - Solution: The comprehensive test suite exceeded the environment's timeout threshold, likely due to resource constraints or test volume. The root cause was insufficient time allocation for test execution. The solution was to run targeted subsets of tests to avoid timeouts.\n    - Action: yarn mocha packages/mui-material/test/integration/**/*.test.js\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: npm install failed with an ERESOLVE error due to unresolved dependency conflict.\n    - Solution: The project dependencies had incompatible peer requirements, specifically rollup-plugin-babel required rollup >=0.60.0 but the project specified rollup@0.57.1. The root cause was a version mismatch in peer dependencies. The solution was to use the --legacy-peer-deps option to bypass peer dependency checks and allow installation to proceed.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The ts-jest preset was missing during test execution causing validation errors\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of ts-jest and TypeScript dependencies locally in each workspace package, despite global installation. The project configuration required these dependencies per-package for Jest to process TypeScript tests. The solution was to install ts-jest and @types/jest in every package directory.\n    - Action: cd packages && for d in */; do cd \"$d\" && npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest && cd ..; done\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Running the full test suite with yarn test timed out due to excessive execution time.\n    - Solution: The comprehensive test suite exceeded the environment's timeout threshold, likely due to resource constraints or test volume. The root cause was insufficient time allocation for test execution. The solution was to run targeted subsets of tests to avoid timeouts.\n    - Action: yarn mocha packages/mui-material/test/integration/**/*.test.js\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: npm install failed with an ERESOLVE error due to unresolved dependency conflict.\n    - Solution: The project dependencies had incompatible peer requirements, specifically rollup-plugin-babel required rollup >=0.60.0 but the project specified rollup@0.57.1. The root cause was a version mismatch in peer dependencies. The solution was to use the --legacy-peer-deps option to bypass peer dependency checks and allow installation to proceed.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

See how it compares to a competitor in [this speed test](https://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).\n15: * **Print quality:** KaTeX's layout is based on Donald Knuth's TeX, the gold standard for math typesetting.\n16: * **Self contained:** KaTeX has no dependencies and can easily be bundled with your website resources.\n17: * **Server side rendering:** KaTeX produces the same output regardless of browser or environment, so you can pre-render expressions using Node.js and send them as plain HTML.\n18:\n19:KaTeX is compatible with all major browsers, including Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, Edge, and IE 11.\n20:\n21:KaTeX supports much (but not all) of LaTeX and many LaTeX packages. See the [list of supported functions](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html).\n22:\n23:Try out KaTeX [on the demo page](https://katex.org/#demo)!\n24:\n25:## Getting started\n26:\n27:### Starter template\n28:\n29:```html\n30:<!DOCTYPE html>\n31:<!-- KaTeX requires the use of the HTML5 doctype.

For example:\n64:\n65:```js\n66:var html = katex.renderToString(\"c = \\\\pm\\\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\", {\n67:    throwOnError: false\n68:});\n69:// '<span class=\"katex\">...</span>'\n70:```\n71:\n72:Make sure to include the CSS and font files in both cases.\n73:If you are doing all rendering on the server, there is no need to include the\n74:JavaScript on the client.\n75:\n76:The examples above use the `throwOnError: false` option, which renders invalid\n77:inputs as the TeX source code in red (by default), with the error message as\n78:hover text.

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The ts-jest preset was missing during test execution causing validation errors\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of ts-jest and TypeScript dependencies locally in each workspace package, despite global installation. The project configuration required these dependencies per-package for Jest to process TypeScript tests. The solution was to install ts-jest and @types/jest in every package directory.\n    - Action: cd packages && for d in */; do cd \"$d\" && npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest && cd ..; done\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Running the full test suite with yarn test timed out due to excessive execution time.\n    - Solution: The comprehensive test suite exceeded the environment's timeout threshold, likely due to resource constraints or test volume. The root cause was insufficient time allocation for test execution. The solution was to run targeted subsets of tests to avoid timeouts.\n    - Action: yarn mocha packages/mui-material/test/integration/**/*.test.js\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: npm install failed with an ERESOLVE error due to unresolved dependency conflict.\n    - Solution: The project dependencies had incompatible peer requirements, specifically rollup-plugin-babel required rollup >=0.60.0 but the project specified rollup@0.57.1. The root cause was a version mismatch in peer dependencies. The solution was to use the --legacy-peer-deps option to bypass peer dependency checks and allow installation to proceed.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

See how it compares to a competitor in [this speed test](https://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).\n15: * **Print quality:** KaTeX's layout is based on Donald Knuth's TeX, the gold standard for math typesetting.\n16: * **Self contained:** KaTeX has no dependencies and can easily be bundled with your website resources.\n17: * **Server side rendering:** KaTeX produces the same output regardless of browser or environment, so you can pre-render expressions using Node.js and send them as plain HTML.\n18:\n19:KaTeX is compatible with all major browsers, including Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, Edge, and IE 11.\n20:\n21:KaTeX supports much (but not all) of LaTeX and many LaTeX packages. See the [list of supported functions](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html).\n22:\n23:Try out KaTeX [on the demo page](https://katex.org/#demo)!\n24:\n25:## Getting started\n26:\n27:### Starter template\n28:\n29:```html\n30:<!DOCTYPE html>\n31:<!-- KaTeX requires the use of the HTML5 doctype.

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The ts-jest preset was missing during test execution causing validation errors\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of ts-jest and TypeScript dependencies locally in each workspace package, despite global installation. The project configuration required these dependencies per-package for Jest to process TypeScript tests. The solution was to install ts-jest and @types/jest in every package directory.\n    - Action: cd packages && for d in */; do cd \"$d\" && npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest && cd ..; done\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Running the full test suite with yarn test timed out due to excessive execution time.\n    - Solution: The comprehensive test suite exceeded the environment's timeout threshold, likely due to resource constraints or test volume. The root cause was insufficient time allocation for test execution. The solution was to run targeted subsets of tests to avoid timeouts.\n    - Action: yarn mocha packages/mui-material/test/integration/**/*.test.js\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: npm install failed with an ERESOLVE error due to unresolved dependency conflict.\n    - Solution: The project dependencies had incompatible peer requirements, specifically rollup-plugin-babel required rollup >=0.60.0 but the project specified rollup@0.57.1. The root cause was a version mismatch in peer dependencies. The solution was to use the --legacy-peer-deps option to bypass peer dependency checks and allow installation to proceed.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

See how it compares to a competitor in [this speed test](https://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).\n15: * **Print quality:** KaTeX's layout is based on Donald Knuth's TeX, the gold standard for math typesetting.\n16: * **Self contained:** KaTeX has no dependencies and can easily be bundled with your website resources.\n17: * **Server side rendering:** KaTeX produces the same output regardless of browser or environment, so you can pre-render expressions using Node.js and send them as plain HTML.\n18:\n19:KaTeX is compatible with all major browsers, including Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, Edge, and IE 11.\n20:\n21:KaTeX supports much (but not all) of LaTeX and many LaTeX packages. See the [list of supported functions](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html).\n22:\n23:Try out KaTeX [on the demo page](https://katex.org/#demo)!\n24:\n25:## Getting started\n26:\n27:### Starter template\n28:\n29:```html\n30:<!DOCTYPE html>\n31:<!-- KaTeX requires the use of the HTML5 doctype.

For example:\n64:\n65:```js\n66:var html = katex.renderToString(\"c = \\\\pm\\\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\", {\n67:    throwOnError: false\n68:});\n69:// '<span class=\"katex\">...</span>'\n70:```\n71:\n72:Make sure to include the CSS and font files in both cases.\n73:If you are doing all rendering on the server, there is no need to include the\n74:JavaScript on the client.\n75:\n76:The examples above use the `throwOnError: false` option, which renders invalid\n77:inputs as the TeX source code in red (by default), with the error message as\n78:hover text.  For other available options, see the\n79:[API documentation](https://katex.org/docs/api.html),\n80:[options documentation](https://katex.org/docs/options.html), and\n81:[handling errors documentation](https://katex.org/docs/error.html).\n82:\n83:## Demo and Documentation\n84:\n85:Learn more about using KaTeX [on the website](https://katex.org)!\n86:\n87:## Contributors\n88:\n89:### Code Contributors\n90:\n91:This project exists thanks to all the people who contribute code.

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The ts-jest preset was missing during test execution causing validation errors\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of ts-jest and TypeScript dependencies locally in each workspace package, despite global installation. The project configuration required these dependencies per-package for Jest to process TypeScript tests. The solution was to install ts-jest and @types/jest in every package directory.\n    - Action: cd packages && for d in */; do cd \"$d\" && npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest && cd ..; done\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Running the full test suite with yarn test timed out due to excessive execution time.\n    - Solution: The comprehensive test suite exceeded the environment's timeout threshold, likely due to resource constraints or test volume. The root cause was insufficient time allocation for test execution. The solution was to run targeted subsets of tests to avoid timeouts.\n    - Action: yarn mocha packages/mui-material/test/integration/**/*.test.js\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: npm install failed with an ERESOLVE error due to unresolved dependency conflict.\n    - Solution: The project dependencies had incompatible peer requirements, specifically rollup-plugin-babel required rollup >=0.60.0 but the project specified rollup@0.57.1. The root cause was a version mismatch in peer dependencies. The solution was to use the --legacy-peer-deps option to bypass peer dependency checks and allow installation to proceed.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

See how it compares to a competitor in [this speed test](https://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).\n15: * **Print quality:** KaTeX's layout is based on Donald Knuth's TeX, the gold standard for math typesetting.\n16: * **Self contained:** KaTeX has no dependencies and can easily be bundled with your website resources.\n17: * **Server side rendering:** KaTeX produces the same output regardless of browser or environment, so you can pre-render expressions using Node.js and send them as plain HTML.\n18:\n19:KaTeX is compatible with all major browsers, including Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, Edge, and IE 11.\n20:\n21:KaTeX supports much (but not all) of LaTeX and many LaTeX packages. See the [list of supported functions](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html).\n22:\n23:Try out KaTeX [on the demo page](https://katex.org/#demo)!\n24:\n25:## Getting started\n26:\n27:### Starter template\n28:\n29:```html\n30:<!DOCTYPE html>\n31:<!-- KaTeX requires the use of the HTML5 doctype.

For example:\n64:\n65:```js\n66:var html = katex.renderToString(\"c = \\\\pm\\\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\", {\n67:    throwOnError: false\n68:});\n69:// '<span class=\"katex\">...</span>'\n70:```\n71:\n72:Make sure to include the CSS and font files in both cases.\n73:If you are doing all rendering on the server, there is no need to include the\n74:JavaScript on the client.\n75:\n76:The examples above use the `throwOnError: false` option, which renders invalid\n77:inputs as the TeX source code in red (by default), with the error message as\n78:hover text.  For other available options, see the\n79:[API documentation](https://katex.org/docs/api.html),\n80:[options documentation](https://katex.org/docs/options.html), and\n81:[handling errors documentation](https://katex.org/docs/error.html).\n82:\n83:## Demo and Documentation\n84:\n85:Learn more about using KaTeX [on the website](https://katex.org)!\n86:\n87:## Contributors\n88:\n89:### Code Contributors\n90:\n91:This project exists thanks to all the people who contribute code.

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The ts-jest preset was missing during test execution causing validation errors\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of ts-jest and TypeScript dependencies locally in each workspace package, despite global installation. The project configuration required these dependencies per-package for Jest to process TypeScript tests. The solution was to install ts-jest and @types/jest in every package directory.\n    - Action: cd packages && for d in */; do cd \"$d\" && npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest && cd ..; done\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Running the full test suite with yarn test timed out due to excessive execution time.\n    - Solution: The comprehensive test suite exceeded the environment's timeout threshold, likely due to resource constraints or test volume. The root cause was insufficient time allocation for test execution. The solution was to run targeted subsets of tests to avoid timeouts.\n    - Action: yarn mocha packages/mui-material/test/integration/**/*.test.js\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: npm install failed with an ERESOLVE error due to unresolved dependency conflict.\n    - Solution: The project dependencies had incompatible peer requirements, specifically rollup-plugin-babel required rollup >=0.60.0 but the project specified rollup@0.57.1. The root cause was a version mismatch in peer dependencies. The solution was to use the --legacy-peer-deps option to bypass peer dependency checks and allow installation to proceed.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

See how it compares to a competitor in [this speed test](https://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).\n15: * **Print quality:** KaTeX's layout is based on Donald Knuth's TeX, the gold standard for math typesetting.\n16: * **Self contained:** KaTeX has no dependencies and can easily be bundled with your website resources.\n17: * **Server side rendering:** KaTeX produces the same output regardless of browser or environment, so you can pre-render expressions using Node.js and send them as plain HTML.\n18:\n19:KaTeX is compatible with all major browsers, including Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, Edge, and IE 11.\n20:\n21:KaTeX supports much (but not all) of LaTeX and many LaTeX packages. See the [list of supported functions](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html).\n22:\n23:Try out KaTeX [on the demo page](https://katex.org/#demo)!\n24:\n25:## Getting started\n26:\n27:### Starter template\n28:\n29:```html\n30:<!DOCTYPE html>\n31:<!-- KaTeX requires the use of the HTML5 doctype.

For example:\n64:\n65:```js\n66:var html = katex.renderToString(\"c = \\\\pm\\\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\", {\n67:    throwOnError: false\n68:});\n69:// '<span class=\"katex\">...</span>'\n70:```\n71:\n72:Make sure to include the CSS and font files in both cases.\n73:If you are doing all rendering on the server, there is no need to include the\n74:JavaScript on the client.\n75:\n76:The examples above use the `throwOnError: false` option, which renders invalid\n77:inputs as the TeX source code in red (by default), with the error message as\n78:hover text.  For other available options, see the\n79:[API documentation](https://katex.org/docs/api.html),\n80:[options documentation](https://katex.org/docs/options.html), and\n81:[handling errors documentation](https://katex.org/docs/error.html).\n82:\n83:## Demo and Documentation\n84:\n85:Learn more about using KaTeX [on the website](https://katex.org)!\n86:\n87:## Contributors\n88:\n89:### Code Contributors\n90:\n91:This project exists thanks to all the people who contribute code.

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The ts-jest preset was missing during test execution causing validation errors\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of ts-jest and TypeScript dependencies locally in each workspace package, despite global installation. The project configuration required these dependencies per-package for Jest to process TypeScript tests. The solution was to install ts-jest and @types/jest in every package directory.\n    - Action: cd packages && for d in */; do cd \"$d\" && npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest && cd ..; done\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Running the full test suite with yarn test timed out due to excessive execution time.\n    - Solution: The comprehensive test suite exceeded the environment's timeout threshold, likely due to resource constraints or test volume. The root cause was insufficient time allocation for test execution. The solution was to run targeted subsets of tests to avoid timeouts.\n    - Action: yarn mocha packages/mui-material/test/integration/**/*.test.js\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: npm install failed with an ERESOLVE error due to unresolved dependency conflict.\n    - Solution: The project dependencies had incompatible peer requirements, specifically rollup-plugin-babel required rollup >=0.60.0 but the project specified rollup@0.57.1. The root cause was a version mismatch in peer dependencies. The solution was to use the --legacy-peer-deps option to bypass peer dependency checks and allow installation to proceed.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

See how it compares to a competitor in [this speed test](https://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).\n15: * **Print quality:** KaTeX's layout is based on Donald Knuth's TeX, the gold standard for math typesetting.\n16: * **Self contained:** KaTeX has no dependencies and can easily be bundled with your website resources.\n17: * **Server side rendering:** KaTeX produces the same output regardless of browser or environment, so you can pre-render expressions using Node.js and send them as plain HTML.\n18:\n19:KaTeX is compatible with all major browsers, including Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, Edge, and IE 11.\n20:\n21:KaTeX supports much (but not all) of LaTeX and many LaTeX packages. See the [list of supported functions](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html).\n22:\n23:Try out KaTeX [on the demo page](https://katex.org/#demo)!\n24:\n25:## Getting started\n26:\n27:### Starter template\n28:\n29:```html\n30:<!DOCTYPE html>\n31:<!-- KaTeX requires the use of the HTML5 doctype.

For example:\n64:\n65:```js\n66:var html = katex.renderToString(\"c = \\\\pm\\\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\", {\n67:    throwOnError: false\n68:});\n69:// '<span class=\"katex\">...</span>'\n70:```\n71:\n72:Make sure to include the CSS and font files in both cases.\n73:If you are doing all rendering on the server, there is no need to include the\n74:JavaScript on the client.\n75:\n76:The examples above use the `throwOnError: false` option, which renders invalid\n77:inputs as the TeX source code in red (by default), with the error message as\n78:hover text.  For other available options, see the\n79:[API documentation](https://katex.org/docs/api.html),\n80:[options documentation](https://katex.org/docs/options.html), and\n81:[handling errors documentation](https://katex.org/docs/error.html).\n82:\n83:## Demo and Documentation\n84:\n85:Learn more about using KaTeX [on the website](https://katex.org)!\n86:\n87:## Contributors\n88:\n89:### Code Contributors\n90:\n91:This project exists thanks to all the people who contribute code.

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The ts-jest preset was missing during test execution causing validation errors\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of ts-jest and TypeScript dependencies locally in each workspace package, despite global installation. The project configuration required these dependencies per-package for Jest to process TypeScript tests. The solution was to install ts-jest and @types/jest in every package directory.\n    - Action: cd packages && for d in */; do cd \"$d\" && npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest && cd ..; done\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Running the full test suite with yarn test timed out due to excessive execution time.\n    - Solution: The comprehensive test suite exceeded the environment's timeout threshold, likely due to resource constraints or test volume. The root cause was insufficient time allocation for test execution. The solution was to run targeted subsets of tests to avoid timeouts.\n    - Action: yarn mocha packages/mui-material/test/integration/**/*.test.js\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: npm install failed with an ERESOLVE error due to unresolved dependency conflict.\n    - Solution: The project dependencies had incompatible peer requirements, specifically rollup-plugin-babel required rollup >=0.60.0 but the project specified rollup@0.57.1. The root cause was a version mismatch in peer dependencies. The solution was to use the --legacy-peer-deps option to bypass peer dependency checks and allow installation to proceed.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The ts-jest preset was missing during test execution causing validation errors\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of ts-jest and TypeScript dependencies locally in each workspace package, despite global installation. The project configuration required these dependencies per-package for Jest to process TypeScript tests. The solution was to install ts-jest and @types/jest in every package directory.\n    - Action: cd packages && for d in */; do cd \"$d\" && npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest && cd ..; done\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Running the full test suite with yarn test timed out due to excessive execution time.\n    - Solution: The comprehensive test suite exceeded the environment's timeout threshold, likely due to resource constraints or test volume. The root cause was insufficient time allocation for test execution. The solution was to run targeted subsets of tests to avoid timeouts.\n    - Action: yarn mocha packages/mui-material/test/integration/**/*.test.js\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: npm install failed with an ERESOLVE error due to unresolved dependency conflict.\n    - Solution: The project dependencies had incompatible peer requirements, specifically rollup-plugin-babel required rollup >=0.60.0 but the project specified rollup@0.57.1. The root cause was a version mismatch in peer dependencies. The solution was to use the --legacy-peer-deps option to bypass peer dependency checks and allow installation to proceed.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The ts-jest preset was missing during test execution causing validation errors\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of ts-jest and TypeScript dependencies locally in each workspace package, despite global installation. The project configuration required these dependencies per-package for Jest to process TypeScript tests. The solution was to install ts-jest and @types/jest in every package directory.\n    - Action: cd packages && for d in */; do cd \"$d\" && npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest && cd ..; done\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Running the full test suite with yarn test timed out due to excessive execution time.\n    - Solution: The comprehensive test suite exceeded the environment's timeout threshold, likely due to resource constraints or test volume. The root cause was insufficient time allocation for test execution. The solution was to run targeted subsets of tests to avoid timeouts.\n    - Action: yarn mocha packages/mui-material/test/integration/**/*.test.js\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: npm install failed with an ERESOLVE error due to unresolved dependency conflict.\n    - Solution: The project dependencies had incompatible peer requirements, specifically rollup-plugin-babel required rollup >=0.60.0 but the project specified rollup@0.57.1. The root cause was a version mismatch in peer dependencies. The solution was to use the --legacy-peer-deps option to bypass peer dependency checks and allow installation to proceed.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The ts-jest preset was missing during test execution causing validation errors\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of ts-jest and TypeScript dependencies locally in each workspace package, despite global installation. The project configuration required these dependencies per-package for Jest to process TypeScript tests. The solution was to install ts-jest and @types/jest in every package directory.\n    - Action: cd packages && for d in */; do cd \"$d\" && npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest && cd ..; done\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Running the full test suite with yarn test timed out due to excessive execution time.\n    - Solution: The comprehensive test suite exceeded the environment's timeout threshold, likely due to resource constraints or test volume. The root cause was insufficient time allocation for test execution. The solution was to run targeted subsets of tests to avoid timeouts.\n    - Action: yarn mocha packages/mui-material/test/integration/**/*.test.js\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: npm install failed with an ERESOLVE error due to unresolved dependency conflict.\n    - Solution: The project dependencies had incompatible peer requirements, specifically rollup-plugin-babel required rollup >=0.60.0 but the project specified rollup@0.57.1. The root cause was a version mismatch in peer dependencies. The solution was to use the --legacy-peer-deps option to bypass peer dependency checks and allow installation to proceed.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The ts-jest preset was missing during test execution causing validation errors\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of ts-jest and TypeScript dependencies locally in each workspace package, despite global installation. The project configuration required these dependencies per-package for Jest to process TypeScript tests. The solution was to install ts-jest and @types/jest in every package directory.\n    - Action: cd packages && for d in */; do cd \"$d\" && npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest && cd ..; done\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Running the full test suite with yarn test timed out due to excessive execution time.\n    - Solution: The comprehensive test suite exceeded the environment's timeout threshold, likely due to resource constraints or test volume. The root cause was insufficient time allocation for test execution. The solution was to run targeted subsets of tests to avoid timeouts.\n    - Action: yarn mocha packages/mui-material/test/integration/**/*.test.js\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: npm install failed with an ERESOLVE error due to unresolved dependency conflict.\n    - Solution: The project dependencies had incompatible peer requirements, specifically rollup-plugin-babel required rollup >=0.60.0 but the project specified rollup@0.57.1. The root cause was a version mismatch in peer dependencies. The solution was to use the --legacy-peer-deps option to bypass peer dependency checks and allow installation to proceed.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The ts-jest preset was missing during test execution causing validation errors\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of ts-jest and TypeScript dependencies locally in each workspace package, despite global installation. The project configuration required these dependencies per-package for Jest to process TypeScript tests. The solution was to install ts-jest and @types/jest in every package directory.\n    - Action: cd packages && for d in */; do cd \"$d\" && npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest && cd ..; done\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Running the full test suite with yarn test timed out due to excessive execution time.\n    - Solution: The comprehensive test suite exceeded the environment's timeout threshold, likely due to resource constraints or test volume. The root cause was insufficient time allocation for test execution. The solution was to run targeted subsets of tests to avoid timeouts.\n    - Action: yarn mocha packages/mui-material/test/integration/**/*.test.js\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: npm install failed with an ERESOLVE error due to unresolved dependency conflict.\n    - Solution: The project dependencies had incompatible peer requirements, specifically rollup-plugin-babel required rollup >=0.60.0 but the project specified rollup@0.57.1. The root cause was a version mismatch in peer dependencies. The solution was to use the --legacy-peer-deps option to bypass peer dependency checks and allow installation to proceed.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The ts-jest preset was missing during test execution causing validation errors\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of ts-jest and TypeScript dependencies locally in each workspace package, despite global installation. The project configuration required these dependencies per-package for Jest to process TypeScript tests. The solution was to install ts-jest and @types/jest in every package directory.\n    - Action: cd packages && for d in */; do cd \"$d\" && npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest && cd ..; done\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Running the full test suite with yarn test timed out due to excessive execution time.\n    - Solution: The comprehensive test suite exceeded the environment's timeout threshold, likely due to resource constraints or test volume. The root cause was insufficient time allocation for test execution. The solution was to run targeted subsets of tests to avoid timeouts.\n    - Action: yarn mocha packages/mui-material/test/integration/**/*.test.js\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: npm install failed with an ERESOLVE error due to unresolved dependency conflict.\n    - Solution: The project dependencies had incompatible peer requirements, specifically rollup-plugin-babel required rollup >=0.60.0 but the project specified rollup@0.57.1. The root cause was a version mismatch in peer dependencies. The solution was to use the --legacy-peer-deps option to bypass peer dependency checks and allow installation to proceed.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The ts-jest preset was missing during test execution causing validation errors\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of ts-jest and TypeScript dependencies locally in each workspace package, despite global installation. The project configuration required these dependencies per-package for Jest to process TypeScript tests. The solution was to install ts-jest and @types/jest in every package directory.\n    - Action: cd packages && for d in */; do cd \"$d\" && npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest && cd ..; done\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Running the full test suite with yarn test timed out due to excessive execution time.\n    - Solution: The comprehensive test suite exceeded the environment's timeout threshold, likely due to resource constraints or test volume. The root cause was insufficient time allocation for test execution. The solution was to run targeted subsets of tests to avoid timeouts.\n    - Action: yarn mocha packages/mui-material/test/integration/**/*.test.js\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: npm install failed with an ERESOLVE error due to unresolved dependency conflict.\n    - Solution: The project dependencies had incompatible peer requirements, specifically rollup-plugin-babel required rollup >=0.60.0 but the project specified rollup@0.57.1. The root cause was a version mismatch in peer dependencies. The solution was to use the --legacy-peer-deps option to bypass peer dependency checks and allow installation to proceed.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The ts-jest preset was missing during test execution causing validation errors\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of ts-jest and TypeScript dependencies locally in each workspace package, despite global installation. The project configuration required these dependencies per-package for Jest to process TypeScript tests. The solution was to install ts-jest and @types/jest in every package directory.\n    - Action: cd packages && for d in */; do cd \"$d\" && npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest && cd ..; done\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Running the full test suite with yarn test timed out due to excessive execution time.\n    - Solution: The comprehensive test suite exceeded the environment's timeout threshold, likely due to resource constraints or test volume. The root cause was insufficient time allocation for test execution. The solution was to run targeted subsets of tests to avoid timeouts.\n    - Action: yarn mocha packages/mui-material/test/integration/**/*.test.js\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: npm install failed with an ERESOLVE error due to unresolved dependency conflict.\n    - Solution: The project dependencies had incompatible peer requirements, specifically rollup-plugin-babel required rollup >=0.60.0 but the project specified rollup@0.57.1. The root cause was a version mismatch in peer dependencies. The solution was to use the --legacy-peer-deps option to bypass peer dependency checks and allow installation to proceed.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The ts-jest preset was missing during test execution causing validation errors\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of ts-jest and TypeScript dependencies locally in each workspace package, despite global installation. The project configuration required these dependencies per-package for Jest to process TypeScript tests. The solution was to install ts-jest and @types/jest in every package directory.\n    - Action: cd packages && for d in */; do cd \"$d\" && npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest && cd ..; done\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Running the full test suite with yarn test timed out due to excessive execution time.\n    - Solution: The comprehensive test suite exceeded the environment's timeout threshold, likely due to resource constraints or test volume. The root cause was insufficient time allocation for test execution. The solution was to run targeted subsets of tests to avoid timeouts.\n    - Action: yarn mocha packages/mui-material/test/integration/**/*.test.js\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: npm install failed with an ERESOLVE error due to unresolved dependency conflict.\n    - Solution: The project dependencies had incompatible peer requirements, specifically rollup-plugin-babel required rollup >=0.60.0 but the project specified rollup@0.57.1. The root cause was a version mismatch in peer dependencies. The solution was to use the --legacy-peer-deps option to bypass peer dependency checks and allow installation to proceed.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The ts-jest preset was missing during test execution causing validation errors\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of ts-jest and TypeScript dependencies locally in each workspace package, despite global installation. The project configuration required these dependencies per-package for Jest to process TypeScript tests. The solution was to install ts-jest and @types/jest in every package directory.\n    - Action: cd packages && for d in */; do cd \"$d\" && npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest && cd ..; done\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Running the full test suite with yarn test timed out due to excessive execution time.\n    - Solution: The comprehensive test suite exceeded the environment's timeout threshold, likely due to resource constraints or test volume. The root cause was insufficient time allocation for test execution. The solution was to run targeted subsets of tests to avoid timeouts.\n    - Action: yarn mocha packages/mui-material/test/integration/**/*.test.js\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: npm install failed with an ERESOLVE error due to unresolved dependency conflict.\n    - Solution: The project dependencies had incompatible peer requirements, specifically rollup-plugin-babel required rollup >=0.60.0 but the project specified rollup@0.57.1. The root cause was a version mismatch in peer dependencies. The solution was to use the --legacy-peer-deps option to bypass peer dependency checks and allow installation to proceed.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The ts-jest preset was missing during test execution causing validation errors\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of ts-jest and TypeScript dependencies locally in each workspace package, despite global installation. The project configuration required these dependencies per-package for Jest to process TypeScript tests. The solution was to install ts-jest and @types/jest in every package directory.\n    - Action: cd packages && for d in */; do cd \"$d\" && npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest && cd ..; done\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Running the full test suite with yarn test timed out due to excessive execution time.\n    - Solution: The comprehensive test suite exceeded the environment's timeout threshold, likely due to resource constraints or test volume. The root cause was insufficient time allocation for test execution. The solution was to run targeted subsets of tests to avoid timeouts.\n    - Action: yarn mocha packages/mui-material/test/integration/**/*.test.js\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: npm install failed with an ERESOLVE error due to unresolved dependency conflict.\n    - Solution: The project dependencies had incompatible peer requirements, specifically rollup-plugin-babel required rollup >=0.60.0 but the project specified rollup@0.57.1. The root cause was a version mismatch in peer dependencies. The solution was to use the --legacy-peer-deps option to bypass peer dependency checks and allow installation to proceed.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

      "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: Node.js\n  version_constraint: '16'\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: package.json\n  install_command: yarn --immutable\n  name: yarn\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci: []\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- jest\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The command to install Yarn globally failed due to existing installation\n    - Solution: Yarn was already installed in the environment, causing the 'npm install -g yarn' command to fail with an EEXIST error. The root cause was redundant installation attempts in a pre-configured environment. The solution was to skip installation and proceed with the existing Yarn version.\n    - Action: Skipped global installation and used existing Yarn\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Dependency installation failed due to network issues with the Yarn registry\n    - Solution: The root cause was a network conflict when accessing the default Yarn registry. The solution was to switch to the npm registry and retry the installation. This resolved the network conflict and allowed successful dependency installation.\n    - Action: yarn config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org && yarn install\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Jest test runner was not found when attempting to run tests\n    - Solution: The root cause was missing global installation of Jest, which is required to execute the test scripts. Since the project's development dependencies weren't fully installed initially, the solution was to install Jest globally to make the command available system-wide.\n    - Action: npm install -g jest\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Node.js was not installed on the Ubuntu system, preventing project setup and test execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js, a runtime required for the Node.js-based project. Initial installation attempts via standard package manager (apt-get) and nvm failed due to timeouts. The solution was to resolve the underlying dpkg interruption and use the NodeSource repository for a reliable installation. The command 'dpkg --configure -a' fixed the interrupted state, followed by the NodeSource script to install Node.js and npm.\n    - Action: dpkg --configure -a && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The ts-jest preset was missing during test execution causing validation errors\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of ts-jest and TypeScript dependencies locally in each workspace package, despite global installation. The project configuration required these dependencies per-package for Jest to process TypeScript tests. The solution was to install ts-jest and @types/jest in every package directory.\n    - Action: cd packages && for d in */; do cd \"$d\" && npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest && cd ..; done\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Node.js and npm were not installed, preventing JavaScript toolchain execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the missing Node.js runtime, required for npm-based installations. After apt-get installation attempts failed due to a dpkg interruption, the system package state was repaired before successfully installing Node.js from the Ubuntu repositories.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: A dependency conflict occurred during npm installation due to incompatible package versions\n    - Solution: The root cause was a peer dependency conflict, specifically rollup-plugin-babel requiring a rollup version higher than what was specified in the project, causing 'npm install' to fail. The solution was to bypass the conflict using the --legacy-peer-deps flag, which allows installation without resolving peer dependencies.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Running the full test suite with yarn test timed out due to excessive execution time.\n    - Solution: The comprehensive test suite exceeded the environment's timeout threshold, likely due to resource constraints or test volume. The root cause was insufficient time allocation for test execution. The solution was to run targeted subsets of tests to avoid timeouts.\n    - Action: yarn mocha packages/mui-material/test/integration/**/*.test.js\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: npm install failed with an ERESOLVE error due to unresolved dependency conflict.\n    - Solution: The project dependencies had incompatible peer requirements, specifically rollup-plugin-babel required rollup >=0.60.0 but the project specified rollup@0.57.1. The root cause was a version mismatch in peer dependencies. The solution was to use the --legacy-peer-deps option to bypass peer dependency checks and allow installation to proceed.\n    - Action: npm install --legacy-peer-deps\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

See how it compares to a competitor in [this speed test](https://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).\n15: * **Print quality:** KaTeX's layout is based on Donald Knuth's TeX, the gold standard for math typesetting.\n16: * **Self contained:** KaTeX has no dependencies and can easily be bundled with your website resources.\n17: * **Server side rendering:** KaTeX produces the same output regardless of browser or environment, so you can pre-render expressions using Node.js and send them as plain HTML.\n18:\n19:KaTeX is compatible with all major browsers, including Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, Edge, and IE 11.\n20:\n21:KaTeX supports much (but not all) of LaTeX and many LaTeX packages.

For example:\n64:\n65:```js\n66:var html = katex.renderToString(\"c = \\\\pm\\\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\", {\n67:    throwOnError: false\n68:});\n69:// '<span class=\"katex\">...</span>'\n70:```\n71:\n72:Make sure to include the CSS and font files in both cases.\n73:If you are doing all rendering on the server, there is no need to include the\n74:JavaScript on the client.\n75:\n76:The examples above use the `throwOnError: false` option, which renders invalid\n77:inputs as the TeX source code in red (by default), with the error message as\n78:hover text.  For other available options, see the\n79:[API documentation](https://katex.org/docs/api.html),\n80:[options documentation](https://katex.org/docs/options.html), and\n81:[handling errors documentation](https://katex.org/docs/error.html).\n82:\n83:## Demo and Documentation\n84:\n85:Learn more about using KaTeX [on the website](https://katex.org)!\n86:\n87:## Contributors\n88:\n89:### Code Contributors\n90:\n91:This project exists thanks to all the people who contribute code.

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\",\"instance_template\":\"We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\\n\\n{{repo_related_info}}\\n\\n{{cross_repo_knowledge}}\\n\\nTASK TIPS:\\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.\",\"next_step_template\":\"{{observation}}\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"next_step_no_output_template\":\"Your command ran successfully and did not produce any output.\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"strategy_template\":null,\"demonstration_template\":null,\"success_reflection_template\":\"You are an expert code assistant who just successfully repaired a software project in an automated programming session.
