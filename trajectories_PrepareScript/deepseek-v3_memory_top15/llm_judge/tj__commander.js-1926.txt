"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed with all 99 test suites passing and 1073 tests completed. The output shows a complete test report structure with coverage metrics, confirming that the test framework (Jest) ran to completion without any critical failures.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project's main modules were successfully imported and used during the test execution. The test results indicate that the core functionality is working as expected, with all tests passing. Additionally, the project's dependencies were correctly installed using `npm ci`, and the Node.js version (`v16.20.2`) met the project's requirements (`>=16`).\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria: the test suite completed successfully, and the core functionality was verified."
