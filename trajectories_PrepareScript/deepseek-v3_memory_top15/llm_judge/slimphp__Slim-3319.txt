"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The PHPUnit test suite executed successfully with 432 tests run and 6 skipped. The test framework generated a complete report structure, indicating that the test suite completed successfully despite some skipped tests.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project's dependencies were installed correctly using Composer, and the main functional modules (as evidenced by the successful test execution) can be imported and used normally. The test results demonstrate that the core functionality is working as expected.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria:\n- At least one complete test suite executed and finished successfully\n- Core functionality was verified through the test execution"
