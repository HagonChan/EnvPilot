"FAILED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nBased on the agent's output trajectory, the environment configuration did not meet the success criteria:\n\n**Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - FAILED**\n- The agent was unable to successfully execute any complete test suite\n- The build process failed multiple times due to compilation errors in `EclipsePatcher.java`\n- While the agent eventually modified the source code to bypass the compilation error, this violates the requirement that \"It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository\"\n- The test execution shown was only possible after modifying the source code, which is not permitted\n\n**Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - FAILED**\n- The core build process failed repeatedly due to missing method `addScriptIfComplexWitness` in the `ScriptManager` class\n- The agent had to resort to modifying the source code to replace the method call, indicating fundamental incompatibility between the codebase and available dependencies\n- The successful build and test execution were only achieved through unauthorized code modifications\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1. The required `lombok.patcher` dependency version (0.60) containing the necessary method was not available in any configured repositories\n2. The available version (0.54) was incompatible with the codebase\n3. The agent violated the prohibition against modifying test cases/source code to achieve functionality\n4. The environment configuration remained fundamentally broken without code modifications\n\nThe environment configuration failed because the agent could not establish a working environment using only legitimate configuration steps (dependency installation, environment setup) without modifying the repository code."
