"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed using `minirake test`, completing with 959 passing tests and 0 failures. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, including the number of tests, passes, and skips.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project was successfully built from source, and the main functional modules (e.g., `mruby`, `mirb`, `mrbc`) were compiled and verified. The core functionality was demonstrated through the execution of the test suite, which confirmed that the basic API calls and features are working as expected.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria, as the test suite completed successfully and the core functionality was verified. The agent successfully resolved compatibility issues with Ruby 3.0.2 by updating the `Rakefile` syntax, ensuring the project could be built and tested."
