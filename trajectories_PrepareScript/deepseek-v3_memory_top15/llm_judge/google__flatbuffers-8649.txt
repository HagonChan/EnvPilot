"PASSED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nBased on the agent's output trajectory, the environment configuration successfully meets both success criteria:\n\n**Condition 1: Test Suite Execution ✓**\n- The test suite `./flattests` executed completely and finished successfully\n- All tests passed as indicated by the output \"ALL TESTS PASSED\"\n- The testing framework generated a complete test report structure (implied by the comprehensive test execution)\n\n**Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification ✓**\n- The project was successfully built using CMake and Make\n- Core modules were compiled without errors (flatbuffers library, flatc compiler, test executables)\n- The main functional components (flatc compiler, test executables) were created and are operational\n- The test execution demonstrates that core features are working correctly\n\n**Key Success Indicators:**\n- CMake configuration completed successfully with GNU 11.4.0 compiler\n- Make build completed without errors (100% built targets)\n- Test suite execution completed with all tests passing\n- No critical errors encountered during compilation or execution\n- The agent followed the CI/CD configuration from the repository's build.yml file\n\nThe environment configuration is successful because both the test framework operates correctly and the core functionality is verified through successful compilation and test execution."
