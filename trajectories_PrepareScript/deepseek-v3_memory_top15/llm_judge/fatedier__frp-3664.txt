"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed using the `make gotest` command. Multiple test packages were run, with some packages having no test files and others passing their tests. The test framework generated complete test reports with coverage statistics, meeting the success criteria for test suite execution.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The environment was correctly configured with Go 1.21, and all dependencies were installed using `go mod download`. The core functionality was verified by successfully running the test suite, which included tests for various packages in the project. The main functional modules were imported and used normally, and the basic API calls returned expected results.\n\nBoth conditions for successful environment configuration were met: the test suite completed execution, and the core functionality was verified."
