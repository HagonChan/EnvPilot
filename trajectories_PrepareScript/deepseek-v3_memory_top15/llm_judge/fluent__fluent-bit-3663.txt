"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully built and executed multiple test suites (e.g., `flb-it-parser`, `flb-it-record_accessor`). These tests completed successfully, generating output that confirmed all unit tests passed. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent verified core functionality by building the project from source, resolving build issues (e.g., disabling `-Werror` for `mbedtls`), and running example executables (e.g., `fluent-bit`). The successful execution of test suites and core binaries demonstrates that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally, meeting Condition 2.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful as both critical conditions are satisfied: test suites executed fully, and core functionality was verified. The agent addressed build failures and ensured the project's test framework operated correctly."
