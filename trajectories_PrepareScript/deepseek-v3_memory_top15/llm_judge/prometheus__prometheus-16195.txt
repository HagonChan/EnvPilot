"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed using `go test ./...`. Multiple test packages completed successfully (e.g., `github.com/prometheus/prometheus/cmd/prometheus`, `github.com/prometheus/prometheus/config`, etc.), and the output shows a complete test report structure with \"ok\" status for all test packages that had tests. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The environment was properly configured with Go 1.23.4, matching the project's requirements. Dependencies were successfully downloaded using `go mod download`, and core modules were imported and tested without errors. The test results confirm that the main functional modules are operational, meeting Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful as both conditions are satisfied: the test suite completed execution, and core functionality was verified."
