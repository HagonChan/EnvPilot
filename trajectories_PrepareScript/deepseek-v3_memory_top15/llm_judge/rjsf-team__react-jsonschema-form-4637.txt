"PASSED\n1. Test Suite Execution: The test suite completed successfully for all 13 projects after building the internal packages. While there were initial failures due to missing built dependencies, running the build command resolved these issues. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, and the tests executed to completion, meeting Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n\n2. Core Functionality Verification: The core functionality was verified through the successful execution of the build process for all internal packages. The project's main modules were built and could be imported normally, as evidenced by the subsequent successful test execution. This meets Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful because both conditions were met: the test suite completed execution and the core functionality was verified. The initial test failures were due to missing built dependencies, not fundamental issues with the environment configuration, and were resolved by building the packages before running the tests."
