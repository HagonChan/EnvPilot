"PASSED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n**Condition 1: Test Suite Execution** ✓\n- **Java Test Suite**: The Maven test suite (`mvn test`) executed successfully across all Java modules (libphonenumber, prefixmapper, carrier, geocoder, demo), completing with \"BUILD SUCCESS\" and generating proper test reports\n- **C++ Test Suite**: Both C++ test executables ran successfully:\n  - `generate_geocoding_data_test`: 2 tests from 1 test suite passed\n  - `libphonenumber_test`: 326 tests from 16 test suites passed with complete test reporting structure\n- Testing frameworks (Maven for Java, Google Test for C++) started, executed, and finished normally\n\n**Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification** ✓\n- **Java Modules**: All core Java modules (libphonenumber, prefixmapper, carrier, geocoder) were successfully built and installed via Maven, indicating they can be imported and used normally\n- **C++ Library**: The C++ library was successfully built with CMake/Make, producing functional test executables that demonstrate core API functionality\n- **Build System Integration**: Both Maven and CMake build systems operated correctly, compiling source code and producing expected artifacts\n\n**Success Criteria Met**:\n- ✅ At least one complete test suite executed successfully (both Java and C++ test suites completed)\n- ✅ Testing frameworks generated complete test report structures\n- ✅ Core functional modules can be imported and used (successful builds indicate functional APIs)\n- ✅ Basic API functionality demonstrated through test execution\n\nThe environment configuration is successful as both Java and C++ components are fully functional with complete test suite execution and core functionality verification."
