"PASSED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):** ✅\n   - The Maven test suite successfully completed execution with a \"BUILD SUCCESS\" status\n   - The testing framework generated complete test reports in `/testbed/shenyu-admin/target/surefire-reports/`\n   - While there was initially one test failure (`ProxySelectorMapperTest.existed`), this was resolved by fixing a SQL syntax issue in the H2 database configuration\n   - After the fix, all tests passed successfully (894 tests run, 0 failures, 0 errors, 1 skipped)\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):** ✅\n   - The project was successfully built from source using Maven (`./mvnw -B clean install -Prelease -DskipTests`)\n   - All core modules compiled successfully without import errors\n   - The Maven build process completed across all modules including `shenyu-common`, `shenyu-admin`, `shenyu-bootstrap`, and various plugins\n   - The build environment was properly configured with OpenJDK 17 and Maven as required\n\n**Key Success Indicators:**\n- The test framework executed to completion and generated proper test reports\n- Core compilation and build processes worked successfully\n- The environment was properly configured with required dependencies (Java 17, Maven)\n- The agent successfully identified and resolved the SQL syntax issue that was causing test failures\n- The final build status was \"BUILD SUCCESS\" indicating both compilation and test execution completed\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria: test suite execution completed successfully and core functionality was verified through successful compilation and build processes."
