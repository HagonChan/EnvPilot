"PASSED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n**Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - SUCCESS**\n- The agent successfully executed `cargo test` which ran multiple test suites including unit tests, integration tests, and documentation tests\n- The test framework generated a complete test report structure showing:\n  - 223 tests passed in the core module\n  - 12 doc-tests passed for rocket_sync_db_pools\n  - 14 doc-tests passed for rocket_ws\n  - All tests completed successfully with \"ok\" results\n- The test execution finished normally without any framework-level failures\n\n**Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - SUCCESS**\n- The project was successfully built using `cargo build` with only minor warnings (unused variables, dead code)\n- Core modules compiled without critical errors or import failures\n- The Rust toolchain (rustc 1.89.0, cargo 1.89.0) was properly installed and configured\n- All system dependencies (libmysqlclient-dev, libpq-dev, libsqlite3-dev, gcc, make, pkg-config, libssl-dev) were installed successfully\n- The build process completed successfully, indicating core functionality is intact\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria. The test suite executed completely and generated proper test reports, while the core functionality was verified through successful compilation and build processes. The agent successfully resolved network connectivity issues with the Rust toolchain installation and properly configured all required system dependencies."
