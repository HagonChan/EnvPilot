"FAILED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nBased on the agent's output trajectory, the environment configuration does not meet the success criteria for the following reasons:\n\n**Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - PARTIALLY MET**\n- The test suite did execute and complete, generating a test report structure\n- 50 tests passed successfully, indicating the testing framework is operational\n- However, 6 tests failed due to missing `fuel-core` binary dependency\n\n**Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - NOT MET**\n- The core `forc` tool was successfully built and installed from source\n- However, the missing `fuel-core` dependency prevents proper verification of core functionality\n- The test failures indicate that fundamental operations (contract calls, transfers, function listing) cannot execute properly without `fuel-core`\n- The agent was unable to install `fuel-core` due to network connectivity issues\n\n**Critical Failure Point:**\nThe absence of `fuel-core` represents a critical missing dependency that prevents the complete verification of core functionality. While the Rust environment was successfully configured and the project built correctly, the inability to install this essential component means the environment cannot be considered fully operational for the intended use case.\n\nThe environment configuration is incomplete due to the missing `fuel-core` dependency, which is required for proper test execution and core functionality verification."
