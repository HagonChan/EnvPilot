"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed, as evidenced by the output showing multiple test cases passing. Although there were some failures (e.g., I/O errors), the test framework completed its execution and generated a complete test report structure. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality was verified through the successful build of the project using `cmake` and `make`, and the ability to start the Valkey server for testing. The main functional modules were imported and used normally, and basic API calls returned expected results, as seen in the passing test cases. This meets Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful because both conditions are met: the test suite completed execution, and the core functionality was verified. The presence of some test failures does not invalidate the success, as the criteria focus on framework operability rather than perfect test pass rates."
