"FAILED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nBased on the agent's trajectory, the environment configuration does not meet the success criteria:\n\n**Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - FAILED**\n- The Gradle build process completed execution (494 tasks executed)\n- However, the test suite failed with 2 test failures and 3 ignored tests\n- The build was marked as \"FAILED\" due to these test failures\n- While individual test failures are acceptable per the criteria, the overall test suite did not complete successfully (Gradle reports BUILD FAILED)\n\n**Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - PARTIAL SUCCESS**\n- The Gradle wrapper was successfully configured and executed\n- Java 17 and Java 8 were properly installed\n- System dependencies (graphviz, curl, unzip) were installed\n- The build process ran and completed many tasks\n- However, the test failures indicate potential issues with core functionality, particularly around Gradle wrapper behavior and Maven starter project verification\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1. The Gradle wrapper test failure suggests the local distribution setup may have broken expected wrapper behavior\n2. The Maven starter test failure indicates potential integration issues\n3. The build was ultimately marked as failed, preventing successful test suite completion\n\nWhile the environment was largely configured correctly and many tests passed (117/119), the critical test failures and overall build failure status mean the environment configuration does not fully meet the success criteria."
