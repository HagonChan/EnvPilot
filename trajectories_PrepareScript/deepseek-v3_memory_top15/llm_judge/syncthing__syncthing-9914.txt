"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite completed successfully with all tests passing (`ok` status for all test packages). The output shows that multiple test packages were executed, and the test framework generated a complete test report structure. This meets Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The build process (`go run build.go`) completed without errors, and core modules were successfully imported and used during the test execution. The test output confirms that the main functional modules (e.g., `lib/api`, `lib/model`, `lib/fs`) were tested and operational. This meets Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe environment was correctly configured with Go 1.23.0, necessary system dependencies (`gcc`, `git`, `make`), and project dependencies (`go mod download`). The test suite executed fully, and core functionality was verified, fulfilling both success criteria."
