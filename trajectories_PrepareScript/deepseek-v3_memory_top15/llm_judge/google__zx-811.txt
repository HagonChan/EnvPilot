"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite completed successfully with all tests passing after resolving environment issues. The test framework generated a complete test report structure showing 117 passed tests and 0 failures. The agent installed necessary dependencies (Node.js 20.x, netcat) and configured the environment correctly to support the test execution.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules were successfully imported and used. The core functionality was demonstrated through the execution of test cases, including API calls and script execution. The project built successfully (`npm run build`) and all test categories (unit tests, type checks, license checks) completed without critical errors.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria:\n- At least one complete test suite executed and finished successfully\n- Core functionality was verified through test execution and module imports"
