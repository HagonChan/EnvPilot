"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed the test suite (`npm run test-unit`), which ran 62 test suites with 1637 tests passing and 2 skipped. The test framework (Jest) generated a complete test report structure, confirming that the test suite completed successfully despite some minor warnings about open handles.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent verified that the main functional modules could be imported and used normally by successfully installing dependencies (`npm ci`) and running the test suite. The core functionality was demonstrated through the execution of numerous unit tests across different packages in the monorepo.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria: the test suite completed successfully, and core functionality was verified through test execution. The minor warnings about deprecated packages and vulnerabilities do not affect the fundamental operability of the environment."
