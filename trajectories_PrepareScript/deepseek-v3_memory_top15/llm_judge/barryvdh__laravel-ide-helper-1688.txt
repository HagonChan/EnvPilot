"FAILED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nBased on the agent's output trajectory, the environment configuration does not meet both success criteria:\n\n**Condition 1: Test Suite Execution** ❌\n- The test suite did execute and complete (PHPUnit ran 74 tests)\n- However, there were 49 failures initially, which were reduced to 8 failures after snapshot regeneration\n- While individual test failures are acceptable under the success criteria, the sheer number of failures (8 remaining) suggests fundamental issues with the environment setup or dependency compatibility\n\n**Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification** ❌\n- The agent successfully installed PHP 8.2 with required extensions (pdo_sqlite, fileinfo, curl, xml, mbstring)\n- Composer dependencies were installed successfully\n- However, the core functionality verification cannot be confirmed as the agent did not demonstrate:\n  - Importing and using main functional modules\n  - Basic API calls returning expected results\n  - Core features demonstrated through example code execution\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1. The test failures indicate significant compatibility issues between the installed dependencies (Laravel 11.45.2, PHPUnit 10.5.53) and the expected test outputs\n2. The agent focused primarily on test execution but did not verify core functionality beyond the test framework\n3. The remaining 8 test failures after snapshot regeneration suggest persistent environment/dependency compatibility problems\n\nThe environment configuration cannot be considered successful because while the test framework executed, the high failure rate and lack of core functionality verification indicate the environment is not properly configured for reliable operation."
