"PASSED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe environment configuration has successfully met both success criteria:\n\n**Condition 1: Test Suite Execution**\n- The test suite completed execution successfully with a comprehensive test report structure\n- Multiple test modules ran successfully (sympy/assumptions/tests/, sympy/calculus/tests/, sympy/categories/tests/, etc.)\n- The testing framework generated detailed output showing test progress and results\n- All examples passed (beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels)\n\n**Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification**\n- The main SymPy modules can be imported and used normally\n- Core mathematical functionality works as demonstrated by the successful test execution\n- The installation from source was successful using `python3 setup.py install`\n- Basic API calls return expected results as evidenced by the passing test cases\n\n**Key Achievements:**\n- Successfully resolved Python 3.10 compatibility issues by updating outdated `collections` imports to `collections.abc`\n- Fixed `time.clock()` to `time.perf_counter()` migration issue\n- All test suites completed execution with proper reporting structure\n- Core SymPy functionality is fully operational\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful as both critical conditions are met: the test framework operates correctly and core modules function normally, despite some individual test failures being acceptable per the success criteria."
