"FAILED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nBased on the agent's trajectory, the environment configuration does not meet the success criteria:\n\n**Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - FAILED**\n- The agent ran `mvn test` which resulted in test failures and errors (2 failures, 2 errors out of 6007 tests)\n- The test suite did not complete successfully - Maven reported \"BUILD FAILURE\" due to test failures\n- The agent then used `-DskipTests` to bypass the test execution entirely, meaning no test suite was actually executed to completion\n\n**Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - PARTIAL SUCCESS**\n- The project was successfully built using `mvn package -DskipTests`, indicating core compilation works\n- However, the agent did not demonstrate core functionality verification through:\n  - Importing and using main functional modules\n  - Making basic API calls\n  - Executing example code to verify core features work\n\n**Critical Issue:** The agent skipped the test execution phase entirely rather than addressing the network/DNS issues that caused the test failures. While some tests failed due to environmental constraints (network connectivity), the agent should have attempted to run a subset of tests or verify core functionality directly rather than completely bypassing the testing requirement.\n\nThe environment configuration successfully installed Java and Maven, and the project builds, but the agent failed to demonstrate that tests can execute or that core functionality works as required by the success criteria."
