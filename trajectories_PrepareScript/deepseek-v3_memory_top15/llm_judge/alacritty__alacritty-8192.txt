"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully executed the test suite using `cargo test`. The output shows that all tests passed (127 in `alacritty_terminal`, 44 in `ref.rs`, and doc-tests), with no failures or ignored tests. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, meeting Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent built the project successfully with `cargo build` after resolving dependencies (Rust toolchain, system libraries like `fontconfig`). The successful test execution further confirms that core modules can be imported and used normally, as the tests exercise the main functional modules (e.g., terminal emulation, config handling). This meets Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe agent addressed all failures (missing Rust installation, version mismatch, system dependencies) and achieved a fully functional environment where both the test suite and core functionality work as expected."
