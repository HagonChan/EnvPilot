"PASSED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nBased on the agent's trajectory, the environment configuration successfully meets both success criteria:\n\n**Condition 1: Test Suite Execution ✓**\n- The agent successfully executed the complete test suite using Codeception (`vendor/bin/codecept run`)\n- All 208 unit tests passed with 1862 assertions\n- The testing framework generated a complete test report structure showing execution time (00:02.227) and memory usage (140.00 MB)\n- The test suite completed successfully without any framework-level failures\n\n**Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification ✓**\n- The agent successfully installed all project dependencies using Composer (`composer install --prefer-dist --no-progress`)\n- The autoload files were generated correctly, indicating core modules can be imported\n- The test execution itself demonstrates that core functionality is working, as the tests rely on importing and using the project's main modules\n- All tests passing indicates that basic API calls and core features are functioning as expected\n\n**Additional Success Indicators:**\n- The agent properly configured the required PHP environment (PHP 7.3 with necessary extensions: opcache, gd, zip, curl, dom, mbstring)\n- The dependency installation completed without errors\n- The test execution followed the repository's CI/CD configuration exactly as specified in the `.github/workflows/tests.yaml` file\n- No critical errors occurred during the entire setup process\n\nThe environment is fully configured and operational, meeting all the success criteria for both test suite execution and core functionality verification."
