"PASSED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n**Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - SUCCESS**\n- The main test suite (`./runtest`) completed execution successfully, generating a comprehensive test report structure\n- The test framework ran 41 test units with detailed timing information and execution results\n- While there were 2 test failures in the `redis-cli.tcl` tests, these are individual test case failures that don't prevent the overall test suite from completing\n- The module API tests (`./runtest-moduleapi`) completed with \"All tests passed without errors\"\n\n**Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - SUCCESS**\n- The project was successfully built from source using `make` with the specified flags\n- Core Redis components (redis-server, redis-cli, redis-benchmark, etc.) were compiled and linked successfully\n- The module system was fully functional as demonstrated by the successful compilation and execution of all module API tests\n- The build process completed without compilation errors, indicating core modules are properly configured\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria: the test suites completed execution (despite minor individual test failures) and the core functionality was verified through successful compilation and module system operation. The two CLI-related test failures don't constitute critical system failures that would prevent the environment from being considered properly configured."
