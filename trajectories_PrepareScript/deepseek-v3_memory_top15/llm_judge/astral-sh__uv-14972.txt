"FAILED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nBased on the agent's output trajectory, the environment configuration does not meet the success criteria for the following reasons:\n\n**Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - FAILED**\n- No complete test suite was able to start, execute, and finish successfully\n- The Rust test suite (`cargo test`) ran but resulted in 2087 failures out of 2154 tests\n- The Python test suite (`pytest`) failed during test collection with import errors for all test modules\n- No test framework generated a complete test report structure\n\n**Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - PARTIAL SUCCESS**\n- The main `uv` package was successfully built and installed from source using `maturin`\n- The core module (`uv`) can be imported and used normally (implied by successful installation)\n- However, the test failures and import errors indicate potential issues with the complete functionality\n\n**Key Issues:**\n1. The Rust test suite had an extremely high failure rate (2087/2154 tests failed)\n2. Python tests failed to collect due to missing dependencies and import issues\n3. The `built_by_uv` test module could not be properly imported despite multiple attempts\n4. While the core package was built successfully, the extensive test failures suggest potential runtime issues\n\nThe environment configuration process successfully installed system dependencies, Rust toolchain, and built the project, but the critical test execution requirement was not met."
