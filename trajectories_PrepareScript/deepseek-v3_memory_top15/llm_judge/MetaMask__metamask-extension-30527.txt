"PASSED\nDetailed reasoning:\n1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**:\n   - The test suite completed successfully with all 973 test suites passing (2 marked as todo). The Jest test framework generated a complete report structure.\n   - While there were initial timeout failures in 4 test cases, these were resolved by increasing timeout limits in the respective test files. The final run showed all tests passing.\n   - The test execution included unit tests, integration tests, and other test types as specified in the project's configuration.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**:\n   - The main functional modules were successfully imported and used during test execution.\n   - Core features were demonstrated through the extensive test suite execution, including API calls and component tests.\n   - The environment was properly configured with Node.js v22.13 and Yarn 4.5.1 as required by the project.\n\n3. **Success Criteria Met**:\n   - Both conditions are satisfied: \n     - At least one complete test suite executed successfully (in fact, all test suites passed)\n     - Core functionality was verified through test execution and module imports\n   - The agent successfully resolved installation issues and test failures without modifying test logic, only adjusting timeout configurations.\n\n4. **Non-critical Issues**:\n   - The electron package installation failure was non-critical as it didn't prevent test execution.\n   - Worker process warnings about improper teardown were non-blocking and didn't affect test results."
