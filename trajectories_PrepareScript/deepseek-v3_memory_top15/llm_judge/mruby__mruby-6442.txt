"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution (Condition 1)**: The test suite executed successfully with `rake -m test:run:serial`. The output shows:\n   - mrbtest completed with 1610/1618 tests passing (8 skipped)\n   - Bintest completed with 100/100 tests passing\n   - Both test suites generated complete reports with clear pass/fail/skip counts\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2)**: The environment setup demonstrates core functionality works because:\n   - Ruby and Rake were successfully installed and verified\n   - The build process completed without errors (compilation steps shown)\n   - Test execution proves basic functionality through the test suite\n\nThe environment meets both success criteria despite some skipped tests (which are non-critical as they're documented feature limitations). The agent properly configured all dependencies and the test framework executed to completion."
