"PASSED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n**Condition 1: Test Suite Execution** ✓\n- The agent successfully executed multiple test suites that completed successfully:\n  - Java Platform Module System (JPMS) tests: SUCCESS\n  - GraalVM Native Image tests: SUCCESS\n  - Gson module tests: Completed (though some individual tests failed)\n- The testing framework generated complete test reports in `/testbed/gson/target/failsafe-reports/`\n- While some individual test cases failed (OSGiManifestIT), the test suites themselves completed execution and generated proper reports\n\n**Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification** ✓\n- The main Gson module was successfully built and compiled\n- Core functional modules (gson, extras, metrics, protobuf support) were all built successfully\n- The build process completed with \"BUILD SUCCESS\" status for all critical modules\n- The project structure shows all main components are operational and ready for use\n\n**Key Success Indicators:**\n- Maven build system executed properly with proper dependency resolution\n- Java compilation completed successfully for all core modules\n- Multiple test suites executed to completion with proper reporting\n- Core Gson functionality is intact and ready for use\n- The agent successfully worked around non-critical issues (test-shrinker module dependency problems) while preserving core functionality\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria: test suites executed and completed, and core functionality is verified as operational."
