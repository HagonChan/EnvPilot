"PASSED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n**Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - SUCCESS**\n- The test suite completed execution successfully with 924 tests passing, 0 failed, 7 ignored, and 0 filtered out\n- The testing framework generated a complete test report structure showing all test results\n- Individual test failures that initially occurred (backticks::trailing_newlines_are_stripped and functions::env_var_functions) were resolved through proper environment configuration\n- The test suite finished in 1.27 seconds with a comprehensive summary\n\n**Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - SUCCESS**\n- The Rust project compiled successfully without critical errors\n- Core modules were imported and built normally (evidenced by the successful compilation)\n- The cargo test command executed the complete test suite, demonstrating that the main functional modules work correctly\n- The project's build system (Cargo) operated normally, downloading dependencies and compiling the codebase\n\n**Key Success Indicators:**\n- All 924 tests passed after resolving environment dependencies\n- The Rust toolchain (version 1.89.0) met the requirement (â‰¥1.77)\n- All system dependencies (ripgrep, shellcheck, build-essential, libssl-dev, pkg-config, python3) were properly installed\n- Environment variables required for testing (USER) were correctly set\n- The test framework executed to completion and produced a valid test report\n\nThe environment configuration successfully meets both success criteria: the test suite completed execution and core functionality is verified through comprehensive testing."
