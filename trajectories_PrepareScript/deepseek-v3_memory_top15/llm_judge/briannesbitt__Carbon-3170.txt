"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite successfully started, executed, and completed with a full test report. While there were 2 errors and 4 failures out of 5805 tests, the suite completed execution and generated a detailed report (Condition 1 met).\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules were successfully imported and used. The test execution demonstrates that core features are operational, despite some test failures (Condition 2 met).\n\nThe environment configuration is successful because:\n- The test framework (PHPUnit) executed completely, producing a valid test report\n- Core functionality was verified through test execution\n- All required dependencies were installed and configured\n- The test failures appear to be related to specific test cases rather than fundamental environment issues"
