"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite ran successfully with 177 out of 179 tests passing. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, and the suite completed execution despite two test failures (`cd.fish` and `path.fish`). This meets the success criterion of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully, even with some individual test failures.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project was successfully built using `cmake` and `make`, and the core functionality was verified through the execution of the test suite. The majority of the tests passed, indicating that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally, and basic API calls return expected results. The two failing tests do not indicate a fundamental break in core functionality.\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful because both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) are met. The two test failures are non-critical and do not prevent the overall success of the environment setup."
