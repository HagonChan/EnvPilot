"PASSED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nBased on the agent's output trajectory, the environment configuration successfully meets both success criteria:\n\n**Condition 1: Test Suite Execution ✓**\n- The agent successfully executed `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast` which ran multiple test suites across the workspace\n- The test framework generated complete test reports showing:\n  - Multiple unit test suites executed (typst, typst-library, typst-syntax, etc.)\n  - Documentation tests ran successfully\n  - All tests completed with \"test result: ok\" status\n  - No test framework failures or execution errors\n\n**Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification ✓**\n- The Rust project compiled successfully without import errors\n- All crates in the workspace built properly (typst, typst-library, typst-syntax, etc.)\n- The cargo build system operated normally, fetching dependencies and compiling the project\n- The extensive test execution demonstrates that core modules are functional and API calls work as expected\n\n**Key Success Indicators:**\n- Rust toolchain 1.88.0 was correctly installed and configured\n- Required system dependencies (gcc-multilib, libssl-dev, pkg-config, gcc) were installed\n- The test suite completed execution with comprehensive test reporting\n- No critical errors occurred during compilation or test execution\n- The agent successfully submitted the configuration, indicating all requirements were met\n\nThe environment is properly configured for both testing and core functionality, meeting the success criteria despite some individual test cases being ignored (which is acceptable per the criteria)."
