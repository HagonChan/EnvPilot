"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully with `cargo test --locked`, completing all tests and generating a test report. All tests passed, including unit tests and doc-tests.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules were imported and used normally, as evidenced by the successful execution of the test suite and the example code in the `remove-emphasis` and `nop-preprocessor` examples. The core functionality was demonstrated through the test execution.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria:\n- The test suite completed successfully (Condition 1)\n- Core functionality was verified through test execution (Condition 2)"
