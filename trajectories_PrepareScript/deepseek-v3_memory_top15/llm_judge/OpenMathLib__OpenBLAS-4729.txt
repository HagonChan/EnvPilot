"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The build process completed successfully, and the test cases were executed without errors. The output shows that various test routines (e.g., `cblas_cgemm3m`, `cblas_zgemm3m`) passed the computational tests, confirming that the test suite executed and finished successfully. The test framework generated a complete test report structure, including details about the tests and their results.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules were built and installed successfully. The library (`libopenblas_skylakexp-r0.3.27.dev.a`) was generated, and the headers and libraries were installed to `/usr/local/include` and `/usr/local/lib`, respectively. The installation process also generated configuration files (`openblas.pc`, `OpenBLASConfig.cmake`), which are essential for integrating the library with other projects. The core functionality was verified through the successful execution of the test cases.\n\nBoth conditions for successful environment configuration are met: the test suite executed successfully, and the core functionality was verified."
