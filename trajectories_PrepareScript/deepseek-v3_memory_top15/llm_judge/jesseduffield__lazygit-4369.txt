"PASSED\nDetailed reasoning:\n1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):\n   - The agent successfully ran `make test` which executed both unit tests (`go test ./... -short`) and integration tests (`go test pkg/integration/clients/*.go`)\n   - The test framework generated complete test reports, showing which tests passed and which packages had no tests\n   - While some packages had no tests (marked with `?`), the test suite completed successfully with many packages passing (marked with `ok`)\n\n2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):\n   - The main Go modules were successfully imported and used, as evidenced by the test execution\n   - The core functionality was verified through the successful execution of both unit and integration tests\n   - The agent demonstrated the project could be built and its tests run after proper environment configuration\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria:\n- At least one complete test suite executed and finished successfully\n- Core functionality was verified through test execution and module imports\n- The agent resolved all environment issues (Go installation, system dependencies, Git configuration) to achieve this state"
