"PASSED\n1. Condition 1: Test Suite Execution - The Maven test command (`mvn test`) completed successfully, indicating that at least one complete test suite executed and finished. The output shows \"BUILD SUCCESS\" for all modules, confirming that the test framework generated a complete test report structure.\n\n2. Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification - The successful build (`mvn clean install`) of all project modules demonstrates that the main functional components can be compiled and installed. The test execution further verifies that core functionality is working as expected, as evidenced by the passing tests across all modules.\n\nThe agent successfully configured the environment by:\n- Installing Java 21 as specified in the CI configuration\n- Installing Maven for build automation\n- Resolving additional dependencies (curl, xorriso/genisoimage)\n- Completing the build process\n- Executing all test suites successfully\n\nWhile there were initial build failures due to missing dependencies, the agent systematically identified and resolved each issue, ultimately achieving both success criteria. The test suite completion and successful build demonstrate that the core functionality is operational."
