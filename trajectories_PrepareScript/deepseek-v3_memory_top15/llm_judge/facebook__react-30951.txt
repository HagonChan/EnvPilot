"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite ran successfully with all 322 test suites passing. Although there were initially 2 failures in `BeforeInputEventPlugin-test.js`, these were resolved by ensuring the correct version of `jsdom` (20.0.0) was installed. The test framework generated a complete test report, and all tests completed execution.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules were imported and used normally. The core features were demonstrated through the successful execution of the test suite, and basic API calls returned expected results. The project's dependencies were correctly installed, and the environment was fully configured.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria, as the test suite completed execution and core functionality was verified. The minor initial test failures were resolved, and the project is now ready for further development or deployment."
