"PASSED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe environment configuration successfully meets both success criteria:\n\n**Condition 1: Test Suite Execution** ✓\n- The test suite successfully started, executed, and completed with a comprehensive test report\n- 128 out of 137 test files passed (93% success rate)\n- 671 out of 682 individual tests passed (98% success rate)\n- The testing framework (Vitest) generated a complete report structure showing test durations, pass/fail status, and detailed error information\n- While 9 test files and 11 individual tests failed, these appear to be specific test case failures rather than framework-level issues\n\n**Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification** ✓\n- All project dependencies were successfully installed using pnpm\n- The build system (Turbo) executed properly for code generation tasks\n- Core modules were able to be imported and executed as evidenced by the successful test runs\n- The testing framework was able to run the majority of test cases across multiple packages\n- System dependencies (Node.js, pnpm, PostgreSQL, build tools) were all properly configured\n\nThe test failures observed appear to be specific to certain test cases rather than fundamental environment configuration issues. The environment supports both test execution and core functionality as required by the success criteria."
