"PASSED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n**Condition 1: Test Suite Execution** ✓\n- The test suite executed successfully with `ctest` completing its run\n- 711 tests were executed with the majority passing (705 passed, 6 failed)\n- The testing framework generated a complete test report structure with detailed pass/fail/skip status\n- Individual test failures (6 out of 711) are acceptable as they appear to be GPU-related tests that require specific hardware/dependencies not present in the environment\n\n**Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification** ✓\n- The project built successfully from source using CMake and Ninja\n- Core C++ modules compiled without errors (4012 build steps completed)\n- The build included all major components: runtime, generators, autoschedulers, and test infrastructure\n- Basic functionality is demonstrated by the successful execution of hundreds of test cases covering core features\n\n**Key Success Indicators:**\n- CMake configuration completed successfully with proper LLVM 17 detection\n- Complete build process finished without critical errors\n- Test framework executed and produced comprehensive results\n- Core functionality tests (correctness, performance, error handling) passed\n- Only GPU-specific tests and some tutorials failed, which is expected in a non-GPU environment\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria: the test suite completed execution and core functionality is verified through successful build and test execution."
