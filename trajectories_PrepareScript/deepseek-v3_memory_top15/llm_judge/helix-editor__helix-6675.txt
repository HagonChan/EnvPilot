"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The `cargo test` command successfully executed, running 14 tests in the `helix-term` crate, all of which passed. Additionally, doc-tests and integration tests were executed without failures. This meets the success criterion of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project built successfully, and the test suite ran without any critical errors. The ability to compile and run tests confirms that core modules can be imported and used normally, and basic functionality is intact. The test report structure was generated as expected.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful because both conditions (test suite execution and core functionality verification) are satisfied. The agent correctly installed the required Rust toolchain (1.65.0), system dependencies (`libssl-dev`, `pkg-config`, `build-essential`), and verified the setup by running tests. Although the full `cargo test --workspace` timed out, the simpler `cargo test` demonstrated that the environment is functional and tests can complete successfully."
