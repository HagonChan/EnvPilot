"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully built and executed multiple test suites (e.g., `flb-rt-core-timeout`, `flb-rt-out_file`, `flb-rt-filter_grep`). These tests completed successfully and generated output, confirming that the test framework is operational and tests can run to completion. Individual test cases passed, meeting the success criteria for test suite execution.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent successfully built the `fluent-bit` binary and verified core functionality by running test cases that exercise key features (timeout handling, file output, grep filtering). The tests demonstrated that main functional modules can be imported and used normally, and basic API calls return expected results.\n\nThe environment configuration is successful as both critical criteria are met:\n- At least one complete test suite executed and finished successfully.\n- Core functionality was verified through test execution and example code."
