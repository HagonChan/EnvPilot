"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully with all 341 tests passing. The Mocha test framework generated a complete test report structure, meeting Condition 1 of the success criteria.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality was verified through the successful execution of the test suite, which includes importing and using main functional modules, making API calls, and demonstrating core features. This meets Condition 2 of the success criteria.\n\nThe environment configuration was successful as both conditions were satisfied: the test suite completed execution without critical errors, and the core functionality was verified. The presence of npm audit vulnerabilities does not affect the success criteria as they are non-critical to the basic operability of the framework."
