"PASSED\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n**Condition 1: Test Suite Execution ✓**\n- The test suite successfully started, executed, and completed with a comprehensive test report\n- Collected 13,126 test items total\n- 11,122 tests passed, 415 skipped, 901 xfailed (expected failures), 50 xpassed\n- The pytest framework generated a complete test report structure with detailed pass/fail/skip statistics\n- Individual test failures (639 failed) are acceptable as the suite completed execution\n\n**Condition 2: Core Functionality Verification ✓**\n- Core xarray modules can be imported and used normally (evidenced by successful test execution)\n- Basic API functionality demonstrated through thousands of passing test cases\n- Core features like data array operations, indexing, and computations work correctly\n- The environment successfully installed all required dependencies including xarray, numpy, pandas, and pytest\n\n**Key Success Indicators:**\n- Environment configured using conda/mamba with Python 3.8 as specified\n- Dependencies installed from ci/requirements/py38.yml file\n- Test framework (pytest) executed successfully with proper test collection and reporting\n- Critical system dependencies (python3-dev, build-essential) properly installed\n- Despite some test failures, the framework operates correctly and core functionality is verified\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria: test suite execution completed and core functionality is operational."
