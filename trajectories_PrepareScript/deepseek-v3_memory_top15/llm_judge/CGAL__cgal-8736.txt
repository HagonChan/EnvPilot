"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The agent successfully ran the test suite using `ctest --output-on-failure -L Installation`, and all 41 tests passed. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully, with the testing framework generating a complete test report structure.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The agent successfully configured the environment, installed all necessary dependencies, built the project using CMake and make, and executed the tests. The successful build and test execution demonstrate that the core functionality of the project is operational, as the tests would not pass if the core modules were fundamentally broken or unable to be imported."
