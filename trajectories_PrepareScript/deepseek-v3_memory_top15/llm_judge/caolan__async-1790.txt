"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite executed successfully with all 679 tests passing. The Mocha test framework generated a complete test report structure, confirming that the test suite completed without critical failures.\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The main functional modules were imported and used normally, as evidenced by the successful execution of the test suite. Core features were demonstrated through the test cases, and basic API calls returned expected results.\n\nThe environment configuration meets both success criteria, despite the initial challenges with Node.js and npm installation. The tests completed successfully, and the core functionality was verified. The vulnerabilities reported by `npm audit` do not affect the current success criteria as they are related to dependencies rather than the core functionality or test execution."
