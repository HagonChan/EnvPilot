"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The `test:unit` script successfully executed, running 58 tests with all passing. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish successfully. The coverage report was generated, indicating the test framework produced a complete test report structure.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The project was successfully built using `pnpm build`, and core modules were verified to be importable and functional through the unit tests. The successful execution of the unit tests demonstrates that the main functional modules can be imported and used normally, and basic API calls return expected results.\n\nWhile the Playwright-based tests failed due to missing system dependencies, this does not affect the success criteria since:\n- The failure was limited to browser-specific tests\n- The core functionality was verified through other test suites\n- The test framework successfully executed and completed other test suites\n- The project's build process completed successfully\n\nThe environment configuration is considered successful as it meets both critical criteria despite the Playwright test failures, which are non-critical for the overall evaluation."
