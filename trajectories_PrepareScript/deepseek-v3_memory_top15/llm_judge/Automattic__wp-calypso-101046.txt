"FAILED\nDetailed Reasoning:\n\n1. Test Suite Execution (Condition 1):\n- The test suite failed to complete successfully due to multiple critical issues:\n  * Missing decrypted secrets (E2E_SECRETS_KEY not provided)\n  * Timeout errors when attempting to run tests\n  * Child process exceptions in Jest\n- While some tests passed (3 out of 96), the majority failed due to these fundamental issues\n- The test framework (Jest) did generate output, but the suite did not complete in a meaningful way\n\n2. Core Functionality Verification (Condition 2):\n- Core modules could not be properly verified due to the test failures\n- While the linting process completed (with warnings), this doesn't verify actual functionality\n- The end-to-end tests that would verify core functionality all failed\n- No successful API calls or example executions were demonstrated\n\n3. Environment Configuration:\n- The agent successfully installed the correct Node.js and Yarn versions\n- Dependencies were installed, though with some optional dependency build issues\n- The environment was properly configured for headless browser testing\n- However, the missing secrets prevented proper test execution\n\n4. Failure Conditions Met:\n- The testing framework could not execute normally due to missing secrets\n- Core functionality could not be verified\n- The agent reached the maximum practical configuration steps without achieving basic test execution\n\nWhile the environment was mostly correctly configured, the inability to execute tests due to missing secrets and the subsequent test failures mean the success criteria were not met. The configuration cannot be considered successful without at least one complete test suite execution and core functionality verification."
