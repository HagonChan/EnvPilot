"PASSED\n1. **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite was successfully executed with `make test`, which ran pytest with coverage. While there was 1 failure (`test_logistic_perfect_separation`), the vast majority of tests (1896 passed, 15 skipped, 6 xfailed) completed successfully, generating a comprehensive test report. This meets the success criteria of having at least one complete test suite execute and finish, even with some individual test failures.\n\n2. **Core Functionality Verification**: The core functionality was verified through:\n   - Successful installation of all dependencies including Python 3.10, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and other required packages\n   - The project was successfully installed in development mode with `pip install .[dev,stats]`\n   - The test framework (pytest) was able to import and execute tests from all major modules\n   - The coverage report shows that most core modules were imported and tested successfully\n\nThe single test failure appears to be an edge case rather than a fundamental environment configuration issue, as the majority of tests passed and the core functionality was verified. The environment was properly configured with all necessary system dependencies (make, pandoc) and Python packages."
