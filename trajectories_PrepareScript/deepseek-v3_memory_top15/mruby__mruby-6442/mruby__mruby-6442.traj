The root cause was missing essential packages for Ruby development. The solution was to install Ruby, Ruby development headers, and build tools using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y ruby ruby-dev build-essential\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: A deprecated method (File.exists?) caused a failure in the Rake build script\n    - Solution: The root cause was the use of an outdated Ruby method in the build configuration, which is no longer supported in modern Ruby versions. The solution was to replace all occurrences of 'File.exists?' with the current standard 'File.exist?' in the vendor.rake file to maintain compatibility.\n    - Action: Edit 'rakelib/vendor.rake' to replace 'File.exists?' with 'File.exist?'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The Gradle build failed due to an incompatible Ruby version.\n    - Solution: The project required JRuby 9.1.12.0, but the system's default Ruby version (2.5.8) was outdated. The root cause was a version mismatch in the environment. The solution was to install RVM (Ruby Version Manager) and the specified JRuby version to align with project requirements.\n    - Action: gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB && \\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby=jruby-9.1.12.0\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Bundler gem installation failed due to Ruby version incompatibility\n    - Solution: The default 'gem install bundler' failed because the installed JRuby (Ruby 2.5) was incompatible with the latest Bundler (requiring Ruby \u2265 3.1). The root cause was a version mismatch in the environment's Ruby configuration. The solution was to install a compatible older version of Bundler.\n    - Action: gem install bundler -v 2.3.27\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Development tools and libraries were missing for Ruby compilation\n    - Solution: The project's Dockerfile listed essential build dependencies (zlib, libssl, etc.), but these were not present. The root cause was an incomplete development environment configuration. The solution was to install all required development packages.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Default bundler gem version required incompatible Ruby version\n    - Solution: The latest bundler gem required Ruby \u22653.1.0, but the installed JRuby provided Ruby 2.5.8. The root cause was version incompatibility. The solution was to install a compatible bundler version (2.3.27).\n    - Action: jruby -S gem install bundler -v 2.3.27\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The initial compiler and build tool check failed due to missing software\n    - Solution: The gcc and make tools were not installed on the Ubuntu system, which are essential for compiling and building C/C++ projects from source. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking the basic build toolchain. The solution was to install the build-essential package using apt-get, which provides gcc, make, and related dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install RVM (Ruby Version Manager) and the specified JRuby version to align with project requirements.\n    - Action: gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB && \\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby=jruby-9.1.12.0\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment.

The root cause was a version mismatch in the environment's Ruby configuration. The solution was to install a compatible older version of Bundler.\n    - Action: gem install bundler -v 2.3.27\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Development tools and libraries were missing for Ruby compilation\n    - Solution: The project's Dockerfile listed essential build dependencies (zlib, libssl, etc.), but these were not present. The root cause was an incomplete development environment configuration. The solution was to install all required development packages.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Default bundler gem version required incompatible Ruby version\n    - Solution: The latest bundler gem required Ruby \u22653.1.0, but the installed JRuby provided Ruby 2.5.8. The root cause was version incompatibility. The solution was to install a compatible bundler version (2.3.27).\n    - Action: jruby -S gem install bundler -v 2.3.27\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The initial compiler and build tool check failed due to missing software\n    - Solution: The gcc and make tools were not installed on the Ubuntu system, which are essential for compiling and building C/C++ projects from source. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking the basic build toolchain. The solution was to install the build-essential package using apt-get, which provides gcc, make, and related dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The root cause was missing essential packages for Ruby development. The solution was to install Ruby, Ruby development headers, and build tools using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y ruby ruby-dev build-essential\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: A deprecated method (File.exists?) caused a failure in the Rake build script\n    - Solution: The root cause was the use of an outdated Ruby method in the build configuration, which is no longer supported in modern Ruby versions. The solution was to replace all occurrences of 'File.exists?' with the current standard 'File.exist?' in the vendor.rake file to maintain compatibility.\n    - Action: Edit 'rakelib/vendor.rake' to replace 'File.exists?' with 'File.exist?'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The Gradle build failed due to an incompatible Ruby version.\n    - Solution: The project required JRuby 9.1.12.0, but the system's default Ruby version (2.5.8) was outdated. The root cause was a version mismatch in the environment. The solution was to install RVM (Ruby Version Manager) and the specified JRuby version to align with project requirements.\n    - Action: gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB && \\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby=jruby-9.1.12.0\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Bundler gem installation failed due to Ruby version incompatibility\n    - Solution: The default 'gem install bundler' failed because the installed JRuby (Ruby 2.5) was incompatible with the latest Bundler (requiring Ruby \u2265 3.1). The root cause was a version mismatch in the environment's Ruby configuration. The solution was to install a compatible older version of Bundler.\n    - Action: gem install bundler -v 2.3.27\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Development tools and libraries were missing for Ruby compilation\n    - Solution: The project's Dockerfile listed essential build dependencies (zlib, libssl, etc.), but these were not present. The root cause was an incomplete development environment configuration. The solution was to install all required development packages.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Default bundler gem version required incompatible Ruby version\n    - Solution: The latest bundler gem required Ruby \u22653.1.0, but the installed JRuby provided Ruby 2.5.8. The root cause was version incompatibility. The solution was to install a compatible bundler version (2.3.27).\n    - Action: jruby -S gem install bundler -v 2.3.27\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The initial compiler and build tool check failed due to missing software\n    - Solution: The gcc and make tools were not installed on the Ubuntu system, which are essential for compiling and building C/C++ projects from source. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking the basic build toolchain. The solution was to install the build-essential package using apt-get, which provides gcc, make, and related dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- rake\nlanguage:\n  name: Ruby\n  version_constraint: 3.x\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: rake all test\n  name: rake\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - clang\n  - ruby\n  likely_required:\n  - make\n  - bison\n  - ruby-dev\ntest_framework:\n- rake test:run:serial\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The rake command was not found when attempting to bootstrap the project\n    - Solution: The required Ruby development tools were not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing project setup. The root cause was missing essential packages for Ruby development. The solution was to install Ruby, Ruby development headers, and build tools using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y ruby ruby-dev build-essential\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: A deprecated method (File.exists?) caused a failure in the Rake build script\n    - Solution: The root cause was the use of an outdated Ruby method in the build configuration, which is no longer supported in modern Ruby versions. The solution was to replace all occurrences of 'File.exists?' with the current standard 'File.exist?' in the vendor.rake file to maintain compatibility.\n    - Action: Edit 'rakelib/vendor.rake' to replace 'File.exists?' with 'File.exist?'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The Gradle build failed due to an incompatible Ruby version.\n    - Solution: The project required JRuby 9.1.12.0, but the system's default Ruby version (2.5.8) was outdated. The root cause was a version mismatch in the environment. The solution was to install RVM (Ruby Version Manager) and the specified JRuby version to align with project requirements.\n    - Action: gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB && \\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby=jruby-9.1.12.0\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Bundler gem installation failed due to Ruby version incompatibility\n    - Solution: The default 'gem install bundler' failed because the installed JRuby (Ruby 2.5) was incompatible with the latest Bundler (requiring Ruby \u2265 3.1). The root cause was a version mismatch in the environment's Ruby configuration. The solution was to install a compatible older version of Bundler.\n    - Action: gem install bundler -v 2.3.27\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Development tools and libraries were missing for Ruby compilation\n    - Solution: The project's Dockerfile listed essential build dependencies (zlib, libssl, etc.), but these were not present. The root cause was an incomplete development environment configuration. The solution was to install all required development packages.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Default bundler gem version required incompatible Ruby version\n    - Solution: The latest bundler gem required Ruby \u22653.1.0, but the installed JRuby provided Ruby 2.5.8. The root cause was version incompatibility. The solution was to install a compatible bundler version (2.3.27).\n    - Action: jruby -S gem install bundler -v 2.3.27\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The initial compiler and build tool check failed due to missing software\n    - Solution: The gcc and make tools were not installed on the Ubuntu system, which are essential for compiling and building C/C++ projects from source. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking the basic build toolchain. The solution was to install the build-essential package using apt-get, which provides gcc, make, and related dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- rake\nlanguage:\n  name: Ruby\n  version_constraint: 3.x\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: rake all test\n  name: rake\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - clang\n  - ruby\n  likely_required:\n  - make\n  - bison\n  - ruby-dev\ntest_framework:\n- rake test:run:serial\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The rake command was not found when attempting to bootstrap the project\n    - Solution: The required Ruby development tools were not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing project setup. The root cause was missing essential packages for Ruby development. The solution was to install Ruby, Ruby development headers, and build tools using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y ruby ruby-dev build-essential\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: A deprecated method (File.exists?) caused a failure in the Rake build script\n    - Solution: The root cause was the use of an outdated Ruby method in the build configuration, which is no longer supported in modern Ruby versions. The solution was to replace all occurrences of 'File.exists?' with the current standard 'File.exist?' in the vendor.rake file to maintain compatibility.\n    - Action: Edit 'rakelib/vendor.rake' to replace 'File.exists?' with 'File.exist?'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The Gradle build failed due to an incompatible Ruby version.\n    - Solution: The project required JRuby 9.1.12.0, but the system's default Ruby version (2.5.8) was outdated. The root cause was a version mismatch in the environment. The solution was to install RVM (Ruby Version Manager) and the specified JRuby version to align with project requirements.\n    - Action: gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB && \\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby=jruby-9.1.12.0\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Bundler gem installation failed due to Ruby version incompatibility\n    - Solution: The default 'gem install bundler' failed because the installed JRuby (Ruby 2.5) was incompatible with the latest Bundler (requiring Ruby \u2265 3.1). The root cause was a version mismatch in the environment's Ruby configuration. The solution was to install a compatible older version of Bundler.\n    - Action: gem install bundler -v 2.3.27\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Development tools and libraries were missing for Ruby compilation\n    - Solution: The project's Dockerfile listed essential build dependencies (zlib, libssl, etc.), but these were not present. The root cause was an incomplete development environment configuration. The solution was to install all required development packages.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Default bundler gem version required incompatible Ruby version\n    - Solution: The latest bundler gem required Ruby \u22653.1.0, but the installed JRuby provided Ruby 2.5.8. The root cause was version incompatibility. The solution was to install a compatible bundler version (2.3.27).\n    - Action: jruby -S gem install bundler -v 2.3.27\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The initial compiler and build tool check failed due to missing software\n    - Solution: The gcc and make tools were not installed on the Ubuntu system, which are essential for compiling and building C/C++ projects from source. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking the basic build toolchain. The solution was to install the build-essential package using apt-get, which provides gcc, make, and related dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- rake\nlanguage:\n  name: Ruby\n  version_constraint: 3.x\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: rake all test\n  name: rake\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - clang\n  - ruby\n  likely_required:\n  - make\n  - bison\n  - ruby-dev\ntest_framework:\n- rake test:run:serial\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The rake command was not found when attempting to bootstrap the project\n    - Solution: The required Ruby development tools were not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing project setup. The root cause was missing essential packages for Ruby development. The solution was to install Ruby, Ruby development headers, and build tools using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y ruby ruby-dev build-essential\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: A deprecated method (File.exists?) caused a failure in the Rake build script\n    - Solution: The root cause was the use of an outdated Ruby method in the build configuration, which is no longer supported in modern Ruby versions. The solution was to replace all occurrences of 'File.exists?' with the current standard 'File.exist?' in the vendor.rake file to maintain compatibility.\n    - Action: Edit 'rakelib/vendor.rake' to replace 'File.exists?' with 'File.exist?'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The Gradle build failed due to an incompatible Ruby version.\n    - Solution: The project required JRuby 9.1.12.0, but the system's default Ruby version (2.5.8) was outdated. The root cause was a version mismatch in the environment. The solution was to install RVM (Ruby Version Manager) and the specified JRuby version to align with project requirements.\n    - Action: gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB && \\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby=jruby-9.1.12.0\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Bundler gem installation failed due to Ruby version incompatibility\n    - Solution: The default 'gem install bundler' failed because the installed JRuby (Ruby 2.5) was incompatible with the latest Bundler (requiring Ruby \u2265 3.1). The root cause was a version mismatch in the environment's Ruby configuration. The solution was to install a compatible older version of Bundler.\n    - Action: gem install bundler -v 2.3.27\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Development tools and libraries were missing for Ruby compilation\n    - Solution: The project's Dockerfile listed essential build dependencies (zlib, libssl, etc.), but these were not present. The root cause was an incomplete development environment configuration. The solution was to install all required development packages.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Default bundler gem version required incompatible Ruby version\n    - Solution: The latest bundler gem required Ruby \u22653.1.0, but the installed JRuby provided Ruby 2.5.8. The root cause was version incompatibility. The solution was to install a compatible bundler version (2.3.27).\n    - Action: jruby -S gem install bundler -v 2.3.27\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The initial compiler and build tool check failed due to missing software\n    - Solution: The gcc and make tools were not installed on the Ubuntu system, which are essential for compiling and building C/C++ projects from source. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking the basic build toolchain. The solution was to install the build-essential package using apt-get, which provides gcc, make, and related dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The root cause was missing essential packages for Ruby development. The solution was to install Ruby, Ruby development headers, and build tools using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y ruby ruby-dev build-essential\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: A deprecated method (File.exists?) caused a failure in the Rake build script\n    - Solution: The root cause was the use of an outdated Ruby method in the build configuration, which is no longer supported in modern Ruby versions. The solution was to replace all occurrences of 'File.exists?' with the current standard 'File.exist?' in the vendor.rake file to maintain compatibility.\n    - Action: Edit 'rakelib/vendor.rake' to replace 'File.exists?' with 'File.exist?'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The Gradle build failed due to an incompatible Ruby version.\n    - Solution: The project required JRuby 9.1.12.0, but the system's default Ruby version (2.5.8) was outdated. The root cause was a version mismatch in the environment. The solution was to install RVM (Ruby Version Manager) and the specified JRuby version to align with project requirements.\n    - Action: gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB && \\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby=jruby-9.1.12.0\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Bundler gem installation failed due to Ruby version incompatibility\n    - Solution: The default 'gem install bundler' failed because the installed JRuby (Ruby 2.5) was incompatible with the latest Bundler (requiring Ruby \u2265 3.1). The root cause was a version mismatch in the environment's Ruby configuration. The solution was to install a compatible older version of Bundler.\n    - Action: gem install bundler -v 2.3.27\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Development tools and libraries were missing for Ruby compilation\n    - Solution: The project's Dockerfile listed essential build dependencies (zlib, libssl, etc.), but these were not present. The root cause was an incomplete development environment configuration. The solution was to install all required development packages.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Default bundler gem version required incompatible Ruby version\n    - Solution: The latest bundler gem required Ruby \u22653.1.0, but the installed JRuby provided Ruby 2.5.8. The root cause was version incompatibility. The solution was to install a compatible bundler version (2.3.27).\n    - Action: jruby -S gem install bundler -v 2.3.27\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The initial compiler and build tool check failed due to missing software\n    - Solution: The gcc and make tools were not installed on the Ubuntu system, which are essential for compiling and building C/C++ projects from source. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking the basic build toolchain. The solution was to install the build-essential package using apt-get, which provides gcc, make, and related dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools:\n- rake\nlanguage:\n  name: Ruby\n  version_constraint: 3.x\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: null\n  install_command: rake all test\n  name: rake\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - gcc\n  - clang\n  - ruby\n  likely_required:\n  - make\n  - bison\n  - ruby-dev\ntest_framework:\n- rake test:run:serial\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: The rake command was not found when attempting to bootstrap the project\n    - Solution: The required Ruby development tools were not installed in the Ubuntu environment, preventing project setup. The root cause was missing essential packages for Ruby development. The solution was to install Ruby, Ruby development headers, and build tools using apt-get.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y ruby ruby-dev build-essential\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: A deprecated method (File.exists?) caused a failure in the Rake build script\n    - Solution: The root cause was the use of an outdated Ruby method in the build configuration, which is no longer supported in modern Ruby versions. The solution was to replace all occurrences of 'File.exists?' with the current standard 'File.exist?' in the vendor.rake file to maintain compatibility.\n    - Action: Edit 'rakelib/vendor.rake' to replace 'File.exists?' with 'File.exist?'\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: The Gradle build failed due to an incompatible Ruby version.\n    - Solution: The project required JRuby 9.1.12.0, but the system's default Ruby version (2.5.8) was outdated. The root cause was a version mismatch in the environment. The solution was to install RVM (Ruby Version Manager) and the specified JRuby version to align with project requirements.\n    - Action: gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB && \\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby=jruby-9.1.12.0\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: Test runner used an incompatible Python version (3.13) causing dependency resolution failures\n    - Solution: The pytest command defaulted to Python 3.13, which lacked compatible dependencies. The root cause was incorrect Python version specification in the test execution environment. The solution was explicitly configuring the test command to use Python 3.11 for pytest execution.\n    - Action: echo 'python3.11 -m pytest --no-header -rA --tb=no -p no:cacheprovider' > /home/conan/test_commands.sh\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Bundler gem installation failed due to Ruby version incompatibility\n    - Solution: The default 'gem install bundler' failed because the installed JRuby (Ruby 2.5) was incompatible with the latest Bundler (requiring Ruby \u2265 3.1). The root cause was a version mismatch in the environment's Ruby configuration. The solution was to install a compatible older version of Bundler.\n    - Action: gem install bundler -v 2.3.27\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Development tools and libraries were missing for Ruby compilation\n    - Solution: The project's Dockerfile listed essential build dependencies (zlib, libssl, etc.), but these were not present. The root cause was an incomplete development environment configuration. The solution was to install all required development packages.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: The test suite failed due to missing system dependencies during execution.\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of essential build tools (Subversion for version control operations and GCC compiler suite for C/C++ tests) in the environment configuration. These dependencies were required by the test suite but not pre-installed. The solution involved installing the missing packages via the system package manager after updating the package index.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y subversion build-essential\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Default bundler gem version required incompatible Ruby version\n    - Solution: The latest bundler gem required Ruby \u22653.1.0, but the installed JRuby provided Ruby 2.5.8. The root cause was version incompatibility. The solution was to install a compatible bundler version (2.3.27).\n    - Action: jruby -S gem install bundler -v 2.3.27\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: The initial compiler and build tool check failed due to missing software\n    - Solution: The gcc and make tools were not installed on the Ubuntu system, which are essential for compiling and building C/C++ projects from source. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup lacking the basic build toolchain. The solution was to install the build-essential package using apt-get, which provides gcc, make, and related dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y build-essential\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\",\"instance_template\":\"We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\\n\\n{{repo_related_info}}\\n\\n{{cross_repo_knowledge}}\\n\\nTASK TIPS:\\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.\",\"next_step_template\":\"{{observation}}\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"next_step_no_output_template\":\"Your command ran successfully and did not produce any output.\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"strategy_template\":null,\"demonstration_template\":null,\"success_reflection_template\":\"You are an expert code assistant who just successfully repaired a software project in an automated programming session.
