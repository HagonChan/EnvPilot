Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nesbot/carbon\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - tzdata\n  - locales\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nesbot/carbon\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - tzdata\n  - locales\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nesbot/carbon\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - tzdata\n  - locales\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nesbot/carbon\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - tzdata\n  - locales\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML.

The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nesbot/carbon\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - tzdata\n  - locales\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nesbot/carbon\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - tzdata\n  - locales\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nesbot/carbon\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - tzdata\n  - locales\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nesbot/carbon\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - tzdata\n  - locales\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nesbot/carbon\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - tzdata\n  - locales\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nesbot/carbon\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - tzdata\n  - locales\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nesbot/carbon\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - tzdata\n  - locales\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nesbot/carbon\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - tzdata\n  - locales\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nesbot/carbon\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - tzdata\n  - locales\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nesbot/carbon\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - tzdata\n  - locales\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nesbot/carbon\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - tzdata\n  - locales\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nesbot/carbon\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - tzdata\n  - locales\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nesbot/carbon\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - tzdata\n  - locales\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nesbot/carbon\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - tzdata\n  - locales\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nesbot/carbon\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - tzdata\n  - locales\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nesbot/carbon\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - tzdata\n  - locales\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nesbot/carbon\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - tzdata\n  - locales\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nesbot/carbon\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - tzdata\n  - locales\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nesbot/carbon\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - tzdata\n  - locales\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

          "content": "We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nesbot/carbon\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - tzdata\n  - locales\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\n\nbuild_tools: []\nlanguage:\n  name: PHP\n  version_constraint: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4\npackage_manager:\n  config_file: composer.json\n  install_command: composer require nesbot/carbon\n  name: composer\nsystem_dependencies:\n  identified_in_ci:\n  - tzdata\n  - locales\n  likely_required: []\ntest_framework:\n- phpunit\n\n\nHere is some helpful knowledge about configure this repository:\n\n**Case1**:\n    - Problem: A project dependency required a Node.js version that was incompatible with the environment's installed version\n    - Solution: The root cause was a version mismatch where the dependency '@getinsomnia/node-libcurl' required Node.js >=22.15.0, but the environment had version 20.11.1. This was resolved by upgrading Node.js to a compatible version (22.16.0) using nvm.\n    - Action: nvm install 22.16.0 && nvm use 22.16.0\n\n**Case2**:\n    - Problem: The project's engine constraint rejected the installed Node.js version during dependency installation\n    - Solution: The root cause was the project's package.json specifying Node.js >=20.11.1 and <22, which conflicted with the upgraded version (22.16.0). Installing a Node.js version within the required range (21.7.3) resolved the engine incompatibility.\n    - Action: nvm install 21.7.3 && nvm use 21.7.3\n\n**Case3**:\n    - Problem: Python 3.13 was incompatible with project dependencies\n    - Solution: The default Python version (3.13) lacked compatibility with critical dependencies like PyYAML. The root cause was unsupported Python versions in dependency wheels. The solution was to install Python 3.11 and create a virtual environment to isolate the project runtime.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev && python3.11 -m venv venv\n\n**Case4**:\n    - Problem: The npm command was not found when attempting to install project dependencies\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of Node.js and npm on the Ubuntu system, which are required for building and managing Node.js projects. This occurred because the environment lacked these essential tools. The solution involved installing Node.js and npm using the system package manager after updating the package index to ensure availability of the latest versions.\n    - Action: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\n\n**Case5**:\n    - Problem: Missing locale configuration for test cases requiring Japanese locale\n    - Solution: The test case 'ChronoTest.Locale' required the 'ja_JP.utf8' locale which was not installed in the environment. This is a common issue when running tests that depend on specific locale settings. The root cause was an incomplete locale configuration in the base Ubuntu image. Since the test passed despite the missing locale (likely due to graceful fallback handling), no explicit solution was applied in the trajectory. However, in general environments, installing the missing locale package would resolve this.\n    - Action: sudo apt-get install -y locales-all && sudo locale-gen ja_JP.utf8\n\n**Case6**:\n    - Problem: Google Test was not installed, preventing test compilation and execution\n    - Solution: The root cause was the absence of the Google Test library, a dependency required for compiling and running tests in projects that use the Google Test framework. The solution was to install the Google Test development package to provide the necessary headers and libraries.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libgtest-dev\n\n**Case7**:\n    - Problem: Essential tools (gpg, curl) were missing during environment setup.\n    - Solution: The gpg and curl commands were required for secure key retrieval and script downloads but were not present in the base environment. The root cause was incomplete initial package configuration. The solution was to install these utilities via the system package manager.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y gnupg curl\n\n**Case8**:\n    - Problem: Test tools used the wrong Python version due to PATH misconfiguration\n    - Solution: The system PATH prioritized the old Python 3.6 binaries, causing tools like pytest to use the incorrect interpreter. The root cause was the PATH order in the environment. The solution was to prepend the Python 3.9 binary directory to PATH to ensure version consistency.\n    - Action: export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n\n**Case9**:\n    - Problem: Failure to install dependencies using common package managers\n    - Solution: The root cause was an incorrect package manager assumption for the operating system; the environment was Alpine Linux, which uses apk instead of apt-get, yum, or dnf. After identifying the OS via /etc/os-release, the solution was to use apk to install required build dependencies.\n    - Action: apk add binutils-gold clang clang-dev cmake make\n\n**Case10**:\n    - Problem: Test execution failed due to missing OpenSSL and PCRE2 libraries\n    - Solution: The test runner encountered linker errors for libcrypto, libpcre2-8, and libssl during test execution. The root cause was missing development packages for cryptography and regular expression functionality. The solution was to install libssl-dev and libpcre2-dev to resolve these dependencies.\n    - Action: apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpcre2-dev\n\n**Case11**:\n    - Problem: Missing standard library stubs causing test failures\n    - Solution: The typeshed submodule was not initialized, which provides essential stubs for Python standard libraries. This caused errors like 'No library stub file' and 'Cannot find module'. The root cause was an incomplete environment setup. The solution was to initialize and update the submodule using git commands.\n    - Action: git submodule update --init typeshed\n\n**Case12**:\n    - Problem: Rust version mismatch caused dependency resolution failures during project compilation\n    - Solution: The project required a specific Rust version (1.56.1) specified in Cargo.toml, but the default stable version was incompatible. The root cause was a version constraint mismatch in dependencies. The solution was to install and set the exact required Rust version.\n    - Action: rustup install 1.56.1 && rustup default 1.56.1\n\n\nTASK TIPS:\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\n\nGENERAL TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.",

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\",\"instance_template\":\"We are currently configuring the environment for the repository. Your task is to configure the environment and installs this project (on an Ubuntu Linux machine) from source code and runs test cases.\\n\\n{{repo_related_info}}\\n\\n{{cross_repo_knowledge}}\\n\\nTASK TIPS:\\n1. It is prohibited to directly install this repository using dependency package management tools. For example, if current repository is Django, directly running pip install Django is strictly prohibited.\\n2. **PRIORITY ORDER for environment configuration discovery:**\\n  a) **First, check CI/CD configuration files** (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .circleci/config.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.) - these often contain the most reliable setup steps and test commands\\n  b) If no CI/CD files exist or they're insufficient, check dependency/environment files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, Cargo.toml, etc.)\\n  c) Then examine README files (README.md, README.rst, etc.) for setup instructions\\n  d) Look for other configuration files (Makefile, tox.ini, environment.yml, etc.)\\n3. Always start by browsing the repository directory structure, with particular focus on the priority order above.\\n4. The choice of test framework should be determined by the repository's contents and CI/CD configurations.\\n5. It is strictly prohibited to modify the test cases in the code repository.\\n6. Do not create a new Dockerfile for environment isolation.\\n7. Commands can be run without sudo as the current session already has root privileges.\\n8. Based on the characteristics of the repository, it is possible to determine whether environment setup and test execution need to be performed within a virtual environment.\\n9. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.\\n10. If you encounter package installation failures, try updating your local package index.\\n11. **Pay special attention to CI/CD matrix configurations** - they often test multiple Python/Node.js/etc. versions and can guide your environment setup.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\\n4. When using the edit command, always quote both search and replace arguments to avoid argument parsing failures.\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.\",\"next_step_template\":\"{{observation}}\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"next_step_no_output_template\":\"Your command ran successfully and did not produce any output.\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"strategy_template\":null,\"demonstration_template\":null,\"success_reflection_template\":\"You are an expert code assistant who just successfully repaired a software project in an automated programming session.
